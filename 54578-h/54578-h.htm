<p>In speaking of my husband, I shall not call him "Sir
Richard," or "Burton," as many wives would; nor yet by the
pet name I used for him at home, which for some reason
which I cannot explain was "Jemmy;" nor yet what he was
generally called at home, and what his friends called him,
"Dick;" but I will call him Richard in speaking of him, and
"I" where he speaks on his own account, as he does in his
private journals. I always thought and told him that he
destroyed much of the interest of his works by hardly ever
alluding to himself, and now that I mention it, people may
remark it, that in writing he seldom uses the pronoun <i>I</i>. I
have therefore drawn, not from his books, but from his private
journals. It was one of his asceticisms, an act of humility,
which the world passed by, and probably only thought one
of his eccentricities. In his works he would generally speak
of himself as the Ensign, the Traveller, the Explorer, the
Consul, and so on, so that I often think that people who
are <i>not</i> earnest readers never understood <i>who</i> it was that did
this, thought that, or saw the other. If I make him speak
plainly for himself, as he does in his private journals, but
never to the public, it will give twenty times the interest in
relating events; so I shall throughout let him speak for
himself where I can.</p>

<p>In early January, 1876, Richard and I were on our way
to India for a six months' trip to visit the old haunts. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
divided our intended journey into two lots. We cut India
down the middle, the long way on the map, from north to
south, and took the western side, leaving the eastern side for
a trip which was deferred, alas! for our old age and retirement.
We utilized the voyage out (which occupied thirty-three
days in an Austrian Lloyd, used as a Haj, or pilgrim-ship),
and also the voyage back, in the part of the following
pages which refers to his early life, he dictating and I writing.</p>

<p>In 1887, when my husband was beginning to be a real
invalid, he lent some of these notes to Mr. Hitchman (who
asked leave to write his biography), Richard promising not
to tread upon his heels by his own Autobiography till he
should be free from service in 1891. It will not, I think,
do any harm to the reading public to reproduce it with
more detail, because only seven hundred people got Mr.
Hitchman's, who did not by any means use the whole of
the material before he returned it, and what I give is the
original just as Richard dictated it, and it is more needful,
because it deals with a part of his life that was only known
to himself, to me only by dictation; because everything that
he wrote of himself is infinitely precious, and because to leave
to the public a sketch of an early Richard Burton is desirable,
otherwise readers would be obliged to purchase Mr. Hitchman's,
as well as this work, in order to make a perfect whole.</p>

<p>I must take warning, however, that when Mr. Hitchman's
book came out, part of the Press found this account of my
husband's boyhood and youth charming, and another part
of the Press said that I was too candid, and did nothing to
gloss over the faults and foibles of the youthful Burtons;
they doubted the accuracy of my information&mdash;I was informed
that my style was too rough-and-ready, and of many
others of my shortcomings. In short, I was considered rather
as writing against my own husband, whilst both sides of the
Press in their reviews assumed that I wrote it; this charmed
Richard, and he would not let me refute. Not one word was
mine&mdash;it was only dictation, and peremptory dictation when
I objected to certain self-accusations. I beg leave to state
that I did not write one single word; I could not, for I did
not know it&mdash;and all that the family objected to, or considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
exaggerated, will not be repeated here. Before entering
on these pages, I must warn the reader not to expect
the goody-goody boy nor yet the precocious vicious youth
of 1893. It is the recital of a high-spirited lad of the old
school, full of animal spirits and manly notions, a lively sense
of fun and humour, reckless of the consequences of playing
tricks, but without a vestige of vice in the meaner or lower
forms&mdash;a lad, in short, who <i>would</i> be a gentleman and a man
of the world in his teens, and who, from his foreign travel,
had seen more of life than boys do brought up at home.</p>

<p>I do not begin this work&mdash;the last important work of my
life&mdash;without fear and trembling. If I can perform this sacred
duty&mdash;this labour of love&mdash;well,&mdash;I shall be glad indeed, but
I begin it with unfeigned humility. I have never needed any
one to point out to me that my husband was on a pedestal
far above <i>me</i>, or anybody else in the world. I have known
it from 1850 to 1893, from a young girl to an old widow, <i>i.e.</i>
for forty-three years. I feel that I cannot do justice to his
scientific life, that I may miss points in travel that would
have been more brilliantly treated by a clever man. My
only comfort is, that his travels and services are already
more or less known to the public, and that other books will
be written about them. But if I am so unfortunate as to
disappoint the public in <i>this</i> way, there is one thing that I
feel I <i>am</i> fit for, and that is to lift the veil as to the <i>inner</i>
man. He was misunderstood and unappreciated by the
world at large, during his life. No one ever thought of
looking for the real man beneath the cultivated mask that
generally hid all feelings and belief&mdash;but now the world is
beginning to know what it <i>has</i> lost. The old, old, sad story.</p>

<p>He shall tell his own tale till 1861, the first forty years,
annotated by me. Whilst dictating to me I sometimes
remarked, "Oh, do you think it would be well to write this?"
and the answer always was, "Yes! I do not see the use of
writing a biography at all, unless it is the exact truth, a very
photograph of the man or woman in question." On this
principle he taught me to write quite openly in the unconventional
and personal style&mdash;being the only way to make
a biography interesting, which we <i>now</i> class as the Marie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Bashkirtcheff style. As you will see, he always makes the
worst of himself, and offers no excuse. As a lad he does not
know what to do to show his manliness, and all that a boy
should, ought, and does think brave and honourable, be it wild
or not, all that he does.</p>

<p>What appals me is, that the task is one of such magnitude&mdash;the
enormous quantity of his books and writings that I have
to look through, and, out of eighty or more publications, to
ascertain what has seen the light and what has not, because
it is impossible to carry the work of forty-eight years in one's
head; and, again, the immense quantity of subjects he has
studied and written upon, some in only a fragmentary state,
is wonderful. My wish would be to produce this life, speaking
only of him&mdash;and afterwards to reproduce everything he has
written that has not been published. I propose putting all
the heavier matter, such as pamphlets, essays, letters, correspondence,
and the <i>résumé</i> of his works&mdash;that is, <i>what portion
shows his labours and works for the benefit of the human race</i>&mdash;into
two after-volumes, to be called "Labours and Wisdom
of Richard Burton." After his biography I shall renew <i>his</i>
"Arabian Nights" with his Forewords, Terminal Essay, and
Biography of the book in such form that it can be copyrighted&mdash;it
is now protected by <i>my</i> copyright. His "Catullus"
and "Pentamerone" are now more or less in the
Press, to be followed by degrees by all his unpublished works.
His hitherto published works I shall bring out as a Uniform
Library, so that not a word will be lost that he ever wrote
for the public. Fortunately, I have kept all his books classified
as he kept them himself, with a catalogue, and have separate
shelves ticketed and numbered; for example, "Sword,"
"Gypsy," "Pentamerone," "Camoens," and so on.</p>

<p>If I were sure of life, I should have wished for six months
to look through and sort our papers and materials before
I began this work, because I have five rooms full. Our
books, about eight thousand, only got housed in March, 1892,
and they <i>are</i> sorted&mdash;but not the papers and correspondence;
but I fancy that the public would rather have a
spontaneous work sooner, than wait longer. If I live I shall
always go on with them. I have no leisure to think of style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
or of polish, or to select the best language, the best English,&mdash;no
time to shine as an authoress. I must just think aloud,
so as not to keep the public waiting.</p>

<p>From the time of my husband's becoming a real invalid&mdash;February,
1887&mdash;whilst my constant thoughts reviewed the
dread To Come&mdash;the catastrophe of his death&mdash;and the
subsequent suffering, I have been totally incapable, except
writing his letters or attending to his business, of doing any
good literary work until July, 1892, a period of five years,
which was not improved by four attacks of influenza.</p>

<p>Richard was such a many-sided man, that he will have
appeared different to every set of people who knew him. He
was as a diamond with so many facets. The tender, the true,
the brilliant, the scientific,&mdash;and to those who deserved it, the
cynical, the hard, the severe. Loads of books will be written
about him, and every one will be different; and though perhaps
it is an unseemly boast, I venture to feel sure that mine will
be the truest one, for I have no interest to serve, no notoriety
to gain, belong to no party, have nothing to sway me,
except the desire to let the world understand what it once
possessed, what it has lost. With many it will mean <i>I</i>.
With me it means <i>HIM</i>.</p>

<p>When this biography is out, the public will, theoretically,
but not practically, know him as well as I can make them,
and all of his friends will be able after that to put forth
a work representing that particular facet of his character
which he turned on to them, or which they drew from him.
He was so great, so world-wide, he could turn a fresh facet
and sympathy on to each world. I always think that a man
is one character to his wife at his fireside corner, another man
to his <i>own</i> family, another man to <i>her</i> family, a fourth to a
mistress or an amourette&mdash;if he have one,&mdash;a fifth to his men
friends, a sixth to his boon companions, and a seventh to his
public, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>; but I think the wife, if they
are happy and love each other, gets the pearl out of the
seven oyster-shells.</p>

<p>I fear that this work will be too long. I cannot help it.
When I embarked on it I had no conception of the scope:
it was a labour of love. I thought I could fly over it; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
I have found that the more I worked, the more it grew, and
that the end receded from me like the mirage in the desert.
I only aim at giving a simple, true recital without comment,
and at fairness on all questions of whatever sort. I am very
personal, because I believe the public like it. I want to give
Richard as I knew him at home. I apologize in advance
to my readers if I am sometimes obliged to mention myself
oftener than they and I care about; but they will understand
that our lives were so interwoven, so bound together,
that I should very often spoil a good story or an anecdote
or a dialogue were I to leave myself out. It would be an
affectation that would spoil my work.</p>

<p>I am rather disheartened by being told by a literary friend
that the present British public likes its reading "in sips."
How <i>can</i> I give a life of seventy years, every moment of
which was employed in a remarkable way, "in sips"? It is
impossible. Though I must not detail much from his books,
I want to convey to the public, at least, what they were about;
striking points of travel, his schemes, wise warnings, advice,
and plans for the benefit of England&mdash;then what about
"sips"? It must not be dry, it must not be heavy, nor
tedious, nor voluminous; so it shall be personal, full of traits
of character, sentiments and opinions, brightened with cheerful
anecdotes, and the more serious part shall go into the
before-mentioned two volumes, the "Labours and Wisdom
of Richard Burton."</p>

<p>I am not putting in many letters, because he generally said
such personal things, that few would like them to be shown.
His business letters would not interest. To economize time
he used to get expressly made for him the smallest possible
pieces of paper, into which he used to cram the greatest
amount of news&mdash;telegram form. He only wrote much in
detail, if he had any literary business to transact.</p>

<p>One of my greatest difficulties, which I scarcely know how
to express, is, that which I think the most interesting, and
which most of my intimates think well worth exploring; it is
that of showing the dual man with, as it were, two natures in
one person, diametrically opposed to each other, of which he
was himself perfectly conscious. I had a party of literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
friends to dinner one night, and I put my manuscript on the
table before them after dinner, and I begged them each to take
a part and look over it. Feeling as I do that the general
public never understood him, and that his mantle after death
seemed to descend upon my shoulders, that everything I
say seems to be misunderstood, and that, in some few eyes,
I can do nothing right, I said at the end of the evening,
"If I endeavour to explain, will it not be throwing pearls to
swine?" (not that I meant, dear readers, to compare <i>you</i> to
swine&mdash;it is but an expression of thought well understood).
And the answer was, "Oh, Lady Burton, <i>do</i> give the world
the ins and outs of this remarkable and interesting character,
and let the swine take care of themselves." "If you leave
out by order" (said one) "religion and politics, the two
touchstones of the British public, you leave out the great
part of a man." "Mind you gloss over nothing to please
anybody" (said a second). I think they are right&mdash;one set
of people see one side, and another see another side, and
neither of the two will comprehend (like St. Thomas) anything
that they have not seen and felt; or, to quote one of Richard's
favourite mottoes from St. Augustine, "Let them laugh at
me for speaking of things which they do not understand, and
I must pity them, whilst they laugh at me." So I must
remain an unfortunate buffer amidst a cyclone of opinions.
I can only avoid controversies and opinions <i>of my own</i>, and
quote his and his actions.</p>

<p>These words are forced from me, because I have received
my orders, if not exactly from the public, from a few of
the friends who profess to know him best. I am ordered to
describe Richard as a sort of Didérot (a disciple of Voltaire's),
who wrote "that the world would never be quiet till the last
king was strangled with the bowels of the last priest,"&mdash;whereas
there was no one whom Richard delighted more to
honour than a worthy King, or an honest straightforward
Priest.</p>

<p>There <i>are</i> people who are ready to stone me, if I will not
describe Richard as being absolutely without belief in anything;
yet I really cannot oblige them, without being absolutely
untruthful. He was a spade-truth man, and he honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
used to say that he examined every religion, and picked out
its pearl to practise it. He did not scoff at them, he was
perfectly sincere and honest in what he said; nor did he
change, but he <i>grew</i>. He always <i>said</i>, and innumerable people
<i>could</i> come forward, if they had the courage&mdash;I could name
some&mdash;to say that they have heard him declare, that at the
end of all things there were only two points to stand upon&mdash;NOTHING
and CATHOLICISM; and many <i>could</i>, if they <i>would</i>,
come forward and say, that when they asked him what
religion he was, he answered Catholic.</p>

<p>He <i>never was</i>, what is called <i>here</i> and <i>now</i> in England,
an Agnostic; he was a Master-Sufi, he practised Tasáwwuf
or Sufi-ism, which combines the poetry and prose of religion,
and is mystic. The Sufi is a profound student of the different
branches of language and metaphysics, is gifted with a musical
ear, indulges in luxuriant imagery and description. They
have a simple sense&mdash;a <i>double entendre</i> understood amongst
themselves&mdash;God in Nature,&mdash;Nature in God&mdash;a mystical
affection for a Higher Life, dead to excitement, hope, fear,
etc. He was fond of quoting Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn's
motto, "It is better to restore one dead heart to Eternal Life,
than Life to a thousand dead bodies."</p>

<p>I have seen him receive gratuitous copies of an Agnostic
paper in England, and I remember one in particular&mdash;I do not
know who wrote it,&mdash;it was very long, and all the verses ended
with "Curse God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." I can
see him now reading it&mdash;and stroking his long moustache, and
muttering, "Poor devil! Vulgar beast!" He was quite
satisfied, as his friends say, that we are not gifted with the
senses to understand the origin of the Mysteries by which we
are surrounded, and in this nobody agrees more thoroughly
than I do. He likewise said he believed there was a God,
but that he could not define Him; neither can I, neither can
you, but <i>I</i> do not want to. Great minds tower above and see
into little ones, but the little minds never climb sufficiently
high to see into the Great Minds, and never did Lord
Beaconsfield say a truer thing, speaking of religion than when
he said, "<i>Sensible men never tell</i>." As I want to make this
work both valuable and interesting, I am not going into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
unknown or the unknowable, only into what he knew&mdash;what I
know; therefore I shall freely quote his early training, his
politics, his Mohammedanism, his Sufi-ism, his Brahminical
thread, his Spiritualism, and all the religions which he
studied, and nobody can give me a sensible reason why I
should leave out the Catholicism, except to point the Spanish
proverb, "that no one pelts a tree, unless it has fruit on it,"
but were I to do so, the biography would be incomplete.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a person residing inside a house, and
another person looking at the house from the opposite side
of the street; you would not be unjust enough to expect the
person on the outside to describe minutely its inner chambers
and everything that was in it, because he would have to take
it on trust from the person who resided inside, but you
<i>would</i> take the report of the man living outside as to the
<i>exterior</i> of the house. That is exactly the same as my writing
my husband's history. Do you want an edition of the inside
or an edition of the outside? If you do not want the truth,
if you order me to describe a Darwin, a Spencer, a John
Stuart Mill, I can do it; but it will not be the home-Richard,
the fireside-Richard whom <i>I</i> knew, the two perfectly distinct
Richards in one person; it will be the man as he was at
lunch, at dinner, or when friends came in, or when he dined
out, or when he paid visits; and if the world&mdash;or, let us say,
a small portion of the world,&mdash;is so unjust and silly as to
wish for untrue history, it must get somebody else to write
it. To me there are only two courses: I must either tell the
truth, and lay open the "inner life" of the man, by a faithful
photograph, or I must let it alone, and leave his friends to
misrepresent him, according to their lights.</p>

<p>It has been threatened to me that if I speak the truth
I am to reap the whirlwind, because others, who claim to
know my husband <i>well</i>, see him quite in a different light.
(I know many people intimately, but I am quite incompetent
to write their lives&mdash;I am only fit to do that for the man with
whom I lived night and day for thirty years; there are three
other people who could each write a small section of his
life, and after those nobody; I do not accept the so-called
general term "friend.") I shall be very happy indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
to answer anybody who attacks me, who is brave enough to
put his or her name; but during the two years I have been in
England I have hardly had anything but anonymous communications
and paragraphs signed under the brave names of
"Agnostic," or "One who knows," so I have no man or woman
to deal with, but empty air, which is beneath my contempt.
This is a very old game, perhaps even more ancient than
"Prophesy, O Christ, who it was that struck Thee!" but it
is cowardly and un-English&mdash;that is, if England "stands
where she did." I would also remind you of the good old
Arab proverb, that "a thousand curses never tore a shirt."</p>

<p>I would have you remember that I gain <i>nothing</i> by trying
to describe my husband as belonging to <i>any particular
religion</i>. If I would describe him as an English Agnostic&mdash;the
last new popular word&mdash;the small band of people who
call themselves his intimate friends, and who think to honour
him by injuring me, would be perfectly satisfied. I should
have all their sympathy, and my name would be at rest, both
in Society and in the Press. I have no interest to serve in
saying he was a Catholic more than anything else; I have
no bigotry on the question <i>at all</i>. If he did something
Catholic I shall say it, and if he did something Mohammedan
or Agnostic I shall equally say it.</p>

<p>It is also a curious fact, that the people who are most
vexed with me on this score, are men who, before their wives,
mothers, sisters, are good Protestants, and who go twice to the
Protestant church on Sundays, but who are quite scandalized
that my husband should be allowed a religion, and are furious
because I will not allow that Richard Burton was their
Captain. No, thank you! it is not good enough: he was
not, never <i>was</i> like <i>any</i> of you&mdash;nor can I see what it can
possibly be to you what faith, or no faith, Richard Burton
chose to die in, and why you threaten me if I speak the truth!
<i>We</i> only knew <i>two</i> things&mdash;the beautiful mysticism of the
East, which, until I lived here, I thought was Agnosticism,
and I find it is <i>not</i>; and calm, liberal-minded Roman
Catholicism. The difference between you and Richard is&mdash;you,
I mean, who admired my husband&mdash;that you are not
going anywhere,&mdash;according to your own Creed you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
nowhere to go to,&mdash;whilst <i>he</i> had a God and a continuation,
and said he would wait for me; he is only gone a long
journey, and presently I shall join him; we shall take up
where we left off, and we shall be very much happier even
than we have been here.</p>

<p>Of the thousands that have written to me since his death,
everybody writes, "What a marvellous brain your husband
had! How modest about his learning and everything concerning
himself! He was a man never understood by the
world." It is no wonder he was <i>not</i> understood by the
World; his friends hindered it, and when one who knew
him thoroughly, offers to <i>make</i> him understood, it is resented.</p>

<p>The Press has recently circulated a paragraph saying that
"I am not the fittest person to write my husband's life."
After I have finished these two volumes, it will interest me
very much to read those of the competent person, who will
be so kind as to step to the front,&mdash;with a name, please, not
anonymously,&mdash;and to learn all the things I do not know.</p>

<p>He, she, or it, will write what he said and wrote; I write
what he <i>thought</i> and <i>did</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;I must beg the reader to note, that a word often has several different
spellings, and my husband used to give them a turn all round. Indeed, I may
say that during the latter years of his life he adopted quite a different spelling,
which he judged to be correcter. In many cases it is caused by the English way
of spelling a thing, and the real native way of spelling the same. For English
Meeanee, native way Miani. The battle of Dabba (English) is spelt Dubba,
Dubbah, by the natives. Fulailee river (English) is spelt Phuleli (native). Mecca
and Medina have sometimes an <i>h</i> at the end of them. Karrachee is Karáchi.
Sind is spelt Sind, Sindh, Scind, Scinde; and what the Anglo-Indians call
Bóbagees are really Babárchis, and so on. I therefore beg that the spelling may
not be criticized. In quoting letters, I write as the author does, since I must not
change other people's spelling.&mdash;I. B.</p>

<p>Autobiographers generally begin too late.</p>

<p>Elderly gentlemen of eminence sit down to compose memories,
describe with fond minuteness babyhood, childhood, and boyhood,
and drop the pen before reaching adolescence.</p>

<p>Physiologists say that a man's body changes totally every seven
years. However that may be, I am certain that the moral man
does, and I cannot imagine anything more trying than for a man
to meet himself as he was. Conceive his entering a room, and
finding a collection of himself at the several decades. First the
puking squalling baby one year old, then the pert unpleasant schoolboy
of ten, the collegian of twenty who, like Lothair, "knows everything
and has nothing to learn." The <i>homme fait</i> of thirty in the
full warmth and heyday of life, the reasonable man of forty, who
first recognizes his ignorance and knows his own mind, of fifty with
white teeth turned dark, and dark hair turned white, whose experience
is mostly disappointment with regrets for lost time and vanished
opportunities. Sixty when the man begins to die and mourns for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
his past youth, at seventy when he <i>ought</i> to prepare for his long
journey and never does. And at all these ages he is seven different
beings not one of which he would wish to be again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Family_History"></a>Family History.</i></div>

<p>First I would make one or two notes on family history.</p>

<p>My grandfather was the Rev. Edward Burton, Rector of Tuam, in
Galway (who with his brother, eventually Bishop Burton, of Killala,
were the first of our branch to settle in Ireland). They were two of
the Burtons of Barker Hill, near Shap, Westmoreland, who own a
common ancestor with the Burtons of Yorkshire, of Carlow, and
Northamptonshire. My grandfather married Maria Margaretta
Campbell, daughter, by a Lejeune, of Dr. John Campbell, LL.D.,
Vicar-General of Tuam. Their son was my father, Lieut.-Colonel
Joseph Netterville Burton, of the 36th Regiment, who married a Miss
(Beckwith) Baker, of Nottinghamshire, a descendant, on her mother's
side, of the Scotch Macgregors. The Lejeune above mentioned was
related to the Montmorencys and Drelincourts, French Huguenots
of the time of Louis XIV. To this hangs a story which will be told
by-and-by. This Lejeune, whose real name was Louis Lejeune, is
supposed to have been a son of Louis XIV. by the Huguenot
Countess of Montmorency. He was secretly carried off to Ireland.
His name was translated to Louis Young, and he eventually became
a Doctor of Divinity. The royal, or rather morganatic, marriage
contract was asserted to have existed, but has disappeared. The
Lady Primrose of that date, who was a very remarkable personage,
and a strong ally of the Jacobites, protected him and conveyed him
to Ireland.</p>

<p>The Burtons of Shap derive themselves from the Burtons of
Longnor, like Lord Conyngham and Sir Charles Burton of Pollacton,
and the two above named were the collateral descendants of Francis
Pierpoint Burton, first Marquis of Conyngham, who gave up the
name of Burton. The notable man of the family was Sir Edward
Burton, a desperate Yorkist who was made a Knight Banneret by
Edward IV. after the second battle of St. Albans, and who added
to his arms the Cross and four roses.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Killala's son was Admiral J. Ryder Burton, who
entered the Navy in 1806. He served in the West Indies, and
off the North Coast of Spain, when in an attack on the town of
Castro, July, 1812, he received a gunshot wound in the left side,
from which the ball was never extracted. From 1813 to 1816 he
served in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, and was present at the
bombardment of Algiers, when he volunteered to command one of
the gunboats for destroying the shipping inside the Mole. His
last appointment was in May, 1820, to the command of the <i>Cornelian</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
brig, in which he proceeded in early 1824 to Algiers, where, in
company with the <i>Naiad</i> frigate, he fell in with an Algerine corvette,
the <i>Tripoli</i>, of eighteen guns and one hundred men, which, after a close
and gallant action under the batteries of the place, he boarded and
carried. This irascible veteran at his death was in receipt of a pension
for wounds. He was Rear Admiral in 1853, Vice Admiral in 1858,
and Admiral in 1863. He married, in 1822, Anna Maria, daughter
of the thirteenth Lord Dunsany; she died in 1850, leaving one son,
Francis Augustus Plunkett Burton, Colonel of the Coldstream Guards.
He married the great heiress Sarah Drax, and died in 1865, leaving
one daughter, Erulí, who married her cousin, John Plunkett, the
future Lord Dunsany.</p>

<p>My father, Joseph Netterville Burton, was a lieutenant-colonel in
the 36th Regiment. He must have been born in the latter quarter
of the eighteenth century, but he had always a superstition about
mentioning his birthday, which gave rise to a family joke that he
was born in Leap Year. Although of very mixed blood, he was
more of a Roman in appearance than anything else, of moderate
height, dark hair, sallow skin, high nose, and piercing black eyes.
He was considered a very handsome man, especially in uniform, and
attracted attention even in the street. Even when past fifty he was
considered the best-looking man at the Baths of Lucca. As handsome
men generally do, he married a plain woman, and, "Just
like Provy," the children favoured, as the saying is, the mother.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In mind he was a thorough Irishman. When he received a commission
in the army it was on condition of so many of his tenants
accompanying him. Not a few of the younger sort volunteered to
enlist, but when they joined the regiment and found that the "young
master" was all right, they at once ran away.</p>

<p>The only service that he saw was in Sicily, under Sir John Moore,
afterwards of Corunna, and there he fell in love with Italy. He was
a duellist, and shot one brother officer twice, nursing him tenderly
each time afterwards. When peace was concluded he came to
England and visited Ireland. As that did not suit him he returned
to his regiment in England. Then took place his marriage, which
was favoured by his mother-in-law and opposed by his father-in-law.
The latter, being a sharp old man of business, tied up every farthing
of his daughter's property, £30,000, and it was well that he did
so. My father, like too many of his cloth, developed a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
taste for speculation. He was a highly moral man, who would have
hated the idea of <i>rouge et noir</i>, but he gambled on the Stock
Exchange, and when railways came out he bought shares. Happily
he could not touch his wife's property, or it would speedily have
melted away; yet it was one of his grievances to the end of his life
that he could not use his wife's money to make a gigantic fortune.
He was utterly reckless where others would be more prudent.
Before his wedding tour, he passed through Windermere, and would
not call upon an aunt who was settled near the Lakes, for fear that
she might think he expected her property. She heard of it, and
left every farthing to some more dutiful nephew.</p>

<p>He never went to Ireland after his marriage, but received occasional
visits from his numerous brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The eldest of the family was the Rev. Edward Burton, who had
succeeded to the living. He wasted every farthing of his property,
and at last had the sense to migrate to Canada, where he built a
little Burtonville. In his younger days he intended to marry a girl
who preferred another man. When she was a widow with three
children, and he a widower with six children, they married, and the
result was eventually a total of about a score. Such families do
better than is supposed. The elder children are old enough to assist
the younger ones, and they seem to hang together. My father's
sisters, especially Mrs. Mathews, used to visit him when in England,
and as it was known that he had married an heiress, they all hung
to him, apparently, for themselves and their children. They managed
to get hold of all the Irish land that fell to his share, and after his
death they were incessant in their claims upon his children. My
mother was Martha Baker, one of three sister co-heiresses, and was
the second daughter. The third daughter married Robert Bagshaw,
Esq., M.P. for Harwich, and died without issue. The eldest, Sarah,
married Francis Burton, the youngest brother of my father. He
had an especial ambition to enter the Church, but circumstances
compelled him to become military surgeon in the 66th Regiment.
There was only one remarkable event in his life, which is told in a
few very interesting pages by Mrs. Ward, wife of General Ward, with
a short comment by Alfred Bate Richards, late editor of the <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>, who, together with Andrew Wilson, author of the
"Abode of Snow," who took it up at his death, compiled and put
together a short <i>résumé</i> of the principal features of my life, of which
some three hundred copies were printed, in pamphlet form and circulated
to private friends.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Facts connected with the Last Hours of Napoleon.</span></h4>


<p>"On the night of the 5th of May, 1821, a young ensign of the
66th Regiment, quartered at St. Helena, was wending his solitary
way along the path leading from the plain of Deadwood to his
barracks, situated on a patch of table-land called Francis Plain.
The road was dreary, for to the left yawned a vast chasm, the remains
of a crater, and known to the islanders as the 'Devil's Punchbowl;'
although the weather had been perfectly calm, puffs of wind occasionally
issued from the neighbouring valleys; and, at last, one of these
puffs having got into a gully, had so much ado to get out of it, that
it shrieked, and moaned, and gibbered, till it burst its bonds with a
roar like thunder&mdash;and dragging up in its wrath, on its passage to
the sea, a few shrubs, and one of those fair willows beneath which
Napoleon, first Emperor of France, had passed many a peaceful, if
not a happy, hour of repose, surrounded by his faithful friends in
exile.</p>

<p>"This occurrence, not uncommon at St. Helena, has given rise to
an idea, adopted even by Sir Walter Scott, that the soul of Napoleon
had passed to another destiny on the wings of the Storm Spirit; but,
so far from there being any tumult among the elements on that
eventful night, the gust of wind I have alluded to was only heard by
the few whose cottages dotted the green slopes of the neighbouring
mountains. But as that fair tree dropped, a whisper fell among the
islanders that Napoleon was dead! No need to dwell upon what
abler pens than mine have recorded; the eagle's wings were folded,
the dauntless eyes were closed, the last words, '<i>Tête d'armée</i>,' had
passed the faded lips, the proud heart had ceased to beat...!!</p>

<p>"They arrayed the illustrious corpse in the attire identified with
Napoleon even at the present day; and among the jewelled honours
of earth, so profusely scattered upon the breast, rested the symbol
of the faith he had professed. They shaded the magnificent brow
with the unsightly cocked hat,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and stretched down the beautiful
hands in ungraceful fashion; every one, in fact, is familiar with the
attitude I describe, as well as with a death-like cast of the imperial
head, from which a fine engraving has been taken. The cast is true
enough to Nature, but the character of the engraving is spoiled by
the addition of a laurel-wreath on the lofty but insensate brow.</p>

<p>"About this cast there is a <i>historiette</i> with which it is time the public
should become more intimately acquainted; it was the subject of
litigation, the particulars of which are detailed in the <i>Times</i> newspaper
of the 7th September, 1821, but to which I have now no
opportunity of referring. Evidence, however, was unfortunately
wanting at the necessary moment, and the complainant's case fell to
the ground. The facts are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The day after Napoleon's decease, the young officer I have alluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to, instigated by emotions which drew vast numbers to Longwood
House, found himself within the very death-chamber of Napoleon.
After the first thrill of awe had subsided, he sat down, and on the
fly-leaf torn from a book, and given him by General Bertrand, he
took a rapid but faithful sketch of the deceased Emperor. Earlier in
the day, the officer had accompanied his friend, Mr. Burton, through
certain paths in the island, in order to collect material for making a
composition resembling plaster of Paris, for the purpose of taking
the cast with as little delay after death as possible. Mr. Burton
having prepared the composition, set to work and completed the task
satisfactorily. The cast being moist, was not easy to remove; and,
at Mr. Burton's request, a tray was brought from Madame Bertrand's
apartments, Madame herself holding it to receive the precious
deposit. Mr. Ward, the ensign alluded to, impressed with the value
of such a memento, offered to take charge of it at his quarters till it
was dry enough to be removed to Mr. Burton's; Madame Bertrand,
however, pleaded so hard to have the care of it, that the two gentlemen,
both Irishmen and soldiers, yielded to her entreaties, and she
withdrew with the treasure, which she <i>never afterwards would resign</i>.</p>

<p>"There can scarcely, therefore, be a question that the casts and
engravings of Napoleon, now sold as emanating from the skill and
reverence of Antommarchi, are from the original taken by Mr. Burton.
We can only rest on circumstantial evidence, which the reader will
allow is most conclusive. It is to be regretted that Mr. Burton's cast
and that <i>supposed</i> to have been taken by Antommarchi were not <i>both</i>
demanded in evidence at the trial in 1821.</p>

<p>"The engraving I have spoken of has been Italianized by Antommarchi,
the name inscribed beneath being <i>Napoleone</i>.</p>

<p>"So completely was the daily history of Napoleon's life at St.
Helena a sealed record, that, on the arrival of papers from England,
the first question asked by the islanders and the officers of the
garrison was, 'What news of Buonaparte?' Under such circumstances
it was natural that an intense curiosity should be felt
concerning every movement of the mysterious and ill-starred exile.
Our young soldier one night fairly risked his commission for the
chance of a glimpse behind the curtain of the Longwood windows,
and, after all, saw nothing but the imperial form from the knees
downwards. Every night at sunset a <i>cordon</i> of sentries was drawn
round the Longwood plantations. Passing between the sentinels,
the venturesome youth crept, under cover of trees, to a lighted
window of the mansion. The curtains were not drawn, but the
blind was lowered. Between the latter, however, and the window-frame
were two or three inches of space; so down knelt Mr. Ward!
Some one was walking up and down the apartment, which was
brilliantly illuminated.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The footsteps drew nearer, and Mr. Ward
saw the diamond buckles of a pair of thin shoes, then two well-formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
lower limbs, encased in silk stockings; and, lastly, the edge of
a coat, lined with white silk. On a sofa at a little distance was
seated Madame Bertrand, with her boy leaning on her knee; and
some one was probably writing under Napoleon's dictation, for the
Emperor was speaking slowly and distinctly. Mr. Ward returned
to his guard-house satisfied with having <i>heard the voice of Napoleon
Buonaparte</i>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ward had an opportunity of seeing the great captive at a
distance on the very last occasion that Buonaparte breathed the
outer air. It was a bright morning when the serjeant of the guard
at Longwood Gate informed our ensign that 'General Buonaparte'
was in the garden on to which the guard-room looked. Mr. Ward
seized his spy-glass, and took a breathless survey of Napoleon, who
was standing in front of his house with one of his Generals. Something
on the ground attracted his notice; he stooped to examine
(probably a colony of ants, whose movements he watched with
interest), when the music of a band at a distance stirred the air on
Deadwood Plain; and he who had once led multitudes forth at his
slightest word now wended his melancholy way through the grounds
of Longwood, to catch a distant glimpse of a British regiment under
inspection.</p>

<p>"We have in our possession a small signal book which was used at
St. Helena during the period of Napoleon's exile. The following
passages will give some idea of the system of vigilance which it
was thought necessary to exercise, lest the world should again be
suddenly uproused by the appearance of the French Emperor on
the battle-field of Europe. It is not for me to offer any opinion on
such a system, but I take leave to say that I never yet heard any
British officer acknowledge that he would have accepted the
authority of Governor under the burden of the duties it entailed.
In a word, although every one admits the difficulties and responsibilities
of Sir Hudson Lowe's position, all deprecate the system to
which he considered himself obliged to bend.</p>

<p>"But the signal-book! Here are some of the passages which
passed from hill to valley while Napoleon took his daily ride within
the boundary prescribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'General Buonaparte has left Longwood.'</p>

<p>"'General Buonaparte has passed the guards.'</p>

<p>"'General Buonaparte is at Hutt's Gate.'</p>

<p>"'General Buonaparte is missing.'</p>

<p>"The latter paragraph resulted from General Buonaparte having,
in the course of his ride, turned an angle of a hill, or descended
some valley beyond the ken, for a few minutes, of the men working
the telegraphs on the hills!</p>

<p>"It was not permitted that the once Emperor of France should
be designated by any other title than '<i>General</i> Buonaparte;' and,
alas! innumerable were the squabbles that arose between the
Governor and his captive, because the British Ministry had made
this puerile order peremptory. I have now no hesitation in making
known the great Duke's opinion on this subject, which was transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to me two years ago, by one who for some months every year
held daily intercourse with his Grace, but who could not, while the
Duke was living, permit me to publish what had been expressed in
private conversation.</p>

<p>"'I would have taken care that he did not escape from St.
Helena,' said Wellington: 'but he might have been addressed by
any name he pleased.'</p>

<p>"I cannot close this paper without saying a word or two on the
condition of the buildings once occupied by the most illustrious and
most unfortunate of exiles.</p>

<p>"It is well known that Napoleon never would inhabit the house
which was latterly erected at Longwood for his reception; that, he
said, 'would serve for his tomb;' and that the slabs from the kitchen
<i>did</i> actually form part of the vault in which he was placed in his
favourite valley beneath the willows, and near the fountain whose
crystal waters had so often refreshed him.</p>

<p>"This abode, therefore, is not invested with the same interest as
his real residence, well named the 'Old House at Longwood;' for
a more crazy, wretched, filthy barn, it would scarcely be possible to
meet with; and many painful emotions have filled my heart during
nearly a four years' sojourn on 'The Rock,' as I have seen French
soldiers and sailors march gravely and decorously to the spot,
hallowed in their eyes, of course, by its associations with their invisible
but unforgotten idol, and degraded, it must be admitted, by
the change it has undergone.</p>

<p>"Indeed, few French persons can be brought to believe that it
ever was a decent abode; and no one can deny that it must outrage
the feelings of a people like the French, so especially affected by
associations, to see the bedchamber of their former Emperor a dirty
stable, and the room in which he breathed his last sigh, appropriated
to the purpose of winnowing and thrashing wheat! In the last-named
room are two pathetic mementoes of affection. When
Napoleon's remains were exhumed in 1846, Counts Bertrand and
Las Casas carried off with them, the former a piece of the boarded
floor on which the Emperor's bed had rested, the latter a stone from
the wall pressed by the pillow of his dying Chief.</p>

<p>"Would that I had the influence to recommend to the British
Government, that these ruined and, I must add, desecrated, buildings
should be razed to the ground; and that on their site should be
erected a convalescent hospital for the sick of all ranks, of <i>both</i>
services, and of <i>both</i> nations. Were the British and French Governments
to unite in this plan, how grand a sight would it be to behold
the two nations shaking hands, so to speak, over the grave of
Napoleon!</p>

<p>"On offering this suggestion, when in Paris lately, to one of the
nephews of the first Emperor Napoleon, the Prince replied that
'the idea was nobly philanthropic, but that England would never
listen to it.' I must add that his Highness said this 'rather in
sorrow than in anger;' then, addressing Count L&mdash;&mdash;, one of the
faithful followers of Napoleon in exile, and asking him which mausoleum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<i>he</i> preferred,&mdash;the one in which we then stood, the dome of
the <i>Invalides</i>, or the rock of St. Helena,&mdash;he answered, to my surprise,
'St. Helena; for no grander monument than that can ever be
raised to the Emperor!'</p>

<p>"Circumstances made one little incident connected with this, our
visit to the <i>Invalides</i>, most deeply interesting. Comte D'Orsay was
of the party; indeed it was in his elegant <i>atélier</i> we had all assembled,
ere starting, to survey the mausoleum then being prepared
for the ashes of Napoleon. Suffering and debilitated as Comte
D'Orsay was, precious, as critiques on art, were the words that fell
from his lips during our progress through the work-rooms, as we
stopped before the sculptures intended to adorn the vault wherein
the sarcophagus is to rest. Ere leaving the works, the Director, in
exhibiting the solidity of the granite which was finally to encase
Napoleon, struck fire with a mallet from the magnificent block.
'See,' said Comte D'Orsay, 'though the dome of the <i>Invalides</i> may
fall, France may yet light a torch at the tomb of her Emperor.' I
cannot remember the exact words, but such was their import. Comte
D'Orsay died a few weeks after this.</p>

<p>"Since the foregoing was written, members of the Burton family
have told me, that, after taking the cast, Mr. Burton went to his
regimental rounds, leaving the mask on the tray to dry; the back of
the head was left on to await his return, not being dry enough to
take off, and was thus overlooked by Madame Bertrand. When he
returned he found that the mask was packed up and sent on board
ship for France in Antommarchi's name. From a feeling of deep
mortification he took the back part of the cast, reverently scraped
off the hair now enclosed in a ring, and, overcome by his feelings,
dashed it into a thousand pieces. He was afterwards offered by
Messrs. Gall and Spurzheim (phrenologists), one thousand pounds
sterling for that portion of the cast which was wanting to the cast
so called Antommarchi's. Amongst family private papers there was
a correspondence, read by most members of it, between Antommarchi
and Mr. Burton, in which Antommarchi stated that he knew
Burton had made the plaster and taken the cast. Mrs. Burton,
after the death of her husband and Antommarchi, thought the
correspondence useless and burnt it; but the hair was preserved
under a glass watch-case in the family for forty years. There was
an offer made about the year 1827 or 1828 by persons high in
position in France who knew the truth to have the matter cleared
up, but Mr. Burton was dying at the time, and was unable to take
any part in it, so the affair dropped.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Bust of Buonaparte</span>.</h4>

<h5>"<i>Extract from the 'New Times' of September</i> 7<i>th,</i> 1821.</h5>


<p>"On Wednesday a case of a very singular nature occurred at the
Bow Street Office.</p>

<p>"Count Bertrand, the companion of Buonaparte in his exile at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
St. Helena (and the executor under his will), appeared before Richard
Birnie, Esq., accompanied by Sir Robert Wilson, in consequence of
a warrant having been issued to search the residence of the Count
for a bust of his illustrious master, which, it was alleged, was the
property of Mr. Burton, 66th Regiment, when at St. Helena.</p>

<p>"The following are the circumstances of the case:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Previous to the death of Buonaparte, he had given directions to
his executors that his body should not be touched by any person
after his death; however, Count Bertrand directed Dr. Antommarchi
to take a bust of him; but not being able to find a material which
he thought would answer the purpose, he mentioned the circumstances
to Mr. Burton, who promised that he would procure some if
possible.</p>

<p>"The Englishman, in pursuance of this promise, took a boat and
picked up raw materials on the island, some distance from Longwood.
He made a plaster, which he conceived would answer this purpose.
When he showed it to Dr. Antommarchi he said it would not answer,
and refused to have anything to do with it, in consequence of which
Mr. Burton proceeded to take a bust himself, with the sanction of
Madame Bertrand, who was in the room at the time. An agreement
was entered into that copies should be made of the bust, and that
Messieurs Burton and Antommarchi were to have each a copy.</p>

<p>"It was found, however, that the plaster was not sufficiently durable
for the purpose, and it was proposed to send the original to England
to have copies taken.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Burton, however, afterwards inquired for the bust, he
was informed that it was packed and nailed up; but a promise was
made, that upon its arrival in Europe, an application should be
made to the family of Buonaparte for the copy required by Mr.
Burton.</p>

<p>"On its arrival, Mr. Burton wrote to the Count to have his promised
copy, but he was told, as before, that application would be made to
the family of Buonaparte for it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burton upon this applied to Bow Street for a search warrant
in order to obtain the bust, as he conceived he had a right to it, he
having furnished the materials and executed it.</p>

<p>"A warrant was issued, and Taunton and Salmon, two officers,
went to the Count's residence in Leicester Square. When they
arrived, and made known their errand, they were remonstrated with
by Sir Robert Wilson and the Count, who begged they would not act
till they had an interview with Mr. Birnie, as there must be some
mistake. The officers politely acceded to the request, and waived
their right of search.</p>

<p>"Count Bertrand had, it seems, offered a pecuniary compensation
to Mr. Burton for his trouble, but it was <i>indignantly refused by that
officer</i>, who persisted in the assertion of his right to the bust as his
own property, and made application for the search warrant.</p>

<p>"Count Bertrand, in answer to the case stated by Mr. Burton, said
that the bust was the property of the family of the deceased, to
whom he was executor, and he thought he should not be authorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in giving it up. If, however, the law of this country ordained it
otherwise, he must submit; but he should protest earnestly against it.</p>

<p>"The worthy magistrate, having sworn the Count to the fact that
he was executor under the will of Buonaparte, observed that it was
a case out of his jurisdiction altogether, and if Mr. Burton chose
to persist in his claim, he must seek a remedy before another
tribunal.</p>

<p>"The case was dismissed, and the warrant was cancelled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The sequel to the Buonaparte story is short; Captain Burton (in
1861) thinking that the sketch, which was perfect, and the lock of
hair which had been preserved in a family watch-case for forty years,
would be great treasures to the Buonapartes, and should be given to
them, begged the sketch of General and Mrs. Ward, and the hair
from the Burtons; he had the hair set in a handsome ring, with a
wreath of laurels and the Buonaparte bees. His wife had a complete
set of her husband's works very handsomely bound, as a gift, and in
January, 1862, Captain Burton sent his wife over to Paris, with the
sketch, the ring, and the books, to request an audience with the
Emperor and Empress, and offer them these things, simply as an act
of civility&mdash;for Captain and Mrs. Burton in opinion and feeling were
Legitimists. Captain Burton was away on a journey, and Mrs. Burton
had to go alone. She was young and inexperienced, and had not a
single friend in Paris to advise her. She left her letter and presents
at the Tuileries. The audience was not granted. His Imperial
Majesty declined the presents, and she never heard anything more
of them. They were not returned. Frightened and disappointed at
the failure of this, her first little mission at the outset of her married
life, she returned to London directly, where she found the Burton
family anything but pleased at her failure and her want of <i>savoir
faire</i> in the matter, having unwittingly caused their treasure to be
utterly unappreciated. She said to me on her return, 'I never felt so
snubbed in my life, and I shall never like Paris again;' and I believe
she has kept her word.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Oxonian</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Francis Burton, alluded to in these pages, returned to England
after the death of Napoleon, married one of the three co-heiress
(Baker) sisters, and died early, leaving only two daughters. One
died, and the other, Sarah, became Mrs. Pryce-Harrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Louis_XIVth_Romance"></a>The Louis XIVth Romance.</i></div>

<p>Nor was this the only little romance in our Burton family, as the
following story taken from family documents tends to show. Here
is the Louis XIV. history&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With regard to Louis XIV. there are one or two curious and
interesting legends in the Burton family, well authenticated, which
make Richard Burton great-great-great-grandson of Louis XIV. of
France, by a morganatic marriage; and another which would entitle
him to an English baronetcy, dating from 1622.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"One of the documents in the family is entitled, 'A Pedigree of
the Young family, showing their descent from Louis XIV. of France,'
and which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Louis XIV. of France took the beautiful Countess of Montmorency
from her husband and shut him up in a fortress. After
the death of (her husband) the Constable de Montmorency, Louis
morganatically <i>married</i> the Countess. She had a son called Louis le
Jeune, who 'was brought over to Ireland by Lady Primrose,' then a
widow. This Lady Primrose's maiden name was Drelincourt, and
the baby was named Drelincourt after his godfather and guardian,
Dean Drelincourt (of Armagh), who was the father of Lady Primrose.
He grew up, was educated at Armagh, and was known as Drelincourt
Young. He married a daughter of Dean Drelincourt, and became
the father of Hercules Drelincourt Young, and also of Miss (Sarah)
Young, who married Dr. John Campbell, LL.D., Vicar-General of
Tuam (<i>ob</i>. 1772). Sarah Young's brother, the above-mentioned
Hercules Young, married and had a son George, a merchant in
Dublin, who had some French deeds and various documents, which
proved his right to property in France.</p>

<p>"The above-named Dr. John Campbell, by his marriage with Miss
Sarah Young (rightly Lejeune, for they had changed the name from
French to English), had a daughter, Maria Margaretta Campbell,
who was Richard Burton's grandmother. The same Dr. John
Campbell was a member of the Argyll family, and a first cousin of
the 'three beautiful Gunnings,' and was Richard Burton's great-grandfather.</p>

<p>"These papers (for there are other documents) affect a host of
families in Ireland&mdash;the Campbells, Nettervilles, Droughts, Graves,
Burtons, Plunketts, Trimlestons, and many more.</p>

<p>"In 1875 <i>Notes and Queries</i> was full of this question and the
various documents, but it has never been settled.</p>

<p>"The genealogy runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Louis XIV.</p>

<p>"<i>Son</i>, Louis le Jeune (known as Louis Drelincourt Young), by
Countess Montmorency; adopted by Lady Primrose<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (see Earl of
Rosebery), and subsequently married to a daughter of Drelincourt,
Dean of Armagh.</p>

<p>"<i>Daughter</i>, Sarah Young; married to Dr. John Campbell, LL.D.,
Vicar-General of Tuam, Galway.</p>

<p>"<i>Daughter</i>, Maria Margaretta Campbell; married to the Rev.
Edward Burton, Rector of Tuam, Galway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Son</i>, Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Netterville Burton, 36th Regiment.</p>

<p>"<i>Son</i>, Richard Burton, whose biography I am now relating.</p>

<p>"There was a Lady Primrose buried in the Rosebery vaults, by
her express will, with a little casket in her hands, containing some
secret, which was to die with her; many think that it might contain
the missing link.</p>

<p>"The wife of Richard Burton received, in 1875, two very tantalizing
anonymous letters, which she published in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, but
which she has never been able to turn to account, through the writer
declining to come forward, <i>even secretly</i>.</p>

<p>"One ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;There is an old baronetcy in the Burton family to
which you belong, dating from the reign of Edw. III.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;I rather
believe <i>now in abeyance</i>&mdash;which it was thought Admiral Ryder
Burton would have taken up, and which after his death can be taken
up by your branch of the family. All particulars you will find by
searching the Heralds' Office; but I am positive my information is
correct.&mdash;From one who read your letter in <i>N. and Q</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>"She shortly after received and published the second anonymous
letter; but, though she made several appeals to the writer in <i>Notes
and Queries</i>, no answer was obtained, and Admiral Ryder Burton
eventually died.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;I cannot help thinking that if you were to have the
records of the Burton family searched carefully at Shap, in Westmoreland,
you would be able to fill up the link wanting in your
husband's descent, from 1712 to 1750, or thereabouts. As I am
<i>quite positive</i> of a baronetcy <i>being in abeyance</i> in the Burton family,
and that <i>an old one</i>, it would be worth your while getting all the
information you can from Shap and Tuam&mdash;the Rev. Edward
Burton, Dean of Killala and Rector of Tuam, whose niece he
married was a Miss Ryder, of the Earl of Harrowby's family, by
whom he had no children. His second wife, a Miss Judge, was a
descendant of the Otways, of Castle Otway, and connected with
many leading families in Ireland. Admiral James Ryder Burton
could, if he <i>would</i>, supply you with information respecting the missing
link in your husband's descent. I have always heard that <i>de Burton</i>
was the proper family name, and I saw lately that a <i>de Burton</i> now
lives in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>"'Hoping, madam, that you will be able to establish your claim
to the baronetcy,</p>

<p>"'I remain, yours truly,</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">A Reader of</span> <i>N. and Q</i>.</p>

<p>"'P.S.&mdash;I rather think also, and advise your ascertaining the <i>fact</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that the estate of Barker Hill, Shap, Westmoreland, by the law of
<i>entail</i>, will devolve, at the death of Admiral Ryder Burton, on your
husband, Captain Richard Burton.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"From the Royal College of Heralds, however, the following information
was forwarded to Mrs. Richard Burton:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There <i>was</i> a baronetcy in the family of Burton. The first was
Sir Thomas Burton, Knight, of Stokestone, Leicestershire; created
July 22nd, 1622, a baronet, by King James I. Sir Charles was the
last baronet. He appears to have been in great distress&mdash;a prisoner
for debt, 1712. He is supposed to have died without issue, when
the title became extinct&mdash;at least nobody has claimed it since. If
your husband can prove his descent from a younger son of any of
the baronets, he would have a right to the title. The few years
must be filled up between 1712 and the birth of your husband's
grandfather, which was about 1750; and you must prove that the
Rev. Edward Burton, Rector of Tuam in Galway, your husband's
grandfather (who came from Shap, in Westmoreland, with his brother,
Bishop Burton, of Tuam), was descended from any of the sons of
any of the baronets named.'"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<h4>RICHARD'S BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_Burtons_Early_Life"></a>Richard Burton's Early Life.</i></div>

<p>I was born at 9.30 p.m., 19th March (Feast of St. Joseph in the
calendar), 1821, at Barham House, Herts, and suppose I was
baptized in due course at the parish church. My birth took place
in the same year as, but the day before, the grand event of George
IV. visiting the Opera for the first time after the Coronation, March
20th. I was the eldest of three children. The second was Maria
Catherine Eliza, who married Henry, afterwards General Sir Henry
Stisted, a very distinguished officer, who died, leaving only two
daughters, one of whom, Georgina Martha, survives. Third, Edward
Joseph Netterville, late Captain in the 37th Regiment, unmarried.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember, and it is always interesting to record
a child's first memories, was being brought down after dinner at
Barham House to eat white currants, seated upon the knee of a tall
man with yellow hair and blue eyes; but whether the memory is
composed of a miniature of my grandfather, and whether the white
frock and blue sash with bows come from a miniature of myself and
not from life, I can never make up my mind.</p>

<p>Barham House was a country place bought by my grandfather,
Richard Baker, who determined to make me his heir because I had
red hair, an unusual thing in the Burton family. The hair soon
changed to black, which seems to justify the following remarks by
Alfred Bate Richards in the pamphlet alluded to. They are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Richard Burton's talents for mixing with and assimilating natives
of all countries, but especially Oriental characters, and of becoming
as one of themselves without any one doubting or suspecting his
origin; his perfect knowledge of their languages, manners, customs,
habits, and religion; and last, but not least, his being gifted by
nature with an Arab head and face, favoured this his first enterprise"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
(the pilgrimage to Mecca). "One can learn from that versatile poet-traveller,
the excellent Théophile Gautier, why Richard Burton is an
Arab in appearance; and account for that incurable restlessness that
is unable to wrest from fortune a spot on earth wherein to repose
when weary of wandering like the desert sands.</p>

<p>"'There is a reason,' says Gautier, who had studied the Andalusian
and the Moor, 'for the fantasy of nature which causes an Arab to
be born in Paris, or a Greek in Auvergne; the mysterious voice of
blood which is silent for generations, or only utters a confused
murmur, speaks at rare intervals a more intelligible language. In
the general confusion race claims its own, and some forgotten
ancestor asserts his rights. Who knows what alien drops are
mingled with our blood? The great migrations from the table-lands
of India, the descents of the Northern races, the Roman and Arab
invasions, have all left their marks. Instincts which seem <i>bizarre</i>
spring from these confused recollections, these hints of distant
country. The vague desire of this primitive Fatherland moves such
minds as retain the more vivid memories of the past. Hence the
wild unrest that wakens in certain spirits the need of flight, such as
the cranes and the swallows feel when kept in bondage&mdash;the
impulses that make a man leave his luxurious life to bury himself
in the Steppes, the Desert, the Pampas, the Sahara. He goes to
seek his brothers. It would be easy to point out the intellectual
Fatherland of our greatest minds. Lamartine, De Musset, and De
Vigny are English; Delacroix is an Anglo-Indian; Victor Hugo a
Spaniard; Ingres belongs to the Italy of Florence and Rome.'</p>

<p>"Richard Burton has also some peculiarities which oblige one to
suspect a drop of Oriental, perhaps gipsy, blood. By gipsy we
must understand the pure Eastern."</p></blockquote>

<p>My mother had a wild half-brother&mdash;Richard Baker, junior, a
barrister-at-law, who refused a judgeship in Australia, and died a
soap-boiler. To him she was madly attached, and delayed the
signing of my grandfather's will as much as possible to the prejudice
of her own babe. My grandfather Baker drove in his carriage to see
Messrs. Dendy, his lawyers, with the object of signing the will, and
dropped dead, on getting out of the carriage, of ossification of the
heart; and, the document being unsigned, the property was
divided. It would now be worth half a million of money.</p>

<p>When I was sent out to India as a cadet, in 1842, I ran down to
see the old house for the last time, and started off in a sailing ship
round the Cape for Bombay, in a frame of mind to lead any forlorn
hope wherever it might be. Warren Hastings, Governor-General
of India, under similar circumstances threw himself under a tree,
and formed the fine resolution to come back and buy the old place;
but <i>he</i> belonged to the eighteenth century. The nineteenth is far
more cosmopolitan. I always acted upon the saying, <i>Omne solum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<i>forti patria</i>, or, as I translated it, "For every region is a strong
man's home."</p>

<p>Meantime my father had been obliged to go on half-pay by the
Duke of Wellington for having refused to appear as a witness against
Queen Caroline. He had been town mayor at Genoa when she
lived there, and her kindness to the officers had greatly prepossessed
them in her favour; so, when ordered by the War Office to turn
Judas, he flatly refused. A great loss to himself, as Lord William
Bentinck, Governor-General of India, was about to take him as aide-de-camp,
and to his family, as he lost all connection with the army,
and lived entirely abroad, and, eventually coming back, died with
his wife at Bath in 1857. However, he behaved like a gentleman,
and none of his family ever murmured at the step, though I began
life as an East Indian cadet, and my brother in a marching regiment,
whilst our cousins were in the Guards and the Rifles and other crack
corps of the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="At_Tours"></a>At Tours.</i></div>

<p>The family went abroad when I was a few months old, and settled
at Tours, the charming capital of Touraine, which then contained
some two hundred English families (now reduced to a score or so),
attracted by the beauty of the place, the healthy climate, the economy
of living, the facilities of education, and the friendly feeling of the
French inhabitants, who, despite Waterloo, associated freely with the
strangers.</p>

<p>They had a chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Way (whose son afterwards
entered the Indian army; I met him in India, and he died young);
their schoolmaster was Mr. Clough, who bolted from his debts, and
then Mr. Gilchrist, who, like the Rev. Edward Irving, Carlisle's
friend (whom the butcher once asked if he couldn't assist him), caned
his pupils to the utmost. The celebrated Dr. Brettoneau took
charge of the invalids. They had their duellist, the Honourable
Martin Hawke, their hounds that hunted the Forest of Amboise, and
a select colony of Irishmen, Messrs. Hume and others, who added
immensely to the fun and frolic of the place.</p>

<p>At that period a host of these little colonies were scattered over
the Continent nearest England; in fact, an oasis of Anglo-Saxondom
in a desert of continentalism, somewhat like the society of English
country towns as it was in 1800, not as it is now, where society is
confined to the parson, dentist, surgeon, general practitioners, the
bankers, and the lawyers. And in those days it had this advantage,
that there were no snobs, and one seldom noticed the <i>aigre discorde</i>,
the <i>maladie chronique des ménages bourgeoises</i>. Knowing nothing of
Mrs. Grundy, the difference of the foreign colonies was that the
<i>weight</i> of English respectability appeared to be taken off them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
though their lives were respectable and respected. The Mrs. Gamps
and Mrs. Grundys were not so rampant. The English of these little
colonies were intensely patriotic, and cared comparatively little for
party politics. They stuck to their own Church because it <i>was</i> their
Church, and they knew as much about the Catholics at their very
door, as the average Englishman does of the Hindú. Moreover, they
honestly called themselves Protestants in those days, and the French
called themselves Catholics. There was no quibble about "their
being Anglo-Catholics, and the others Roman-Catholics." They subscribed
liberally to the Church, and did not disdain to act as churchwardens.
They kept a sharp look-out upon the parson, and one
of your Modern High Church Protestants or Puseyites or Ritualists
would have got the sack after the first sermon. They were intensely
national. Any Englishman in those days who refused to fight a duel
with a Frenchman was sent to Coventry, and bullied out of the
place. English girls who flirted with foreigners, were looked upon
very much as white women who permit the addresses of a nigger, are
looked upon by those English who have lived in black countries.
White women who do these things lose caste. Beauséjour, the
château taken by the family, was inhabited by the Maréchale de
Menon in 1778, and eventually became the property of her <i>homme
d'affaires</i>, Monsieur Froguet. The dear old place stands on the
right bank of the Loire, halfway up the heights that bound the
stream, commanding a splendid view, and fronted by a French
garden and vineyards now uprooted. In 1875 I paid it a last visit,
and found a friend from Brazil, a Madame Izarié, widow of my friend
the French Consul of Bahía, who had come to die in the house of
his sister, Madame Froguet.</p>

<p>Tours was in those days (1820-30) the most mediæval City in
France. The western half of the city, divided from the eastern by
the Rue Royale, contained a number of old turreted houses of freestone,
which might have belonged to the fifteenth century. There
also was the tomb of the Venerable St. Martin in a crypt, where
lamps are ever burning, and where the destroyed cathedral has not
yet been rebuilt. The eastern city contained the grand Cathedral of
St. Garcien, with its domed towers, and the Archévêché or Archbishop's
palace with beautiful gardens. Both are still kept in the
best order. In forty-five years the city has grown enormously. The
southern suburbs, where the Mall and Ramparts used to be, has
become Boulevards Heurteloup and Béranger; and "Places," such
as that of the Palais de Justice, where cabbage gardens fenced with
paling and thorn hedges once showed a few pauper cottages
defended by the fortifications, are now Crescents and Kiosks for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
loungers, houses with tall mansarde roofs, and the large railway
station that connects Tours with the outer world. The river, once
crossed by a single long stone bridge, has now two suspension
bridges and a railway bridge, and the river-holms, formerly strips of
sand, are now grown to double their size, covered with trees and
defended by stone dykes.</p>

<p>I remember passing over the river on foot when it was frozen, but
with the increased population that no longer happens. Still there
are vestiges of the old establishments. The Boule d'Or with its
Golden Ball, and the Pheasant Hotel, both in the Rue Royale, still
remain. You still read, "Maison Piernadine recommended for <i>is</i>
elegance, <i>is</i> good taste, <i>is</i> new fashions of the first choice." Madame
Fisterre, the maker of admirable apple-puffs, has disappeared and has
left no sign. This was, as may be supposed, one of my first childish
visits. We young ones enjoyed ourselves very much at the Château
de Beauséjour, eating grapes in the garden, putting our Noah's ark
animals under the box hedges, picking snail-shells and cowslips in
the lanes, playing with the dogs&mdash;three black pointers of splendid
breed, much admired by the Duke of Cumberland when he afterwards
saw them in Richmond Park, named Juno, Jupiter, and
Ponto. Charlotte Ling, the old nurse, daughter of the lodge-keeper
at Barham House, could not stand the absence of beef and beer
and the presence of kickshaws and dandelion salad, and after Aunt
Georgina Baker had paid us a visit, she returned with her to Old
England. A favourite amusement of us children was swarming up
the tails of our father's horses, three in number, and one&mdash;a horse
of Mecklenburg breed&mdash;was as tame as an Arab. The first story
Aunt Georgina used to tell of me was of my lying on my back in
a broiling sun, and exclaiming, "How I love a bright burning sun!"
(Nature speaking in early years). Occasional drawbacks were
violent storms of thunder and lightning, when we children were
hustled out of our little cots under the roof, and taken to the
drawing-room, lest the lightning should strike us, and the daily
necessity of learning the alphabet and so forth, multiplication table,
and our prayers.</p>

<p>I was intended for that wretched being, the infant phenomenon,
and so began Latin at three and Greek at four. Things are better
now. Our father used to go out wild-boar hunting in the <i>Forêt
d'Amboise</i>, where is the château in which Abd-el-Kadir was imprisoned
by the French Government from 1847 to 1852, when he
was set free by Napoleon III., at the entreaties of Lord Londonderry.
(It is said that his Majesty entered his prison in person and
set him free. Abd-el-Kadir, at Damascus, often expressed his obligations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to the English, and warmly welcomed any English face. On
one occasion I took a near relation of Lord Londonderry's to see
him, and he was quite overcome.) My father was periodically
brought home hurt by running against a tree. Sport was so much
in vogue then as to come between the parson and his sermon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_First_School"></a>His First School.</i></div>

<p>This pleasant life came to a close one day. We were three: I
was six, Maria four, and Edward three. One morning saw the
hateful school-books fastened with a little strap, and we boys and
our little bundle were conveyed in a small carriage to the town,
where we were introduced into a room with a number of English
and French boys, who were sitting opposite hacked and ink-spotted
desks, looking as demure as they could, though every now and then
they broke out into wicked grins and nudges. A lame Irish schoolmaster
(Clough) smiled most graciously at us as long as our father
was in the room, but was not half so pleasant when we were left
alone. We wondered "what we were doing in that <i>Galère</i>," especially
as we were sent there day after day, and presently we learnt the
dread truth that we were at school at the ripe ages of six and three.
Presently it was found that the house was at an inconvenient distance
from school, and the family transferred itself to the Rue de
l'Archévêché, a very nice house in the north-eastern corner of what
is still the best street in the town (Rue Royale being mostly commercial).
It is close to the Place and the Archbishop's palace,
which delighted us, with small deer feeding about the dwarf lawn.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Clough ran away, leaving his sister to follow as
best she could, and we were transferred to the care of Mr. John
Gilchrist, a Scotch pedagogue of the old brutal school, who took an
especial delight in caning the boys, especially with a rattan or ferula
across the palm of the hand; but we were not long in discovering a
remedy, by splitting the end of the cane and inserting a bit of hair.
We took lessons in drawing, dancing, French, and music, in which
each child showed its individuality. Maria loved all four; Edward
took to French and music and hated drawing; I took to French and
drawing, and hated music and dancing. My brother and I took to
the study of Arms, by nature, as soon as we could walk, at first with
popguns and spring pistols and tin and wooden sabres, and I can
quite well remember longing to kill the porter at five years old,
because he laughed at our <i>sabres de bois</i> and <i>pistolets de paille</i>.</p>

<p>I was a boy of three ideas. Usually if a child is forbidden to eat
the sugar or to lap up the cream he simply either obeys or does the
contrary; but I used to place myself before the sugar and cream
and carefully study the question, "Have I the courage not to touch
them?" When I was quite sure of myself that I had the courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
I instantly rewarded resolution by emptying one or both. Moreover,
like most boys of strong imagination and acute feeling, I was
a resolute and unblushing liar; I used to ridicule the idea of my
honour being any way attached to telling the truth, I considered it
an impertinence the being questioned, I never could understand
what moral turpitude there could be in a lie, <i>unless it was told for
fear of the consequences</i> of telling the truth, or one that would attach
blame to another person. That feeling continued for many a year,
and at last, as very often happens, as soon as I realized that a lie
was contemptible, it ran into quite the other extreme, a disagreeable
habit of scrupulously telling the truth whether it was timely or not.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The school was mostly manned by English boys, sprinkled with
French, and the mixture of the two formed an ungodly article, and
the Italian proverb&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Un Inglese Italianato</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">È un Diavolo incarnato"</span><br />
</p>

<p>may be applied with quite as much truth to English boys brought
up in France. To succeed in English life, boys must be brought up
in a particular groove. First the preparatory school, then Eton and
Oxford, with an occasional excursion to France, Italy, and Germany,
to learn languages, not of Stratford-atte-Bowe, and to find out that
England is not the whole world. I never met any of my Tours
schoolfellows save one&mdash;Blayden Edward Hawke, who became a
Commander in the Navy, and died in 1877.</p>

<p>We boys became perfect devilets, and played every kind of trick
despite the rattan. Fighting the French gutter-boys with sticks and
stones, fists, and snowballs was a favourite amusement, and many a
donkey-lad went home with ensanguined nose, whilst occasionally
we got the worst of it from some big brother. The next favourite
game was playing truant, passing the day in utter happiness, fancying
ourselves Robinson Crusoes, and wandering about the strip of wood
(long since doomed to fuel) at the top of the Tranchée. Our father
and mother went much into the society of the place, which was gay
and pleasant, and we children were left more or less to the servants.
We boys beat all our bonnes, generally by running at their petticoats
and upsetting them. There was one particular case when a new
nurse arrived, a huge Norman girl, who at first imposed upon this
turbulent nursery by her breadth of shoulder and the general rigour
of her presence. One unlucky day we walked to the Faubourg at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the south-east of the town, the only part of old Tours now remaining;
the old women sat spinning and knitting at their cottage doors, and
remarked loud enough for us boys to hear, "Ah ça! ces petits
gamins! Voilà une honnête bonne qui ne leur laissera pas faire
des farces!" Whereupon Euphrosyne became as proud as a peacock,
and insisted upon a stricter discipline than we were used to. That
forest walk ended badly. A jerk of the arm on her part brought on
a general attack from the brood; the poor bonne measured her length
upon the ground, and we jumped upon her. The party returned,
she with red eyes, torn cap, and downcast looks, and we hooting
and jeering loudly, and calling the old women "Les Mères Pomponnes,"
who screamed predictions that we should come to the
guillotine.</p>

<p>Our father and mother had not much idea of managing their
children; it was like the old tale of the hen who hatched ducklings.
By way of a wholesome and moral lesson of self-command and self-denial,
our mother took us past Madame Fisterre's windows, and
bade us look at all the good things in the window, during which we
fixed our ardent affections upon a tray of apple-puffs; then she said,
"Now, my dears, let us go away; it is so good for little children to
restrain themselves." Upon this we three devilets turned flashing
eyes and burning cheeks upon our moralizing mother, broke the
windows with our fists, clawed out the tray of apple-puffs, and
bolted, leaving poor mother a sadder and a wiser woman, to pay the
damages of her lawless brood's proceedings.</p>

<p>Talking of the guillotine, the schoolmaster unwisely allowed the
boys, by way of a school-treat, to see the execution of a woman who
killed her small family by poisoning, on condition that they would
look away when the knife descended; but of course that was just
the time (with such an injunction) when every small neck was craned
and eyes strained to look, and the result was that the whole school
played at guillotine for a week, happily without serious accidents.<a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Trips"></a>Trips.</i></div>

<p>The residence at Tours was interrupted by occasional trips, summering
in other places, especially at St. Malo. The seaport then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
thoroughly deserved the slighting notice, to which it was subjected
by Captain Marryat, and the house in the Faubourg was long remembered
from its tall avenue of old yew trees, which afforded
abundant bird's-nesting. At Dieppe the gallops on the sands were
very much enjoyed, for we were put on horseback as soon as we
could straddle. Many a fall was of course the result, and not a
few broken heads, whilst the rival French boys were painfully
impressed by the dignity of spurs and horsewhips.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Grandmamma_Baker"></a>Grandmamma Baker.</i></div>

<p>At times relations came over to visit us, especially Grandmamma
Baker (Grandmamma Baker was a very peculiar character). Her
arrival was a signal for presents and used to be greeted with
tremendous shouts of delight, but the end of a week always
brought on a quarrel. Our mother was rather thin and delicate,
but our grandmother was a thorough old Macgregor, of the Helen
or the Rob Roy type, and was as quick to resent an affront as any
of her clan. Her miniature shows that she was an extremely handsome
woman, who retained her good looks to the last. When her
stepson, Richard Baker, jun., inherited his money, £80,000, he
went to Paris and fell into the hands of the celebrated Baron de
Thierry. This French friend persuaded him to embark in the
pleasant little speculation of building a bazaar. By the time the
walls began to grow above ground the Englishman had finished
£60,000, and, seeing that a million would hardly finish the work,
he sold off his four greys and fled Paris post-haste in a post-chaise.
The Baron Thierry followed him to London, and, bold as brass,
presented himself as an injured creditor at grandmamma's pretty
little house in Park Lane. The old lady replied by summoning
her servants and having him literally kicked downstairs in true
Highland fashion. That Baron's end is well known in history.
He made himself king of one of the Cannibal Islands in the
South Sea, and ended by being eaten by his ungrateful subjects.</p>

<p>Grandmamma Baker was determined to learn French, and,
accordingly, secured a professor. The children's great delight
was to ambuscade themselves, and to listen with joy to the lessons.
"What is the sun?" "Le soleil, madame!" "La solelle." "Non,
madame. Le so&mdash;leil." "Oh, pooh! La solelle." After about six
repetitions of the same, roars of laughter issued from the curtains&mdash;we
of course speaking French like English, upon which the old lady
would jump up and catch hold of the nearest delinquent and administer
condign punishment. She had a peculiar knack of starting
the offender, compelling him to describe a circle of which she was the
centre, whilst, holding with the left hand, she administered smacks
and cuffs with the right; but, as every mode of attack has its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
defence, it was soon found out that the proper corrective was to throw
one's self on one's back, and give vigorous kicks with both legs. It
need hardly be said that Grandmamma predicted that Jack Ketch
would make acquaintance with the younger scions of her race, and
that she never arrived at speaking French like a Parisian.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Grandmamma_Burton"></a>Grandmamma Burton.</i></div>

<p>Grandmamma Burton was also peculiar in her way. Her portrait
shows the regular Bourbon traits, the pear-shaped face and head
which culminates in Louis Philippe's. Although the wife of a country
clergyman, she never seemed to have attained the meekness of feeling
associated with that peaceful calling. The same thing is told of her
as was told of the Edgeworth family. On one occasion during the
absence of her husband, the house at Tuam was broken into by
thieves, probably some of her petted tenantry. She lit a candle and
went upstairs to fetch some gunpowder, loaded her pistols, and ran
down to the hall, when the robbers decamped. She asked the raw
Irish servant girl who had accompanied her what had become of the
light, and the answer was that it was standing on the barrel of "black
salt" upstairs; thereupon Grandmamma Burton had the pluck to walk
up to the garret and expose herself to the risk of being blown to
smithereens. When my father returned from service in Sicily, at the
end of the year, he found the estate in a terrible condition, and
obtained his mother's leave to take the matter in hand. He invited
all the tenants to dinner, and when speech time came on, after being
duly blarneyed by all present, he made a little address, dwelling with
some vigour upon the necessity of being for the future more regular
with the "rint." Faces fell, and the only result was, that when the
rent came to be collected, he was fired at so frequently (showing that
this state of things had been going on for some sixty or seventy years),
that, not wishing to lead the life of the "Galway woodcock," he gave
up the game, and allowed matters to take their own course.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Aunt_G"></a>Aunt G.</i></div>

<p>Another frequent visitor was popularly known as "Aunt G."&mdash;Georgina
Baker, the younger of the three sisters, who was then in
the heyday of youth and high spirits. An extremely handsome girl,
with blue eyes and dark hair and fine tall figure, she was the life
of the house as long as her visits lasted. Her share of the property
being £30,000, she had of course a number of offers from English
as well as foreigners. On the latter she soon learned to look shy,
having heard that one of her rejected suitors had exclaimed to his
friend, "Quelle dommage, avec cette petite ferme à vendre," the
wished-for farm, adjoining his property, happening then to be in the
market. Heiresses are not always fortunate, and she went on
refusing suitor after suitor, till ripe middle age, when she married
Robert Bagshaw, Esq., M.P. for Harwich. She wanted to adopt me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
intending to accompany me to Oxford and leave me her property,
but this project had no stay in it. At the time she was at Tours,
Aunt G. had a kind of "fad" that she would marry one of her
brother-in-law Burton's brothers. Her eldest sister Sarah had married
my uncle Burton, elder brother of my father, who, sorely against his
wish, which pointed to the Church, had been compelled by the
failure of the "rint" to become an army surgeon&mdash;the same who
had the disappointment at St. Helena.</p>

<p>At last it became apparent that Tours was no longer a place for us
who were approaching the ticklish time of teens. All Anglo-French
boys generally were remarkable young ruffians, who, at ten years of
age, cocked their hats and loved the ladies. Instead of fighting and
fagging, they broke the fine old worked glass church windows, purloined
their fathers' guns to shoot at the monuments in the churchyards,
and even the shops and bazaars were not safe from their impudent
raids. The ringleader of the gang was a certain Alek G&mdash;&mdash;, the
son of a Scotchmen of good family, who was afterwards connected
with or was the leading spirit of a transaction, which gave a tablet
and an inscription to Printing House Square. Alek was very handsome,
and his two sisters were as good looking as himself. He died
sadly enough at a hospital in Paris. Political matters, too, began to
look queer. The revolution which hurled Charles X. from the throne,
produced no outrages in quiet Tours, beyond large gatherings of
the people with an immense amount of noise, especially of "<i>Vive la
Chatte!</i>" (for La Charte), the good <i>commères</i> turning round and asking
one another whom the Cat might be that the people wished it so long
a life; but when Casimir Périer had passed through the town, and
"the three glorious days of July" had excited the multitude, things
began to look black, and cries of "<i>À bas les Anglais!</i>" were not uncommon.
An Englishmen was threatened with prison because the
horse he was driving accidentally knocked down an old woman, and a
French officer of the line, who was fond of associating with English
girls, was grossly insulted and killed in a dastardly duel by a
pastrycook.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="They_leave_Tours"></a>They leave Tours.</i></div>

<p>At last, after a long deliberation, the family resolved to leave
Tours. Travelling in those days, especially for a large family, was
a severe infliction. The old travelling carriages, which had grown
shabby in the coach-house, had to be taken out and furbished up,
and all the queer receptacles, imperial, boot, sword-case, and plate-chest,
to be stuffed with miscellaneous luggage. After the usual
sale by auction, my father took his departure, perhaps mostly regretted
by a little knot of Italian exiles, whom he liked on account
of his young years spent in Sicily, and whose society not improbably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
suggested his ultimate return to Italy. Then began the journey
along the interminable avenues of the old French roads, lined with
parallel rows of poplars, which met at a vanishing point of the far
distance. I found exactly the same thing, when travelling through
Lower Canada in 1860. Mighty dull work it was, whilst the French
postilion in his seven-league boots jogged along with his horses at
the rate of five miles an hour, never dreaming of increasing the rate,
till he approached some horridly paved town, when he cracked his
whip, like a succession of pistol shots, to the awe and delight of all
the sabots. Very slow hours they were, especially as the night wore
on, and the road, gleaming white between its two dark edges, looked
of endless length. And when at last the inn was reached, it proved
very unlike the inn of the present day. A hard bargain had to be
driven with a rapacious landlady, who, if you objected to her charges,
openly roared at you with arms akimbo, "that if you were not rich
enough to travel, you ought to stay at home." Then the beds had
to be inspected, the damp sheets to be aired, and the warming-pans
to be ordered, and, as dinner had always to be prepared after arrival,
it was not unusual to sit hungry for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The fatigues of the journey seriously affected my mother's health,
and she lost no time in falling very ill at Chartres. Then Grandmamma
Baker was sent for to act <i>garde-malade</i>, and to awe the children,
who were wild with delight at escaping school and masters, with the
weight of her sturdy Scotch arm. The family passed through Paris,
where the signs of fighting, bullets in the walls, and burnt houses,
had not been wholly obliterated, and were fortunate enough to escape
the cholera, which then for the first time attacked Europe in its very
worst form. Grandmamma Baker was very nearly as bad, for she
almost poisoned her beloved grandchildren, by stuffing our noses
and mouths full of the strongest camphor whenever we happened
to pass through a town. The cold plunge into English life was
broken by loitering on the sands of Dieppe. A wonderful old
ramshackle place it was in those days, holding a kind of intermediate
place between the dulness of Calais and the liveliness of "Boolone,"
as the denizens called it. It wanted the fine hotels and the <i>Établissement</i>,
which grew up under the Second Empire, but there was
during the summer a pleasant, natural kind of life, living almost
exclusively upon the sands and dipping in the water, galloping
about on little ponies, and watching the queer costumes of the
bathers, and discussing the new-comers. Though railways were not
dreamt of, many Parisians used to affect the place, and part of the
French nature seems to be, to rush into the sea as soon as they
see it.</p>

ready for buying. Next day the mother went down to the Trieste market, father
to work, and the children were left in charge of the cottage. When the parents
got near the cottage in late afternoon, the two children ran out and said, "We
have had such fun, mamma; we have played all day at killing pigs, and we have
done baby beautifully, and he squealed at first just like a real pig." The horrified
parents rushed in, and found truly that baby was beautifully done, hanging up
by the legs, his poor little stomach kept open by a bit of wood just like a real
pig, and had been dead for hours.&mdash;I. B.</p>

<h4>THE CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT TO ENGLAND.</h4>


<p>Landing in England was dolorous. Grandmamma Baker inflated
her nostrils, and, delighted at escaping from those <i>crapauds</i> and
their kickshaws, quoted with effusion her favourite Cowper, "England,
with all thy faults, I love thee still." The children scoffed. The air
of Brighton, full of smoke and blacks, appeared to them unfit for
breathing. The cold grey seas made them shudder. In the town
everything appeared so small, so prim, so mean, the little one-familied
houses contrasting in such a melancholy way with the big
buildings of Tours and Paris. We revolted against the coarse and
half-cooked food, and, accustomed to the excellent Bordeaux of
France, we found port, sherry, and beer like strong medicine; the
bread, all crumb and no crust, appeared to be half baked, and milk
meant chalk and water. The large joints of meat made us think
of Robinson Crusoe, and the vegetables <i>cuite à l'eau</i>, especially the
potatoes, which had never heard of <i>"Maître d'hôtel"</i> suggested the
roots of primitive man. Moreover, the national temper, fierce and
surly, was a curious contrast to the light-hearted French of middle
France. A continental lady of those days cautioned her son, who
was about to travel, against ridicule in France and the <i>canaille</i> in
England. The little children punched one another's heads on the
sands, the boys punched one another's heads in the streets, and in
those days a stand-up fight between men was not uncommon. Even
the women punched their children, and the whole lower-class society
seemed to be governed by the fist.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="School_at_Richmond"></a>School at Richmond.</i></div>

<p>My father had determined to send his boys to Eton to prepare
for Oxford and Cambridge. In the mean time some blundering
friend had recommended him a preparatory school. This was kept
by the Rev. Charles Delafosse, who rejoiced in the title of Chaplain
to the Duke of Cumberland, a scion of royalty, who had, apparently,
very little to do with the Church. Accordingly, the family went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Richmond, the only excitement of the journey being the rage of the
post-boys, when we boys on the box furtively poked their horses
with long sticks. After sundry attempts at housing themselves in
the tiny doll-rooms in the stuffy village, they at last found a house,
so called by courtesy, in "Maids of Honour Row," between the river
and the Green, a house with a strip of garden fronting it, which a
sparrow could hop across in thirty seconds. Opening upon the
same Green, stood that horror of horrors, the school, or the "Establishment,"
as it would <i>now</i> be called. It consisted of a large block
of buildings (detached), lying between the Green and the Old Town,
which has long been converted into dwelling-houses. In those
days it had a kind of paling round a paddock, forming a long
parallelogram, which enclosed some fine old elm trees. One side
was occupied by the house, and the other by the school-room. In
the upper stories of the former, were the dormitories with their small
white beds, giving the idea of the Lilliput Hospital; a kind of outhouse
attached to the dwelling was the place where the boys fed at
two long tables stretching the whole length of the room. The only
decoration of the palings were names cut all over their inner surfaces
and rectangular nails at the top, acting as <i>chevaux de frise</i>. The
school-room was the usual scene of hacked and well-used benches
and ink-stained desks, everything looking as mean and uncomfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>This was the kind of Dotheboys Hall, to which, in those days,
gentlemen were contented to send their sons, paying a hundred
a year, besides "perquisites" (plunder): on the Continent the same
treatment would be had for £20.</p>

<p>The Rev. Charles was a bluff and portly man, with dark hair and
short whiskers, whose grand aquiline nose took a prodigious deal of
snuff, and was not over active with the rod; but he was no more fit
to be a schoolmaster than the Grand Cham of Tartary. He was,
however, rather a favourite with the boys, and it was shrewdly
whispered, that at times he returned from dining abroad half-seas
over. His thin-lipped wife took charge of the <i>ménage</i>, and looked
severely after the provisions, and swayed with an iron sceptre the
maid-servants, who had charge of the smaller boys. The ushers
were the usual consequential lot of those days. There was the handsome
and dressy usher, a general favourite with the fair; the shabby
and mild usher, despised by even the smallest boy; and the unfortunate
French usher, whose life was a fair foretaste of Purgatory.</p>

<p>Instead of learning anything at this school, my brother and I
lost much of what we knew, especially in French, and the principal
acquisitions were, a certain facility of using our fists, and a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
development of ruffianism. I was in one perpetual scene of fights;
at one time I had thirty-two affairs of honour to settle, the place of
meeting being the school-room, with the elder boys sitting in judgment.
On the first occasion I received a blow in the eye, which I
thought most unfair, and having got my opponent down I proceeded
to hammer his head against the ground, using his ears by way of
handles. My indignation knew no bounds when I was pulled off by
the bystanders, and told to let my enemy stand up again. "Stand
up!" I cried, "after all the trouble I've had to get the fellow down."
At last the fighting went on to such an extent, that I was beaten as
thin as a shotten herring, and the very servant-maids, when washing
me on Saturday night, used to say, "Drat the child! what has he
been doing? he's all black and blue." Edward fought just as well
as I did, but he was younger and more peaceable. Maria says that I
was a thin, dark little boy, with small features and large black eyes,
and was extremely proud, sensitive, shy, nervous, and of a melancholy,
affectionate disposition. Such is the effect of a boys' school
after a few months' trial, when the boys learn to despise mother and
sisters, and to affect the rough as much as possible, and this is not
only in England, but everywhere where the boy first escapes from
petticoat government. He does not know what to do to show his
manliness. There is no stronger argument in favour of mixed
schools, up to a <i>certain age</i>, of boys and girls together.</p>

<p>At the little Richmond theatre we were taken to see Edmund
Kean, who lived in a cottage on the Green. He had gentle blood
in his veins, grandson (illegitimate) of George Savile, Marquis of
Halifax, and that accounted for his Italian, or rather un-John-Bull
appearance, and for his fiery power. I saw him in his famous
Richard III. <i>rôle</i>, and remember only what old Colley Grattan
described, "Looks bloated with brandy, nose red, cheeks blotched,
and eyes blood-shot." He was drinking himself to death. His
audience appeared not a little afraid of him; perhaps they had
heard of the Guernsey scene, where he stood at the footlights and
flashed out, "Unmannered dogs! stand ye where <i>I</i> command."</p>

<p>Our parents very unwisely determined to correct all personal
vanity in their offspring by always dwelling upon our ugliness.
My nose was called cocked; it was a Cross which I had to carry, and
was a perpetual plague to me; and I was assured that the only
decent feature in my face was my teeth. Maria, on account of her
fresh complexion, was called Blousabella; and even Edward, whose
features were perfect, and whom Frenchmen used to stop and stare
at in the streets, and call him "Le petit Napoleon," was told to
nauseousness that "handsome is as handsome does." In later life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
we were dressed in a marvellous fashion; a piece of yellow nankin
would be bought to dress the whole family, like three sticks of
barley sugar. Such was the discipline of the day, and nothing could
be more ill-judged; it inflicted an amount of torment upon sensitive
children which certainly was not intended, but which had the very
worst effect.</p>

<p>If we children quarrelled, and turned up our noses at the food
in English hotels, what must have been our surprise at the food of
an English school? Breakfast at 8 a.m., consisting of very blue
milk and water, in chipped and broken-handled mugs of the same
colour. The boys were allowed tea from home, but it was a
perpetual battle to get a single drink of it. The substantials were
a wedge of bread with a glazing of butter. The epicures used to
collect the glazing to the end of the slice in order to convert it into
a final <i>bonne bouche</i>. The dinner at one o'clock began with stickjaw
(pudding) and ended with meat, as at all second-rate schools. The
latter was as badly cooked as possible, black out and blue inside,
gristly and sinewy. The vegetables were potatoes, which could
serve for grapeshot, and the hateful carrot. Supper was a repetition
of breakfast, and, at an age when boys were making bone and
muscle, they went hungry to bed.</p>

<p>Occasionally the pocket-money and tips were clubbed, and a
"room" would go in for a midnight feed of a quartern loaf, ham,
polony, and saveloys, with a quantity of beer and wine, which
generally led to half a dozen fights. Saturday was a day to be feared
on account of its peculiar pie, which contained all the waifs and
strays of the week. On the Sunday there was an attempt at plum-pudding
of a peculiarly pale and leaden hue, as if it had been
unjustly defrauded of its due allowance of plums. And this dull
routine lasted throughout the scholastic year. School hours were
from seven till nine, and ten to one, and three to five, without other
changes, save at the approach of the holidays, when a general burst
of singing, locally called "challenging," took place. Very few were
the schoolfellows we met in after life. The ragged exceptions were
Guildford Onslow, the Claimant's friend. Tuckey Baines, as he was
called on account of his exploits on Saturday pie, went into the
Bombay army, and was as disagreeable and ill-conditioned as when
he was a bully at school. He was locally celebrated for hanging the
wrong Mahommad, and for his cure for Sindee litigiousness, by
making complainant and defendant flog each other in turn. The
only schoolboy who did anything worthy, was Bobby Delafosse
(who was appointed to the 26th Regiment, N.I.), who showed
immense pluck, and died fighting bravely in the Indian Mutiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
I met him in Bombay shortly before I went off to the North-West
Provinces, but my remembrances of the school were so painful, that
I could not bear to recognize him. In fact, that part of life, which
most boys dwell upon with the greatest pleasure, and concerning
which, most autobiographers tell the longest stories&mdash;school and
college&mdash;was ever a nightmare to us. It was like the "Blacking-shop"
of Charles Dickens.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Measles_disperse_the_School"></a>Measles disperse the School.</i></div>

<p>Before the year concluded, an attack of measles broke out in the
school, several of the boys died, and it was found necessary to disperse
the survivors. We were not hard-hearted, but we were
delighted to get home. We worked successfully on the fears of
Aunt G., which was assisted by my cadaverous appearance, and it
was resolved to move us from school, to our infinite joy. My
father had also been thoroughly sick of "Maids of Honour Row"
and "Richmond Green." He was sighing for shooting and boar-hunting
in the French forests, and he felt that he had done quite
enough for the education of the boys, which was turning out so
badly. He resolved to bring us up abroad, and picked up the
necessary assistance for educating us by tutor and governess. Miss
Ruxton, a stout red-faced girl, was thoroughly up in the three R's,
and was intended to direct Maria's education. Mr. Du Pré, an
undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford, son of the Rector of Berkhampstead,
wanted to see life on the Continent, and was not unwilling
to see it with a salary. He was an awkward-looking John
Bull article, with a narrow forehead, eyes close together, and thick
lips, which secured him a perpetual course of caricaturing. He
used to hit out hard whenever he found the caricatures, but only
added bitterness to them. Before he had been in the family a
week, I obliged him with a sketch of his tomb and the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Stand, passenger! hang down thy head and weep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A young man from Exeter here doth sleep;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If any one ask who that young man be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis the Devil's dear friend and companion&mdash;Du Pré"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>which was merely an echo of Shakespeare and John à Combe, but
it showed a fine sense of independence.</p>

<p>I really caught the measles at school, and was nursed by Grandmamma
Baker in Park Street. It was the only infantine malady that
I ever had. The hooping-cough only attacked me on my return from
Harar, when staying with my friend Dr. Steinhaüser at Aden, in
1853. As soon as I was well enough to travel, the family embarked
at the Tower Wharf for Boulogne. We boys scandalized every one
on board. We shrieked, we whooped, we danced for joy. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
shook our fists at the white cliffs, and loudly hoped we should never
see them again. We hurrah'd for France, and hooted for England,
"The Land on which the Sun ne'er sets&mdash;nor rises," till the sailor
who was hoisting the Jack, looked upon us as a pair of little monsters.
In our delight at getting away from school and the stuffy little
island, we had no idea of the disadvantages which the new kind of
life would inflict on our future careers. We were too young to
know. A man who brings up his family abroad, and who lives there
for years, must expect to lose all the friends who could be useful to
him when he wishes to start them in life. The conditions of society
in England are so complicated, and so artificial, that those who
would make their way in the world, especially in public careers,
must be broken to it from their earliest day. The future soldiers
and statesmen must be prepared by Eton and Cambridge. The
more English they are, even to the cut of their hair, the better. In
consequence of being brought up abroad, we never thoroughly
understood English society, nor did society understand us. And,
lastly, it is a <i>real</i> advantage to belong to some parish. It is a great
thing, when you have won a battle, or explored Central Africa, to be
welcomed home by some little corner of the Great World, which
takes a pride in your exploits, because they reflect honour upon
itself. In the contrary condition you are a waif, a stray; you are a
blaze of light, without a focus. Nobody outside your own fireside
cares.</p>

<p>No man ever gets on in the world, or rises to the head of affairs,
unless he is a representative of his nation. Taking the marking
characters of the last few years&mdash;Palmerston, Thiers, Cavour, and
Bismarck&mdash;what were they but simply the types of their various
nationalities? In point of intellect Cavour was a first-rate man,
Thiers second-rate, Palmerston third-rate, whilst Bismarck was
strength, Von Moltke brain. Their success in life was solely owing
to their representing the failings, as well as the merits of their several
nationalities. Thiers, for instance, was the most thoroughbred
possible <i>épicier</i>, and yet look at his success. And his death was
mourned even in England, and yet he was the bitterest enemy that
England ever had. His Chauvinism did more than the Crimean
War to abolish the prestige of England. Unhappily for his Chauvinism,
it also thoroughly abolished France.</p>

<p>Mr. Du Pré, the tutor, and Miss Ruxton, the governess, had their
work cut out for them. They attempted to commence with a strict
discipline; for instance, the family passing through Paris lodged at
the Hôtel Windsor, and they determined to walk the youngsters out
school fashion. The consequence was that when the walk extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to the boulevards, the young ones, on agreement, knowing Paris
well, suddenly ran away, and were home long before the unfortunate
strangers could find their way, and reported that their unlucky
tutor and governess had been run over by an omnibus. There was
immense excitement till the supposed victims walked in immensely
tired, having wandered over half Paris, not being able to find their
way. A scene followed, but the adversaries respected each other
more after that day.</p>

<p>The difficulty was now where to colonize. One of the peculiarities
of the little English colonies was the unwillingness of their denizens
to return to them when once they had left them. My father had
been very happy at Tours, and yet he religiously avoided it. He
passed through Orleans&mdash;a horrid hole, with as many smells as
Cologne&mdash;and tried to find a suitable country house near it, but in
vain; everything seemed to smell of goose and gutter. Then he
drifted on to Blois, in those days a kind of home of the British
stranger, and there he thought proper to call a halt. At last a house
was found on the high ground beyond the city, which, like Tours,
lies mainly on the left bank of the river, and where most of the
English colonists dwelt. There is no necessity of describing this
little bit of England in France, which was very like Tours. When
one describes one colony, one describes them all. The notables
were Sir Joseph Leeds, Colonel Burnes, and a sister of Sir Stamford
Raffles, who lived in the next-door villa, if such a term may be
applied to a country house in France in 1831. The only difference
from Tours was, there was no celebrated physician, no pack of hounds,
and no parson. Consequently service on Sundays had to be read
at home by the tutor, and the evening was distinguished by one of
Blair's sermons. This was read out by us children, each taking a
turn. The discourse was from one of Blair's old three volumes,
which appeared to have a soporific effect upon the audience. Soft
music was gradually heard proceeding from the nasal organs of
father and mother, tutor and governess; and then we children,
preserving the same tone of voice, entered into a conversation, and
discussed matters, until the time came to a close.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Education_at_Blois"></a>Education at Blois.</i></div>

<p>At Blois we were now entering upon our teens; our education
was beginning in real earnest. Poor Miss Ruxton soon found her
task absolutely impossible, and threw up the service. A schoolroom
was instituted, where time was wasted upon Latin and Greek
for six or seven hours a day, besides which there was a French
master&mdash;one of those obsolete little old men, who called themselves
<i>Professeurs-ès-lettres</i>, and the great triumph of whose life was that
he had read Herodotus in the original. The dancing-master was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
large and pompous oldster, of course an <i>ancien militaire</i>, whose kit
and whose capers were by contrast peculiarly ridiculous, and who
quoted at least once every visit, "Oh, Richard! oh, mon roi!"
He taught, besides country dances, square and round, the Minuet
de la Cour, the Gavotte de Vestris, and a Danse Chinoise, which
consisted mainly in turning up thumbs and toes. The only favourite
amongst all those professors was the fencing-master, also an old
soldier, who had lost the thumb of his right hand in the wars, which
of course made him a <i>gauché</i> in loose fencing. We boys gave
ourselves up with ardour to this study, and passed most of our
leisure hours in exchanging thrusts. We soon learned not to
neglect the mask: I passed my foil down Edward's throat, and
nearly destroyed his uvula, which caused me a good deal of sorrow.
The amusements consisted chiefly of dancing at evening parties, we
boys choosing the tallest girls, especially a very tall Miss Donovan.
A little fishing was to be had, my father being a great amateur.
There were long daily walks, swimming in summer, and brass
cannons, bought in the toy shops, were loaded to bursting.</p>

<p>The swimming was very easily taught; in the present day boys and
girls go to school and learn it like dancing. In our case Mr. Du Pré
supported us by a hand under the stomach, taught us how to use our
arms and legs, and to manage our breath, after which he withdrew his
hand and left us to float as we best could.</p>

<p>This life lasted for a year, till all were thoroughly tired of it. Our
father and mother were imperceptibly lapsing into the category of
professed invalids, like people who have no other business in life,
except to be sick. This was a class exceptionally common in the
unoccupied little English colonies that studded the country. It was
a far robuster institution than the Parisian invalid, whose object in
life was to appear <i>maladive et souffrante</i>. The British <i>malade</i>
consumed a considerable quantity of butcher's meat, but although he
or she always saw death in the pot, they had not the moral courage
to refuse what disagreed with them. They tried every kind of drug
and nostrum known, and answered every advertisement, whether it
agreed with their complaint or not. Their <i>table de nuit</i> was covered
with bottles and gallipots. They dressed themselves three or four
times a day for the change of climate, and insensibly acquired a
horror of dining out, or passing the evening away from home. They
had a kind of rivalry with other invalids; nothing offended them
more than to tell them that they were in strong health, and that if they
had been hard-worked professionals in England, they would have
been ill once a year, instead of once a month. Homœopathy was a
great boon to them, and so was hydropathy. So was the grape-cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and all the humbug invented by non-professionals, such as hunger-cure
and all that nonsense.</p>

<p>Our parents suffered from asthma, an honest and respectable kind
of complaint, which if left to itself, allows you, like gout, to last till
your eightieth year, but treated systematically, and with the aid of the
doctor, is apt to wear you out. Grandmamma Baker, who came over
to Blois, compared them in her homely Scotch fashion to two
buckets in a well. She was very wroth with my father, when,
remembering the days of his youth, he began to hug the idea of
returning to Italy and seeing the sun, and the general conclusion of
her philippics ("You'll kill your wife, sir") did not change his
resolution. She even insinuated that in the olden day there had
been a Sicilian young woman who received the Englishman's pay, and
so distributed it as to keep off claims. So Grandmamma Baker was
sent off to her beloved England, "whose faults she still loved."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="They_leave_Blois_for_Italy"></a>They leave Blois for Italy.</i></div>

<p>The old yellow chariot was brought out of the dusty coach-house
once more, and furbished up, and, after farewell dinners and parties
all round, the family turned their back on Blois. The journey was
long, being broken by sundry attacks of asthma, and the posting
and style of travel were full of the usual discomforts. In crossing
over the Tarare a drunken postilion nearly threw one of the carriages
over the precipice, and in shooting the Pont de St. Esprit the
steamer nearly came to grief under one of the arches. We stayed
a short time in Lyons, in those days a perfect den of thieves.
From Avignon my tutor and I were driven to the Fountain of
Vaucluse, the charming blue well in the stony mountain, and the
memories of Petrarch and Laura were long remembered. The driver
insisted upon a full gallop, and the protests of the unfortunate
Englishman, who declared every quarter of an hour that he was the
father of a large family, were utterly disregarded.</p>

<p>The first view of Provence was something entirely new, and the
escape was hailed from the flat fields and the long poplar avenues of
Central France. Everything, even the most squalid villages, seemed
to fall into a picture. It was something like a sun that burst upon the
rocks. The olive trees laden with purple fruit were a delight after
the apples and pears, and the contrast between the brown rock and
the blue Mediterranean, was quite a new sensation. At Marseilles
we embarked for Leghorn, which was then, in Italy, very much what
Lyons was in France. It was the head-quarters of brigands. Indeed
it was reported that a society existed, whose members were
pledged to stab their fellow-creatures, whenever they could do it
safely. And it was brought to light by the remorse of a son, who
had killed his father by mistake. The Grand Duke of Tuscany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
with his weak benevolence, was averse to shedding blood, and the
worst that these wretches expected was to be dressed in the red or
the yellow of the Galeotti, and to sweep the streets and to bully the
passenger for <i>bakshish</i>. Another unpleasant development was the
quantity of vermin,&mdash;even the washerwoman's head appeared to be
walking off her shoulders. Still there was a touch of Italian art
about the place, in the days before politics and polemics had
made Italian art, with the sole exception of sculpture, the basest
thing on the Continent: the rooms were large, high, and airy, the
frescoes on the ceiling were good, and the pictures had not been sold
to Englishmen, and replaced by badly coloured daubs, and cheap
prints of the illustrated paper type.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Pisa"></a>Pisa.</i></div>

<p>After a few days, finding Leghorn utterly unfit to inhabit, my
father determined to transfer himself to Pisa. There, after the usual
delay, he found a lodging on the wrong side of the Arno&mdash;that is
to say, the side which does not catch the winter sun&mdash;in a huge
block of buildings opposite the then highest bridge. Dante's old
"Vituperio delle gante" was then the dullest abode known to man,
except perhaps his sepulchre. The climate was detestable (Iceland
on the non-sunny, Madeira on the sunny side of the river), but the
doctors thought it good enough for their patients; consequently it
was the hospital of a few sick Britishers upon a large scale. These
unfortunates had much better have been left at home instead of
being sent to die of discomfort in Tuscany, but there they would
have died upon the doctor's hands. The dullness of the place was
something preternatural.</p>

<p>The Italians had their own amusements. The principal one was
the opera, a perfect den of impurity, where you were choked by the
effluvia of <i>pastrane</i> or the brigands' cloaks, which descended from
grandfather to grandson. The singing, instrumentation, and acting
were equally vile, but the Pisani had not the critical ferocity of the
Livornesi, who were used to visit the smallest defect with "Torni in
iscena, bestia!" The other form of amusement was the conversazione.
Here you entered about six o'clock, and found an
enormous room, with a dwarf sofa and an avenue of two lines of
chairs projecting from it perpendicularly. You were expected to
walk through the latter, which were occupied by the young women,
to the former, upon which sat the dowagers, and after the three
<i>saluts d'usage</i> and the compliments of the season, you backed out
by the way you came in, and then passed the evening leaning over
the back of the chair of the fair dame whose <i>cavaliere servente</i>
you were supposed to be. Refreshments were an occasional glass
of cold water; in luxurious houses there were water ices and sugared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
wafers. They complain that we English are not happy in society
without eating, and I confess that I prefer a good beefsteak to cold
water and water ices.</p>

<p>There was no bad feeling between the Italians and English; they
simply ignored one another. Nothing could be shadier than the
English colony at Pisa. As they had left England, the farther they
were the more wretched they became, till they reached the climax
at Naples. They had no club, as at Tours, and they met to read
their <i>Gagliani</i> at a grocer's shop on the Lung' Arno. They had
their parson and doctor and their tea-caddies, but the inhospitable
nature of the country&mdash;and certainly Italy is the least given to the
savage virtue&mdash;seemed to have affected the strangers. Equally
unknown were the dinner-parties of Tours and the hops of Blois.
No one shot and no one fished. A madman used to plunge
through the ice on the Lung' Arno in midwinter, but most of
them contented themselves with promenading the Quai and basking
in its wintry sun till they returned to their stuffy rooms. A good
many of them were half-pay officers. Others were Jamaican planters,
men who had made their fortunes in trade; the rest were nondescripts
whom nobody knew. At times some frightful scandal broke
out in consequence of some gentleman who had left his country
for his country's good.</p>

<p>The discomforts of Pisa were considerable. The only fireplace
in those days was a kind of brazier, put in the middle of the room.
The servants were perfect savages, who had to be taught the very
elements of service, and often at the end of the third day a great
burly peasant would take leave, saying, "Non mi basta l'anima!"
My father started a fearful equipage in the shape of a four-wheeled
trap, buying for the same a hammer-headed brute of a horse which
at once obtained the name of "Dobbin." Dobbin was a perfect
demon steed, and caused incalculable misery, as every person was
supposed to steal his oats. One of us boys was sent down to
superintend his breakfast, dinner, and supper. On journeys it
was the same, and we would have been delighted to see Dobbin
hanged, drawn, and quartered. We tried riding him in private, but
the brute used to plant his forelegs and kick up and down like a
rocking-horse. The trap was another subject of intense misery.
The wheels were always supposed to be wanting greasing, and as
the natives would steal the grease, it was necessary that one of
us should always superintend the greasing. There is no greater
mistake than that of trying to make boys useful by making them
do servant's work.</p>

<p>The work of education went on nimbly, if not merrily. To former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
masters was added an Italian master, who was at once dubbed
"Signor No," on account of the energy of his negation. The
French master unfortunately discovered that his three pupils had
poetic talents; the consequence was that we were set to write
versical descriptions, which we hated worse than Telemachus and
the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<p>And a new horror appeared in the shape of a violin master.
Edward took kindly to the infliction, worked very hard, and became
an amateur almost equal to a professional; was offered fair pay
as member of an orchestra in Italy, and kept it up after going into
the Army, till the calls of the Mess made it such a nuisance that
he gave it up; but took to it again later in life <i>con amore</i>. I always
hated my fiddle, and after six months it got me into a terrible scrape,
and brought the study to an untimely end. Our professor was
a thing like Paganini, length without breadth, nerves without flesh,
hung on wires, all hair and no brain, except for fiddling. The
creature, tortured to madness by a number of false notes, presently
addressed his pupil in his grandiloquent Tuscan manner, "Gli altri
scolari sono bestie, ma voi siete un Arci-bestia." The "Arci"
offended me horribly, and, in a fury of rage, I broke my violin upon
my master's head; and then my father made the discovery that his
eldest son had no talent for music, and I was not allowed to learn
any more.</p>

<p>Amongst the English at Pisa we met with some Irish cousins,
whose names had been Conyngham, but they had, for a fortune,
very sensibly added "Jones" to it, and who, very foolishly, were
ashamed of it ever after. There was a boy, whose face looked as if
badly cut out of a half-boiled potato, dotted with freckles so as to
resemble a goose's egg. There was a very pretty girl, who afterwards
became Mrs. Seaton. The mother was an exceedingly handsome
woman of the Spanish type, and it was grand to see her
administering correction to "bouldness." They seemed principally
to travel in Italy for the purpose of wearing out old clothes, and
afterwards delighted in telling how many churches and palaces they
had "done" in Rome per diem. The cute Yankee always travels,
when he is quite unknown, in his best bib and tucker, reserving his
old clothes for his friends who appreciate him. Altogether the
C.J.'s were as fair specimens of Northern barbarians invading the
South, as have been seen since the days of Brennus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Siena"></a>Siena.</i></div>

<p>The summer of '32 was passed at Siena, where a large rambling
old house was found inside the walls. The venerable town, whose
hospitality was confined to an inscription over the city gate, was
perhaps one of the dullest places under heaven. No country in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
world shows less hospitality&mdash;even Italians amongst themselves&mdash;than
Italy, and in the case of strangers they have perhaps many
reasons to justify their churlishness.</p>

<p>Almost all the English at Siena were fugitives from justice, social
or criminal. One man walked off with his friend's wife, another with
his purse. There was only one old English lady in the place who
was honourable, and that was a Mrs. Russell, who afterwards killed
herself with mineral waters. She lived in a pretty little <i>quinta</i>
outside the town, where moonlight nights were delightful, and where
the nightingales were louder than usual. Beyond this amusement
we had little to do, except at times to peep at the gate of Palone,
to study very hard, and to hide from the world our suits of nankin.
The weary summer drew to a close. The long-surviving chariot was
brought out, and then Dobbin, with the "cruelty van," was made
ready for the march.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Vetturino-Travelling"></a>Vetturino-Travelling.</i></div>

<p>Travelling in <i>vetturino</i> was not without its charm. It much
resembled marching in India during the slow old days. It is true
you seldom progressed along more than five miles an hour, and
uphill at three. Moreover, the harness was perpetually breaking,
and at times a horse fell lame; but you saw the country thoroughly,
the <i>vetturino</i> knew the name of every house, and you went slowly
enough to impress everything upon your memory. The living
now was none of the best; food seemed to consist mostly of
omelettes and pigeons. The pigeons, it is said, used to desert the
dove-cotes every time they saw an English travelling-carriage
approaching. And the omelettes showed more hair in them than
eggs usually produce. The bread and wine, however, were good,
and adulteration was then unknown. The lodging was on a par
with the food, and insect powder was not invented or known. Still,
taking all in all, it is to be doubted whether we are more comfortable
in the Grand Hotel in these days when every hotel is grand, when
all mutton is <i>pré salé</i>, when all the beer is bitter, when all the sherry
is dry.</p>

<p>It was now resolved to pass the Holy Week at Rome, and the only
events of the journey, which went on as usual, were the breaking
down of Dobbin's "cruelty van" in a village near Perugia, where the
tutor and boys were left behind to look after repairs. We long
remembered the peculiar evening which we passed there. The head
ostler had informed us that there was an opera, and that he was the
<i>primo violino</i>. We went to the big barn, that formed the theatre.
A kind of "Passion play" was being performed, with lengthy intervals
of music, and all the mysteries of the faith were submitted to the
eyes of the faithful. The only disenchanting detail was, that a dove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
not being procurable, its place was supplied by a turkey-cock, and
the awful gabbling of the ill-behaved volatile caused much more
merriment than was decorous.</p>

<p>We, who had already examined Voltaire with great interest, were
delighted with the old Etruscan city of Perugia, and were allowed a
couple of hours' "leave" to visit Pietro di Aretino's tomb, and we
loitered by the Lake Thrasimene.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Florence"></a>Florence.</i></div>

<p>The march was short, and the family took a house on the north
side of the Arno, near the Boboli Gardens, in Florence. The City of
Flowers has always had a reputation beyond what it deserved.
Though too fair to be looked upon except upon holidays, it has
discomforts of its own. The cold, especially during the <i>Tramontana</i>
blowing from the Apennines, is that of Scotland. The heat during
the dog-days, when the stone pavements seem to be fit for baking,
reminds one of Cairo during a <i>Khamsin</i>, and the rains are at times
as heavy and persistent as in Central Africa. The Italians and the
English, even in those days, despite all the efforts of the amiable
Grand Duke, did not mix well.</p>

<p>Colonies go on as they begin, and the Anglo-Florentine flock
certainly has contained, contains, and ever will contain some very
black sheep. They were always being divided into cliques. They
were perpetually quarrelling. The parson had a terrible life. One
of the churchwardens was sure to be some bilious old Indian, and
a common character was to be a half-pay Indian officer who had
given laws, he said, to millions, who supported himself by gambling,
and induced all his cronies to drink hard, the whispered excuse
being, that he had shot a man in a duel somewhere. The old
ladies were very scandalous. There were perpetual little troubles,
like a rich and aged widow being robbed and deserted by her Italian
spouse, and resident old gentlemen, when worsted at cards, used to
quarrel and call one another liars. Amongst the number was a
certain old Dr. Harding who had a large family. His son was sent
into the army, and was dreadfully wounded under Sir Charles Napier
in Sind. He lived to be Major-General Francis Pim Harding, C.B.,
and died in 1875.</p>

<p>Another remarkable family was that of old Colonel de Courcy.
He had some charming daughters, and I met his son John when
he was in the Turkish Contingent and I was Chief of the Staff of
Irregular Cavalry in the Crimea.</p>

<p>Still Florence was always Florence. The climate, when it was
fine, was magnificent. The views were grand, and the most charming
excursions lay within a few hours' walk or drive. The English were
well treated, perhaps too well, by the local Government, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
opportunities of studying Art were first-rate. Those wonderful
Loggie and the Pitti Palace contained more high Art than is to be
found in all London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna put together, and
we soon managed to become walking catalogues. A heavy storm,
however, presently broke the serenity of the domestic atmosphere at
Siena.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Shooting"></a>Shooting.</i></div>

<p>We boys had been allowed to begin regular shooting with an
old single-barrelled Manton, a hard-hitter which had been changed
from flint to percussion. We practised gunnery in secret every
moment we could, and presently gave our tutor a specimen of our
proficiency. He had been instituting odious comparisons between
Edward's length and that of his gun, and went so far as to say that
for sixpence he would allow a shot at fifty yards. On this being
accepted with the firm determination of peppering him, he thought
it better to substitute his hat, and he got away just in time to see it
riddled like a sieve. We then began to despise shooting with small
shot.</p>

<p>Our parents made a grand mistake about the shooting excursions,
especially the mother, who, frightened lest anything should occur,
used to get up quarrels to have an excuse to forbid the shooting
parties, as punishment. It was soon found out and resented
accordingly.</p>

<p>We hoarded the weekly francs which each received, we borrowed
Maria's savings, <i>i.e.</i> the poor girl was never allowed to keep it for
a day, and invested in what was then known as a "case of pistols."
My father&mdash;who, when in Sicily with his regiment, had winged
a brother-officer, an Irishman, for saying something unpleasant, had
carefully and fondly nursed him, and shot him again as soon as ever
he recovered, crippling him for life&mdash;saw the turn that matters were
taking, and ordered the "saw-handles" to be ignominiously returned
to the shop. The shock was severe to the <i>pun d'onor</i> of we two
Don Quixotes.</p>

<p>I have a most pleasant remembrance of Maria Garcia, a charming
young girl, before she became wife and "divine devil" to the old
French merchant Morbihan. Both she and her sister (afterwards
Madame Viardot) were going through severe training under the
old Tartar of a father Garcia, who was, however, a splendid musician
and determined to see his girls succeed. They tell me she had
spites and rages and that manner of thing in after life, but I can
only remember her as worthy of Alfred de Musset's charming stanza.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Rome_in_Holy_Week"></a>Rome in Holy Week.</i></div>

<p>After a slow but most interesting drive we reached the Eternal
City, and, like all the world, were immensely impressed by the
entrance at the Porto del Popolo. The family secured apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in the Piazza di Spagna, which was then, as it is now, the capital of
English Rome. Everything in it was English, the librarian, the
grocer, and all the other little shops, and mighty little it has changed
during the third of a century. In 1873, when my wife and I stayed
there, the only points of difference observed were the presence of
Americans and the large gilded advertisements of the photographers.
The sleepy atmosphere was the same, and the same was the drowsy
old fountain.</p>

<p>At Rome sight-seeing was carried on with peculiar ardour. With
"Mrs. Starke" under the arm, for "Murray" and "Baedeker" were
not invented in those days, we young ones went from Vatican to the
Capitol, from church to palazzo, from ruin to ruin. We managed
to get introductions to the best studios, and made acquaintance with
all the shops which contained the best collections of coins, of cameos,
of model temples, in rosso-antico, and giallo-antico, and of all the
treasures of Roman Art, ancient and modern. We passed our days
in running about the town, and whenever we found an opportunity,
we made excursions into the country, even ascending Mount Soracte.
In those days Rome was not what it is now. It was the ghost of the
Imperial City, the mere shadow of the Mistress of the world. The
great Forum was a level expanse of ground, out of which the half-buried
ruins rose. The Coliseum had not changed for a century.
The Palatine hill had never dreamt of excavation. The greater part
of the space within the old walls, that represents the ancient City, was
a waste, what would in Africa be called bush, and it was believed
that turning up the ground caused fatal fevers. It had no pretensions
to be a Capital. It wanted fortifications; the walls could be
breached with six-pounders. The Tiber was not regulated, and
periodically flooded the lower town. The Ghetto was a disgrace.
Nothing could be fouler than the Trastevere: and the Leonine City,
with the exception of St. Peter's and the Vatican, was a piggery.</p>

<p>At Rome there was then very little society. People met when
doing the curiosities, and the principal amusements were conversaziones,
when the only conspicuous object was some old Cardinal
sitting in red, enthroned upon a sofa. Good old Gregory XVI.
did not dislike foreigners, and was even intimate with a certain
number of heretics, but <i>that</i> could not disperse the sleepy atmosphere
of the place, whilst the classes of society were what the
satirical French duchesse called, 'une noblesse de Sacrament'&mdash;and
yet it was the season of the year. Then, as now, the wandering
world pressed to Rome to see ceremonies of the Holy Week, to
hear the music of the Sistine Chapel, to assist at the annual conversion
of a Jew at St. John of Lateran, to walk gaping about at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
interior of St. Peter's, and to enjoy the magnificent illuminations,
which were spoiled by a high wind, and a flood of rain. Nothing
could be more curious than the contrast between the sons of the
Holy City and the barbarians from the North, and the far West, when
the Pope stood in the balcony delivering his benediction <i>urbi et orbi</i>;
the English and Irish Catholics seemed to be overwhelmed with awe
whilst the Romans delivered themselves of small jokes, very audible
withal, upon the mien and the demeanor of the Vecchierello.
Inside the great cathedral the crowd used to be of the most pushing
kind, and young priests attempted to scale one's shoulders. Protestant
ladies consumed furtive sandwiches, and here and there an aged
sightseer was thrown down and severely trampled upon. In fact,
there was a perfect opposition between the occasion of the ceremony
and the way it was carried out.</p>

<p>It was necessary to leave Rome in time to reach Naples before
the hot season began, and return to summer quarters. In those
days the crossing of the Pontine Marshes was considered not a little
dangerous. Heavy breakfasts were eaten to avoid the possible effect
of malaria upon an empty stomach, and the condemned pistols were
ostentatiously loaded to terrify the banditti, who were mostly the
servants and hangers-on of the foul little inns.</p>

<p>At Terracina we found an Englishman temporarily under arrest.
This was Mr. St. John, who had just shot in a duel Count Controfiani.
The history of the latter was not a little curious. He was a red-haired
Neapolitan, extremely plain in appearance, and awkward in
manner, but touchy and sensitive in the extreme. His friends and
his acquaintances chose to make a butt of him, little fancying how
things were going to end. One day he took leave of them all,
saying that he was going to travel for some years. He disguised
himself with a wig, and hid in the suburbs, practising pistol-shooting,
foil, and broadsword. When satisfied with his own progress, he
reappeared suddenly in society, and was received with a shout of
ironical welcome, "Ecco il nostro bel Controfiani." He slapped
the face of the ringleader, and in the duel which followed cut him
almost to pieces. After two or three affairs of the kind, his
reputation was thoroughly made, even in a City where duelling was
so common as Naples. At last, by some mischance, he met St. John
at Rome, and the two became intimate. They used to practise
pistol-shooting together, and popular report declares that both
concealed their game. At last a quarrel arose about some young
person, and Controfiani was compelled to fight at the pleasure of a
member of the Royal family of Naples, of whose suite he was. The
duel was to be <i>à la barrière</i>, first shot at twenty-five paces, and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to advance twelve, after standing the fire. The delay was so great
that the seconds began to show signs of impatience, when St. John
levelled his pistol, and hit his adversary in the flank, above the hip.
Controfiani had the courage to plug his wound with the forefinger
of his left hand, and had the folly to attempt advancing, mortally
wounded as he was. The movement shook him, his hand was unsteady;
his bullet whizzed past St. John's head, and he was dead
a few hours later.</p>

<p>The family halted a short while at Capua, then a quiet little
country town, equally thoughtless of the honours of the past, or the
fierce scenes that waited it in the future; many years afterwards my
friend Blakeley of the Guns, and I, offered the Government of King
Francis, to go out to rifle the cannon, which was to defend them
against Garibaldi and his banditti. Unfortunately the offer came
too late, It would have been curious had a couple of Englishmen
managed, by shooting Garibaldi, to baffle the plans which Lord Pam.
had laid with so much astuteness and perseverance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Sorrento"></a>Sorrento.</i></div>

<p>At Naples a house was found upon the Chiaja, and after trying it
for a fortnight, and finding it perfectly satisfactory and agreeing to
take it for the next season, the family went over to Sorrento. This,
in those days, was one of the most pleasant <i>villegiature</i> in Italy.
The three little villages that studded the long tongue of rock and
fertile soil, were separated from one another by long tracts of orchard
and olive ground, instead of being huddled together, as they are
now. They preserved all their rural simplicity, baited buffalo-calves
in the main squares, and had songs and sayings in order to enrage
one another. The villas scattered about the villages were large
rambling old shells of houses, and Aunt G. could not open her
eyes sufficiently wide when she saw what an Italian villa really was.
The bathing was delightful; break-neck paths led down the rocks to
little sheltered bays with the yellowest of sands, and the bluest of
waters, and old smugglers' caves, which gave the coolest shelter after
long dips in the tepid seas. There was an immense variety of
excursion. At the root of the tongue arose the Mountain of St.
Angelo, where the snow harvest, lasting during summer, was one
perpetual merry-making. There were boating trips to Ischia, to
Procida, to romantic Capri, with its blue grotto and purple figs, to
decayed Salerno, the splendid ruin, and to the temples of Pæstum,
more splendid still. The shooting was excellent during the quail
season; tall poles and immense nets formed a <i>chevaux de frise</i> on
the hilltops, but the boys went to windwards, and shot the birds
before they were trapped in the nets, in the usual ignoble way. In
fact, nothing could be more pleasant than Sorrento in its old and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
uncivilized days. Amongst the amusements at Sorrento, we indulged
ourselves with creeping over the Natural Arch, simply because the
Italians said, "Ma non è possibile, Signorini." It was a dangerous
proceeding, as the crumbling stone was ready at every moment to
give way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Classical_Games"></a>Classical Games.</i></div>

<p>Amongst other classical fads, we boys determined to imitate
Anacreon and Horace. We crowned ourselves with myrtle and
roses, chose the prettiest part of the garden, and caroused upon the
best wine we could afford, out of cups, disdaining to use glasses.
Our father, aware of this proceeding, gave us three bottles of sherry,
upon the principle that the grocer opens to the young shopboy his
drawers of figs and raisins. But we easily guessed the meaning of
the kind present, and contented ourselves with drinking each half a
bottle a day, as long as it lasted, and then asked for more, to the
great disgust of the donor. We diligently practised pistol-shooting,
and delighted in cock-fighting, at which the tutor duly attended.
Of course the birds fought without steel, but it was a fine game-breed,
probably introduced of old by the Spaniards. It not a little
resembles the Derby game-cock, which has spread itself half over
South America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Chess"></a>Chess.</i></div>

<p>There was naturally little variety in amusements. The few
English families lived in scattered villas. Old Mrs. Starke, Queen
of Sorrento, as she loved to be called, and the authoress of the
guide book, was the local "lion," and she was sketched and caricatured
in every possible way in her old Meg Merrilies' cloak. Game
to the last, she died on the road travelling. An Englishman, named
Sparkes, threw himself into one of the jagged volcanic ravines that
seam the tongue of Sorrento; but there is hardly a place in Italy,
high or low, where some Englishman has not suicided himself. A
painter, a Mr. Inskip, brought over an introduction, and was very
tipsy before dinner was half over. The Marsala wine supplied by
Iggulden &amp; Co. would have floored Polyphemus. The want of
excitement out of doors, produced a correspondent increase of it
inside. We were getting too old to be manageable, and Mr. Du Pré
taking high grounds on one occasion, very nearly received a good
thrashing. My father being a man of active mind, and having nothing
in the world to do, began to be unpleasantly chemical; he bought
Parke's "Catechism;" filled the house with abominations of all kinds,
made a hideous substance that he called soap, and prepared a
quantity of filth that he called citric acid, for which he spoiled
thousands of lemons. When his fit passed over it was succeeded
by one of chess, and the whole family were bitten by it. Every
spare hour, especially in the evening, was given to check and checkmating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and I soon learned to play one, and then two games, with
my eyes blindfolded. I had the sense, however, to give it up completely,
for my days were full of Philidor, and my dreams were of
gambits all night.</p>

<p>The dull life was interrupted by a visit from Aunt G. She
brought with her a Miss Morgan, who had been governess to the
three sisters, and still remained their friend. She was a woman of
good family in Cornwall, but was compelled, through loss of fortune,
to take service.</p>

<p>Miss Morgan was very proud of her nephew, the Rev. Morgan
Cowie, who was senior Wrangler at Cambridge. He had had the
advantage of studying mathematics in Belgium, where in those days
the entering examination of a College was almost as severe as the
passing examination of an English College. She was also very well
read, and she did not a little good in the house. She was the only
one who ever spoke to us children as if we were reasonable beings,
instead of scolding and threatening with the usual parental brutality
of <i>those days</i>. That unwise saying of the wise man, "Spare the
rod and spoil the child," has probably done more harm to the junior
world than any other axiom of the same size, and it is only of late
years that people have begun to "spoil the rod and spare the child."
So Miss Morgan could do with the juniors what all the rest of the
house completely failed in doing. The only thing that was puzzling
about her was, that she could not play at Chess. Aunt G. waxed
warm in defence of her friend, and assured the scoffers that "Morgan,
with her fine mind, would easily learn to beat the whole party."
"Fine mind!" said the scoffers. "Why, we would give her a
Queen."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Naples"></a>Naples.</i></div>

<p>Naples after Sorrento was a Paris. In those days it was an
exceedingly pleasant City, famous as it always has been for some of
the best cooks in Italy. The houses were good, and the servants
and the provisions were moderate. The Court was exceedingly
gay, and my father found a cousin there, old Colonel Burke, who
was so intimate with the King, known as "Old Bomba," as to be
admitted to his bedroom. There was also another Irish cousin, a
certain Mrs. Phayre, who for many years had acted duenna to the
Miss Smiths (Penelope and Gertrude). Penelope had always distinguished
herself in Paris by mounting wild horses in the Bois de
Boulogne, which ran away with her, and shook her magnificent hair
loose. She became a favourite at the Court of Naples, and amused
the dull royalties with her wild Irish tricks. It is said that, on one
occasion, she came up with a lift instead of the expected <i>vol au vent</i>,
or pudding. She ended by marrying the Prince of Capua, greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to the delight of the King, who found an opportunity of getting rid
of his brother, and put an end to certain scandals. It was said that
the amiable young Prince once shot an old man, whom he found
gathering sticks in his grounds, and on another occasion that he
was soundly thrashed by a party of English grooms, whom he had
insulted in his cups. The happy pair had just run away and concluded
the "triple alliance," as it was called (this is a marriage in
three different ways, in order to make sure of it; Protestant,
Catholic, and Civil), when our family settled in Naples, and they
found Mrs. Phayre and Gertrude Smith, the other sister, in uncomfortable
State, banished by the Court, and harassed by the
police. All their letters had been stopped at the post-office, and
they had had no news from home for months. My father saw them
carefully off to England, where Gertrude, who had a very plain face
and a very handsome figure, presently married the rich old Lord
Dinorben. Poor Miss Morgan also suffered considerably at Naples
from the stoppage of all her letters; she being supposed at least
to be a sister of Lady Morgan, the "wild Irish girl," whose writings
at that time had considerably offended the Italian Court.</p>

<p>Naples was perhaps the least strict of all the Italian cities, and
consequently it contained a colony, presided over by the Hon.
Mrs. Temple, Lady Eleanor Butler, Lady Strachan, and Berkeley
Craven, who would somewhat have startled the proprieties of another
place. The good-natured Minister was the Hon. Mr. Temple, Lord
Palmerston's brother, who cared nothing for a man's catechism provided
he kept decently clear of scandal. The Secretary of Legation
was a Mr. Kennedy, who married a Miss Briggs, and died early.
These were great friends of the family. On the other hand, the
Consul, Captain Galway, R.N., was anything but pleasant. He was
in a perpetual state of rile because his Consular service prevented
his being received at Court; moreover, he heard (possibly correctly)
that Mrs. Phayre and her two <i>protégées</i> were trying to put Colonel
Burton in his place. He was also much troubled by his family, and
one of them (the parson) especially troubled him. This gentleman
having neglected to provide for a young Galway whose mamma he
had neglected to marry, the maternal parent took a position outside
the church, and as the congregation streamed out, cried in a loud
voice, pointing to the curate, "Him the father of my child." Another
element of confusion at Naples was poor Charley Savile, Lord
Mexborough's son, who had quarrelled himself out of the Persian
Legation. He was a good hand with his sword, always ready to
fight, and equally ready to write. He always denied that he had
written and sent about some verses which all Naples attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
him, and they were certainly most scandalous. Of one lady he
wrote&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Society courts her, wicked old sinner,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet what won't man do for the sake of a dinner?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of another he wrote&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">"You look so demure, ma'am,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">So pious, so calm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Always chanting a hymn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Or singing a psalm.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet your thoughts are on virtue and heav'n no more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than the man in the moon&mdash;you dreadful young bore."</span><br />
</p>

<p>This pasquinade led to some half-dozen challenges and duels.
It was severe, but not worse than society deserved. Naples has
never been strict; and about the forties it was, perhaps, the most
dissolute City on the Continent. The natives were bad, but the
English visitors were worse. In fact, in some cases their morals
were unspeakable.</p>

<p>There was a charming family of the name of Oldham. The father,
when an English officer serving in Sicily, had married one of the
beauties of the island, a woman of high family and graceful as a
Spaniard. The children followed suit. The girls were beautiful,
and the two sons were upwards of six feet in height, and were
as handsome men as could well be seen. They both entered the
army. One, in the 2nd Queen's, was tortured to death by the
Kaffirs when his cowardly soldiers ran away, and left him wounded.
The other, after serving in the 86th in India, was killed in the light
cavalry charge of Balakalava. The families became great friends,
and I met them both in India.</p>

<p>Naples was a great place for excursions. To the north you had
Ischia and the Solfatara, a miniature bit of Vulcanism somewhat
like the Geyser ground in Iceland, where ignoramuses thought themselves
in the midst of untold volcanic grandeur. Nothing could be
more snobbish than the visit to the Grotto del Cane, where a wretched
dog was kept for the purpose of being suffocated half a dozen times
a day. There I was determined to act dog, and was pulled up only
in time to prevent being thoroughly asphyxiated. The Baths of Nero
are about equal to an average Turkish <i>Hammám</i>, but nothing more.
To the south the excursions were far more interesting.</p>

<p>Beyond Herculaneum, dark and dingy, lay Pompeii, in those days
very different from the tame Crystal Palace affair that it is now.
You engaged a cicerone as best you could; you had nothing to
pay because there were no gates; you picked up what you liked, in
shapes of bits of mosaic, and, if you were a swell, a house or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
street was opened up in your honour. And overlaying Pompeii
stood Vesuvius, which was considered prime fun. The walking up
the ash cone amongst a lot of seniors, old men dragged up by
<i>lazzaroni</i>, and old women carried up in baskets upon <i>lazzaroni's</i>
backs, was funny enough, but the descent was glorious. What took
you twenty minutes to go up took four minutes to go down. Imagine
a dustbin magnified to ten thousand, and tilted up at an angle of
thirty-five degrees; in the descent you plunged with the legs to the
knees, you could not manage to fall unless you hit a stone, and,
arrived at the bottom, you could only feel incredulous that it was
possible to run at such a rate. We caused no end of trouble, and
I was found privily attempting to climb down the crater, because
I had heard that an Englishman had been let down in a basket.
Many of these ascents were made; on one occasion during an
eruption, when the lava flowed down to the sea, and the Neapolitans
with long pincers were snatching pieces out of it to stamp and sell,
we boys, to the horror of all around, jumped on the top of the
blackening fire stream, burnt our boots, and vilely abused all those
who would not join us.</p>

<p>At Naples more was added to the work of education. Caraccioli,
the celebrated marine painter, was engaged to teach oil-painting;
but he was a funny fellow, and the hours which should have been
spent in exhausting palettes passed in pencil-caricaturing of every
possible friend and acquaintance. The celebrated Cavalli was the
fencing-master; and in those days the Neapolitan school, which
has now almost died out, was in its last bloom. It was a thoroughly
business-like affair, and rejected all the elegances of the French
school; and whenever there was a duel between a Neapolitan and
a Frenchman, the former was sure to win. We boys worked at it
heart and soul, and generally managed to give four hours a day to
it. I determined, even at that time, to produce a combination
between the Neapolitan and the French school, so as to supplement
the defects of the one by the merits of the other. A life of very
hard work did not allow me any leisure to carry out my plan; but
the man of perseverance stores up his resolve, and waits for any
number of years till he sees the time to carry it out. The plan was
made in 1836, and was completed in 1880 (forty-four years).<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>My father spared no pains or expense in educating his children.
He had entered the army at a very early age. Volunteers were
called for in Ireland, and those who brought a certain number into
the field received commissions gratis. The old Grandmamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Burton's tenants' sons volunteered by the dozen. They formed a
very fair company, and accompanied the young master to the wars;
and when the young master got his commission, they all, with the
exception of one or two, levanted, bolted, and deserted. Thus my
father found himself an officer at the age of seventeen, when he
ought to have been at school; and recognizing the deficiencies of his
own education, he was determined that his children should complain
of nothing of the kind. He was equally determined they none of
them should enter the army; the consequence being that both the
sons became soldiers, and the only daughter married a soldier.
Some evil spirit, probably Mr. Du Pré, whispered that the best plan
for the boys would be to send them to Oxford, in order that they
might rise by literature, an idea which they both thoroughly detested.
However, in order to crush their pride, they were told that they
should enter "Oxford College as sizars, poor gentlemen who are
supported by the alms of the others." Our feelings may be imagined.
We determined to enlist, or go before the mast, or to turn Turks,
banditti, or pirates, rather than undergo such an indignity.</p>

<p>Parthenope was very beautiful; but so true is English blood, that
the most remarkable part of it was "Pickwick," who happened to make
his way there at the time of the sojourn of our family. We read
with delight the description of the English home. We passed our
nights, as well as our days, devouring the book, and even "Ettore
Fieramosca" and the other triumphs of Massimo d'Azelio were
mere outsiders compared with it; but how different the effect of the
two books&mdash;"Pickwick," the good-humoured caricature of a boy full
of liquor and good spirits, and the "Disfida di Barletta," one of the
foundation-stones of Italian independence.</p>

<p>At last the house on the Chiaja was given up, and the family took
a house inside the City for a short time. The father was getting
tired and thinking of starting northwards. The change was afflicting.
The loss of the view of the Bay was a misfortune. The only amusement
was prospecting the streets, where the most extraordinary
scenes took place. It was impossible to forget a beastly Englishman,
as he stood eating a squirting orange surrounded by a string
of gutter-boys. The dexterity of the pickpockets, too, gave scenes
as amusing as a theatre. It was related of one of the Coryphæi
that he had betted with a friend that he would take the pocket-handkerchief
of an Englishman, who had also betted that no man
born in Naples could pick his pocket. A pal walked up to the man
as he was promenading the streets, flower in button-hole, solemnly
spat on his cravat, and ran away. The principal, with thorough
Italian politeness, walked up to the outraged foreigner, drew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
pocket-handkerchief and proceeded to remove the stain, exhorted
the outraged one to keep the fugitive in sight, and in far less time
than it takes to tell, transferred the handkerchief to his own pocket,
and set out in pursuit of the <i>barbaro</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Cholera"></a>Cholera.</i></div>

<p>The <i>lazzaroni</i>, too, were a perpetual amusement. We learned to
eat maccaroni like them, and so far mastered their dialect, that we
could exchange chaff by the hour. In 1869 I found them all at
Monte Video and Buenos Ayres, dressed in <i>cacciatore</i> and swearing
"M'nnaccia l'anima tua;" they were impressed with a conviction
that I was myself a <i>lazzarone</i> in luck. The shady side of the
picture was the cholera. It caused a fearful destruction, and the
newspapers owned to 1300 a day, which meant say 2300. The
much-abused King behaved like a gentleman. The people had
determined that the cholera was poison, and doubtless many made
use of the opportunity to get rid of husbands and wives and other
inconvenient relationships; but when the mob proceeded to murder
the doctors, and to gather in the market square with drawn knives,
declaring that the Government had poisoned the provisions, the
King himself drove up in a phaeton and jumped out of it entirely
alone, told them to put up their ridiculous weapons, and to show
him where the poisoned provisions were, and, seating himself upon
a bench, ate as much as his stomach would contain. Even the
<i>lazzarone</i> were not proof against this heroism, and viva'd and cheered
him to his heart's content.</p>

<p>My brother and I had seen too much of cholera to be afraid of it.
We had passed through it in France, it had followed us to Siena
and Rome, and at Naples it only excited our curiosity. We persuaded
the Italian man-servant to assist us in a grand escapade. He
had procured us the necessary dress, and when the dead-carts passed
round in the dead of the night, we went the rounds with them as
some of the <i>croquemorts</i>. The visits to the pauper houses, where
the silence lay in the rooms, were anything but pleasant, and still less
the final disposal of the bodies. Outside Naples was a large plain,
pierced with pits, like the silos or underground granaries of Algeria
and North Africa. They were lined with stone, and the mouths
were covered with one big slab, just large enough to allow a corpse
to pass. Into these flesh-pots<a name="FNanchor_2_10" id="FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_10" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> were thrown the unfortunate bodies
of the poor, after being stripped of the rags which acted as their
winding-sheets. Black and rigid, they were thrown down the apertures
like so much rubbish, into the festering heap below, and the
decay caused a kind of lambent blue flame about the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
pit, which lit up a mass of human corruption, worthy to be described
by Dante.</p>

<p>Our escapades, which were frequent, were wild for strictly brought
up Protestant English boys&mdash;they would be nothing now, when
boys do so much worse&mdash;but there were others that were less
excusable. Behind the Chiaja dwelt a multitude of syrens, who
were naturally looked upon as the most beautiful of their sex. One
lady in particular responded to the various telegraphic signs made
to her from the flat terrace of the house, and we boys determined to
pay her a visit. Arming ourselves with carving-knives, which we
stuffed behind our girdles, we made our way jauntily into the
house, introduced ourselves, and being abundant in pocket-money,
offered to stand treat, as the phrase is, for the whole neighbourhood.
The orgie was tremendous, and we were only too lucky to get
home unhurt, before morning, when the Italian servant let us in.
The result was a correspondence, consisting in equal parts of pure
love on our side and extreme debauchery on the syrens'. These
letters, unfortunately, were found by our mother during one of her
Sunday visitations to our chambers. A tremendous commotion
was the result. Our father and his dog, Mr. Du Pré, proceeded to
condign punishment with the horsewhip; but we climbed up to the
tops of the chimneys, where the seniors could not follow us, and
refused to come down till the crime was condoned.</p>

<p>This little business disgusted our father of Naples, and he
resolved to repair to a pure moral air. Naples is a very different
place now; so is all the Italy frequented by travellers, and spoiled
by railways and officialdom.</p>

<p>In 1881 a distinguished officer, and a gentleman allied to Royalty,
wrote as follows: "You threw some doubts on the efficiency of the
Italian posts, and I believe you; I don't think I was ever so glad to
get home. At Malta it looks so clean after the filth of Naples. I
think Italy, the Italians, their manners, customs, and institutions,
more damnable every time I see them, and feel sure you will meet
with less annoyance during your travels on the Gold Coast, than I
met with coming through Italy. Trains crowded, unpunctual;
starvation, filth, incivility, and extortion at every step; and, were it
not that there are so many works of art and of interest to see, I doubt
if any one would care to visit the country a second time."</p>

<p>(Here is an account of a purchase made to transfer home.) "A small
table was packed in a little case, and firmly nailed down. At the
station they refused to let it go in the luggage van, unless it were
corded, <i>lest it might be opened en route</i>. The officials offered to
cord it for <i>bakshish</i>, which was paid, but the cord not put on. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cut open my leather bag, and tried to open my portmanteau, but
when I called this fact to the notice of the station-master at Rome,
he simply turned on his heel and declined to answer. At Naples
they opened the little case, because furniture was subject to octroi;
and, on leaving, the case was again inspected, lest it might contain
a picture (they were not allowed to leave the country)." It is no
longer the classical Italy of Landor, nor the romantic Italy of Leigh
Hunt, nor the ideal Italy of the Brownings, nor the spiritualized Italy
of George Eliot, nor the everyday Italy of Charles Lever. They
thought they were going to be everything when they changed
Masters, but they have only succeeded in making it a noisy, vulgar,
quarrelsome and contentious, arrogant, money-grasping Italy, and
the sooner it receives a sound drubbing from France or Austria
the better for it. It will then reform itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Marseille"></a>Marseille.</i></div>

<p>The family left Naples in the spring of 1836. The usual mountain
of baggage was packed in the enormous boxes of the period, and the
Custom House officers never even opened them, relying, as they
said&mdash;and did in those good old days&mdash;upon the word of an Englishman,
that they contained nothing contraband. How different from
the United Italy, where even the dressing-bag is rummaged to find
a few cigars, or an ounce of coffee. The voyage was full of discomforts.
My mother, after a campaign of two or three years, had
been persuaded to part with her French maid Eulalie, an old and
attached servant, who made our hours bitter, and our faces yellow.
The steamer of the day was by no means a floating palace, especially
the English coasting steamers, which infested the Mediterranean.
The machinery was noisy and offensive. The cabins were dog-holes,
with a pestiferous atmosphere, and the food consisted of greasy
butter, bread which might be called dough, eggs with a perfume,
rusty bacon, milkless tea and coffee, that might be mistaken for each
other, waxy potatoes, graveolent greens <i>cuite à l'eau</i>, stickjaw pudding,
and cannibal haunches of meat, charred without, and blue within.</p>

<p>The only advantage was that the vessels were manned by English
crews, and in those days the British sailor was not a tailor, and he
showed his value when danger was greatest.</p>

<p>We steamed northwards in a good old way, puffing and panting,
pitching and rolling, and in due time made Marseille.</p>

<p>The town of the Canebière was far from being the splendid City
that it is now, but it always had one great advantage, that of being in
Provence. I always had a particular propensity for this bit of Africa
in Europe, and in after life in India for years, my greatest friend,
Dr. Steinhaüser, and myself indulged in visions of a country cottage,
where we would pass our days in hammocks, and our nights in bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and never admit books or papers, pens or ink, letters or telegrams.
This retreat was intended to be a rest for middle age, in order to
prepare for senility and second childhood. But this vision passed into
the limbo of things imagined (in fact, the vision of two hard-working
and overworked men), and I little thought that at fifty-five I should be
a married man, still in service, still knocking about the world, working
hard with my wife, and poor Steinhaüser dead fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>To return. However agreeable Provence was, the change from
Italians to French was not pleasant. The subjects of Louis Philippe,
the Citizen-King, were rancorous against Englishmen, and whenever
a fellow wanted to get up a row he had only to cry out, "These are
the <i>misérables</i> who poisoned Napoleon at St. Helena." This pleasant
little scene occurred on board a coasting steamer, between Marseille
and Cette, when remonstrance was made with the cheating steward,
backed by the rascally captain. Cette was beginning to be famous
for the imitation wines composed by the ingenuity of Monsieur
Guizot, brother of the <i>austère intrigant</i>. He could turn out any
wine, from the cheapest Marsala to the choicest Madeiran Bual.</p>

<p>But he did his counterfeiting honestly, as a little "G" was always
branded on the bottom of the cork, and Cette gave a good lesson
about ordering wines at hotels. The sensible traveller, when in a
strange place, always calls for the <i>carte</i>, and chooses the cheapest;
he knows by sad experience, by cramp and acidity of stomach, that
the dearest wines are often worse than the cheapest, and at best
that they are the same with different labels. The proprietor of the
hotel at Cette, had charged his <i>dame de comptoir</i> with robbing the
till. She could not deny it, but she replied with a <i>tu quoque</i>: "If
I robbed you I only returned tit for tat. You have been robbing
the public for the last quarter of a century, and only the other day
you brought a bottle of ordinaire and <i>escamoté'd</i> it into sixteen kinds
of <i>vins fin</i>." The landlord thought it better to drop the proceedings.
From Cette we travelled in hired carriages (as Dobbin and the
carriages had been sold at Naples) to Toulouse. We stayed at
Toulouse for a week, and I was so delighted with student life there,
that I asked my father's leave to join them. But he was always
determined on the Fellowship at Oxford. Our parents periodically
fell ill with asthma, and we young ones availed ourselves of the
occasion, by wandering far and wide over the country. We delighted
in these journeys, for though the tutor was there, the books were in
the boxes. My chief remembrances of Toulouse were, finding the
mistress of the hotel correcting her teeth with <i>table d'hôte</i> forks,
and being placed opposite the model Englishman of Alexandre
Dumas and Eugène Sue. The man's face never faded from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
memory. Carroty hair, white and very smooth forehead, green
eyes, a purple-reddish lower face, whiskers that had a kind of
crimson tinge, and an enormous mouth worn open, so as to show
the protruding teeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Pau_Bagnieres_de_Bigorres"></a>Pau&mdash;Bagnières de Bigorres.</i></div>

<p>In due time we reached Pau in the Pyrenees, the capital of the
Basses Pyrénées, and the old Bearnais. The little town on the
Gave de Pau was no summer place. The heats are intense, and all
who can, rush off to the Pyrénées, which are in sight, and distant
only forty miles. Our family followed suit, and went off to Bagnières
de Bigorres, where we hired a nice house in the main Square. There
were few foreigners in the Bagnières de Bigorres; it was at that time
a thoroughly French watering-place. It was invaded by a mob of
Parisians of both sexes, the men dressed in fancy costumes intended
to be "truly rural," and capped with Basque bonnets, white or red.
The women were more wonderful still, especially when on horseback;
somehow or other the Française never dons a riding-habit
without some solecism. Picnics were the order of the day, and they
were organized on a large scale, looking more like a squadron of
cavalry going out for exercise than a party of pleasure. We boys
obtained permission to accompany one of those caravans to the
Brêche de Roland, a nick in the mountain top clearly visible from
the plains, and supposed to have been cut by the good sword
"Joyeuse."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Contrabandistas"></a>Contrabandistas.</i></div>

<p>Here we boys were mightily taken with, and tempted to accept
the offer made to us by, a merry party of <i>contrabandistas</i>, who were
smuggling to and fro chocolate, tobacco, and <i>aguardienta</i> (spirits).
Nothing could be jollier than such a life as these people lead. They
travelled <i>au clair de la lune</i>, armed to the teeth; when they arrived
at the hotels the mules were unloaded and turned out to grass, the
guitar, played <i>à la Figaro</i>, began to tinkle, and all the young women,
like "the Buffalo girls," came out to dance. Wine and spirits flowed
freely, the greatest good humour prevailed, and the festivities were
broken only sometimes by "knifing or shooting."</p>

<p>We also visited Tarbes, which even in those days was beginning
to acquire a reputation for "le shport;" it presently became one of
the centres of racing and hunting in France, for which the excellent
climate and the fine rolling country admirably adapted it. It was
no wonder that the young French horse beat the English at the
same age. In the Basque Pyrénées a colt two years old is as well
grown as a Newmarket weed at two and a half.</p>

<p>When the great heat was over, the family returned to Pau, where
they found a good house over the arcade in the Place Gramont.
Pau boasts of being the birthplace of Henry IV., Gaston de Foix,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and Bernadotte. Strangers go through the usual routine of visiting
the Castle, called after the Protestant-Catholic King, Henry IV.;
driving to Ortez, where Marshal Soult fought unjustifiably the last
action of the Peninsular War; and of wandering about the flat,
moor-like <i>landes</i>, which not a little resemble those about Bordeaux.
The society at Pau was an improvement upon that of Naples.
The most remarkable person was Captain (R.N.) Lord William
Paget, who was living with his mother-in-law (Baroness de Rothenberg),
and his wife and children, and enjoying himself as usual.
Though even impecunious, he was the best of boon companions,
and a man generally loved. But he could also make himself feared,
and, as the phrase is, would stand no nonsense. He had a little
affair with a man whom we will call Robinson, and as they were
going to the meeting-place he said to his second, "What's the
fellow's pet pursuit?" "Well!" answered the other, "I don't know&mdash;but,
let me see&mdash;ah, I remember, a capital hand at waltzing."
"Waltzing!" said Lord William, and hit him accurately on the hip-bone,
which spoilt his saltations for many a long month. Years and
years after, when both were middle-aged men, I met at Shepherd's
Hotel, Cairo, his son, the boy whom I remembered straddling across
a diminutive donkey&mdash;General Billy Paget. He had also entered
the Anglo-Indian army, and amongst other things had distinguished
himself by getting the better (in an official correspondence) of
General John Jacob, the most obstinate and rancorous of men.
"Billy" had come out to Egypt with the intention of returning to
India, but the Red Sea looked so sweltering hot and its shores so
disgustingly barren, that he wrote to Aden to recall his luggage,
which had been sent forward, then and there retired from the
service, married a charming woman, and gave his old friends a very
excellent dinner in London.</p>

<p>There were also some very nice L'Estranges, one of the
daughters a very handsome woman, some pretty Foxes, an old
Captain Sheridan, with two good-looking daughters, and the
Ruxtons, whom we afterwards met at Pisa and the Baths of Lucca.
Certain elderly maidens of the name of Shannon lived in a house
almost overhanging the Gave de Pau. Upon this subject O'Connell,
the Agitator, produced a <i>bon mot</i>, which is, however, not fit for the
drawing-room. Pau was still a kind of invalid colony for consumptives,
although the native proverb about its climate is, "that it has
eight months winter, and four of the Inferno." Dr. Diaforus acts
upon the very intelligible system of self-interest. He does not wish
his patients to die upon his hands, and consequently he sends them
to die abroad. In the latter part of the last century he sent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
moribunds to Lisbon and to Montpellier, where the <i>vent de bise</i> is as
terrible as a black east wind is in Harwich.</p>

<p>Then he packed them off to Pisa, where the tropics and Norway
meet, and to damp, muggy, reeking Madeira, where patients have
lived a quarter of a century with half a lung, but where their sound
companions and nurses suffer from every description of evil which
attend biliousness. They then found out that the dry heat of
Teneriffe allowed invalids to be out after sunset, and, lastly, they
discovered that the dry cold of Canada and Iceland, charged with
ozone, offers the best chance of a complete cure. I proposed to
utilize the regions about the beautiful Dead Sea, about thirteen
hundred feet below the level of the Mediterranean, where oxygen
accumulates, and where, run as hard as you like, you can never be
out of breath. This will be the great Consumptive Hospital of
the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Pau_Education"></a>Pau Education.</i></div>

<p>At Pau the education went on merrily. I was provided with a
French master of mathematics, whose greasy hair swept the collar of
the <i>redingote</i> buttoned up to the chin. He was a type of his order.
He introduced mathematics everywhere. He was a red republican
of the reddest, hating rank and wealth, and he held that <i>Le Bon
Dieu</i> was not proven, because he could not express Him by a
mathematical formula, and he called his fellow-men <i>Bon-Dieusistes</i>.
We were now grown to lads, and began seriously to prepare for
thrashing our tutor, and diligently took lessons in boxing from the
Irish groom of a Captain Hutchinson, R.N. Whenever we could
escape from study we passed our hours in the barracks, fencing with
the soldiers, and delighting every <i>piou-piou</i> (recruit) by our powers
of consuming the country spirit (the white and unadulterated cognac).
We also took seriously to smoking, although, as usual with beginners
in those days, we suffered in the flesh. In the later generation, you
find young children, even girls, who, although their parents have
never smoked, can finish off a cigarette without the slightest inconvenience,
even for the first time.</p>

<p>Smoking and drinking led us, as it naturally does, into trouble.
There was a Jamaica Irishman with a very dark skin and a very
loud brogue, called Thomas, who was passing the winter for the
benefit of his chest at Pau. He delighted in encouraging us for
mischief sake. One raw snowy day he gave us his strongest cigars,
and brewed us a bowl of potent steaming punch, which was soon
followed by another. Edward, not being very well, was unusually
temperate, and so I, not liking to waste it, drank for two. A walk
was then maliciously proposed, and the cold air acted as usual as
stimulant to stimulant. Thomas began laughing aloud, Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
plodded gloomily along, and I got into half a dozen scrimmages
with the country people. At last matters began to look serious, and
the too hospitable host took his two guests back to their home. I
managed to stagger upstairs; I was deadly pale, with staring eyes,
and compelled to use the depressed walk of a monkey, when I met
my mother. She was startled at my appearance, and as I pleaded
very sick she put me to bed. But other symptoms puzzled her. She
fetched my father, who came to the bedside, looked carefully for a
minute at his son and heir, and turned upon his heel, exclaiming,
"The beast's in liquor." The mother burst into a flood of tears,
and next morning presented me with a five-franc piece, making me
promise to be good for the future, and not to read Lord Chesterfield's
"Letters to his Son," of which she had a dreadful horror. It need
hardly be said that the five francs soon melted away in laying in a
stock of what is popularly called "a hair of the dog that bit."</p>

<p>What we learnt last at Pau was the Bearnais dialect. It is a
charmingly naïve dialect, mixture of French, Spanish, and Provençale,
and containing a quantity of pretty, pleasant songs. The
country folk were delighted when addressed in their own lingo. It
considerably assisted me in learning Provençale, the language of Le
Geysaber; and I found it useful in the most out-of-the-way corners
of the world, even in Brazil. Nothing goes home to the heart of a
man so much as to speak to him in his own <i>patois</i>. Even a Lancashire
lad can scarcely resist the language of "Tummas and Mary."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Argeles"></a>Argélés.</i></div>

<p>At length the wheezy, windy, rainy, foggy, sleety, snowy winter
passed away, and the approach of the warm four months, warned
strangers to betake themselves to the hills. This time the chosen
place was Argélés. In those days it was a little village, composed
mainly of one street, not unlike mining Arrayal in Brazil, or a negro
village on the banks of the Gaboon. But the scenery around it was
beautiful. It lay upon a brawling stream, and the contrast of the
horizontal meadow-lands around it, with the backing of almost
vertical hills and peaks, thoroughly satisfied the eye. It had
cruel weather in winter time, and a sad accident had just happened.
A discharged soldier had reached it in midwinter, when the
snow lay deep and the wolves were out, and the villagers strongly
dissuaded him from trying to reach his father's home in the hills.
He was armed with his little <i>briquet</i>, the little curved sword then
carried by the French infantry soldiers, and he laughed all caution
to scorn. It was towards nightfall; he had hardly walked a mile,
before a pack came down upon him, raging and ravening with hunger.
He put his back to a tree, and defended himself manfully, killing
several wolves, and escaped whilst the carcases were being devoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by their companions; but he sheathed his sword without taking the
precaution to wipe it, and when he was attacked again it was glued
to the scabbard. The wolves paid dearly for their meal, for the
enraged villagers organized a battue, and killed about a score of
them as an expiatory sacrifice for the poor soldier.</p>

<p>We two brothers, abetted by our tutor, had fallen into the detestable
practice of keeping our hands in by shooting swifts and swallows,
of which barbarity we were afterwards heartily ashamed. Our first
lesson was from the peasants. On one occasion, having shot a
harmless bird that fell among the reapers, the latter charged us in
a body, and being armed with scythes and sickles, caused a precipitous
retreat. In those days the swallow seemed to be a kind of
holy bird in the Bearnais, somewhat like the pigeons of Mecca and
Venice. I can only remember that this was the case with old
Assyrians and Aramæans, who called the swift or devilling the
destiny, or foretelling bird, because it heralded the spring.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Boys_fall_in_Love"></a>The Boys fall in Love.</i></div>

<p>There was a small society at Argélés, consisting chiefly of English
and Spaniards. The latter were mostly refugees, driven away from
home by political changes. They were not overburdened with
money, and of course looked for cheap quarters. They seemed
chiefly to live upon chocolate, which they made in their own way,
in tiny cups so thick and gruelly, that sponge-cake stood upright in
it. They smoked cigarettes with maize-leaf for paper, as only a
Spaniard can. The little cylinder hangs down as if it were glued
to the smoker's lower lip. He goes on talking and laughing, and
then, by some curious movement of a muscle developed in no other
race, he raises the weed to the horizontal and puffs out a cloud
of smoke. They passed their spare time in playing the guitar and
singing party songs, and were very much disgusted when asked to
indulge the company with Riego el Cid. There was a marriage at
Argélés, when a Scotch maiden of mature age married M. Le Maire,
an old French <i>mousquetaire</i>, a man of birth, of courtly manners, and
who was the delight of the young ones, but his <i>plaisanteries</i> are utterly
unfit for the drawing-room. There was also a Baron de Meydell, his
wife, her sister, and two very handsome daughters. The eldest was
engaged to a rich young planter in the Isle of Bourbon. We two
lads of course fell desperately in love with them, and the old father,
who had served in the Hessian Brigade in the English army, only
roared with laughter when he saw and heard our <i>polissoneries</i>. The
old man liked us both, and delighted in nothing more than to see
us working upon each other with foil and sabre. The parting of the
four lovers was something very sad, and three of us at least shed
tears. The eldest girl was beyond such childishness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>As the mountain fog began to roll down upon the valley, our father
found that his poor chest required a warmer climate. This time we
travelled down the Grand Canal du Midi in a big public barge, which
resembled a Dutch <i>trekschuyt</i>. At first, passing through the locks
was a perpetual excitement, but this very soon palled. The
L'Estranges were also on board, and the French part of the company
were not particularly pleasant. They were mostly tourists returning
home, mixed with a fair proportion of <i>commis-voyageurs</i>, a class that
corresponds with, but does not resemble, our commercial traveller.
The French species seems to have but two objects in social life: first,
to glorify himself, and secondly, to glorify Paris.</p>

<p>Monsieur Victor Hugo has carried the latter mania to the very
verge of madness, and left to his countrymen an example almost as
bad as bad can be. The peculiarity of the <i>commis-voyageur</i> in those
days, was the queer thin varnish of politeness, which he thought it
due to himself to assume. He would help himself at breakfast or
dinner to the leg, wing, and part of the breast, and pass the dish to
his neighbour when it contained only a neck and a drumstick, with a
pleased smile and a ready bow, anxiously asking "Madame, veut elle
de la volaille?" and he was frightfully unprogressive. He wished to
"let sleeping dogs lie," and hated to move quiet things. It almost
gave him an indigestion to speak of railways. He found the diligence
and the canal boat quite fast enough for his purpose. And
in this to a certain extent he represented the Genius of the Nation.</p>

<p>With the excellent example of the Grand Canal du Midi before
them, the French have allowed half a century to pass before they even
realized the fact that their rivers give them most admirable opportunities
for inland navigation, and that by energy in spending money
they could have a water line leading up from Manches to Paris, and
down from Paris to the Mediterranean. In these days of piercing
isthmuses, they seem hardly to have thought of a canal that would
save the time and expense of running round Spain and Portugal,
when it would be so easy to cut the neck that connects their country
with the Peninsula. The rest of the journey was eventless as usual.
The family took the steamer at Marseille, steamed down to Leghorn,
and drove up to Pisa. There they found a house on the south side of
the Lung' Arno, belonging to a widow of the name of Pini. It was
a dull and melancholy place enough, but it had the advantage of a
large garden that grew chiefly cabbages. It was something like a
return home; a number of old acquaintances were met, and few new
ones were made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Drawing"></a>Drawing.</i></div>

<p>The studies were kept up with unremitting attention. I kept up
drawing, painting, and classics, and it was lucky for me that I did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
I have been able to make my own drawings, and to illustrate my own
books. It is only in this way that a correct idea of unfamiliar scenes
can be given. Travellers who bring home a few scrawls and put
them into the hands of a professional illustrator, have the pleasure of
seeing the illustrated paper style applied to the scenery and the
people of Central Africa and Central Asia and Europe. Even when
the drawings are carefully done by the traveller-artist, it is hard to
persuade the professional to preserve their peculiarities. For instance,
a sketch from Hyderabad, the inland capital of Sind, showed a number
of mast-like poles which induced the English artist to write out and
ask if there ought not to be yards and sails. In sending a sketch
home of a pilgrim in his proper costume, the portable Korán worn
under the left arm narrowly escaped becoming a revolver. On the
chocolate-coloured cover of a book on Zanzibar, stands a negro in
gold, straddling like the Colossus of Rhodes. He was propped crane-like
upon one leg, supporting himself with his spear, and applying,
African fashion, the sole of the other foot to the perpendicular calf.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Music"></a>Music.</i></div>

<p>But music did not get on so well. We all three had good speaking
voices, but we sang with a "<i>voce di gola</i>," a throaty tone which was
terrible to hear. It is only in England that people sing without
voices. This may do very well when chirping a comic song, or half-speaking
a ballad, but in nothing higher. I longed to sing, began
singing with all my might at Pau in the Pyrenees, and I kept it up
at Pisa, where Signor Romani (Mario's old master) rather encouraged
me, instead of peremptorily or pathetically bidding me to hold my
tongue. I wasted time and money, and presently found out my
mistake and threw up music altogether. At stray times I took up
the flageolet, and other simple instruments, as though I had a kind
of instinctive feeling how useful music would be to me in later life.
And I never ceased to regret that I had not practised sufficiently,
to be able to write down music at hearing. Had I been able to do
so, I might have collected some two thousand motives from Europe,
Asia, Africa, and America, and have produced a musical note-book
which would have been useful to a Bellini, or Donizetti, or a
Boito.</p>

<p>We had now put away childish things; that is to say, we no longer
broke the windows across the river with slings, or engaged in free
fights with our coevals. But the climate of Italy is precocious, so,
as the Vicar of Wakefield has it, "we cocked our hats and loved the
ladies." And our poor father was once appalled by strange heads
being put out of the windows, in an unaccustomed street, and with
the words, "Oh! S'or Riccardo, Oh! S'or Edoardo."</p>

<p>Madame P&mdash;&mdash;, the landlady, had three children. Sandro, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
son, was a tall, gawky youth, who wore a <i>cacciatore</i> or Italian shooting-jacket
of cotton-leather, not unlike the English one made loose, with
the tails cut off. The two daughters were extremely handsome girls,
in very different styles. Signorina Caterina, the elder, was tall, slim,
and dark, with the palest possible complexion and regular features.
Signorina Antonia, the younger, could not boast of the same classical
lines, but the light brown hair, and the pink and white complexion,
made one forgive and forget every irregularity. Consequently I fell
in love with the elder, and Edward with the latter. Proposals of
marriage were made and accepted. The girls had heard that, in her
younger days, mamma had had half a dozen strings to her bow at the
same time, and they were perfectly ready to follow parental example.
But a serious obstacle occurred in the difficulty of getting the
ceremony performed. As in England there was a popular but
mistaken idea that a man could put a rope round his wife's neck,
take her to market, and sell her like a quadruped, so there was, and
perhaps there is still, in Italy, a legend that any affianced couple
standing up together in front of the congregation during the elevation
of the Host, and declaring themselves man and wife, are very
much married. Many inquiries were made about this procedure, and
at one time it was seriously intended. But the result of questioning
was, that <i>promessi sposi</i> so acting, are at once imprisoned and punished
by being kept in separate cells, and therefore it became evident, that
the game was not worth the candle. This is like a Scotch marriage,
however&mdash;with the Italian would be binding in religion, and the
Scotch in law.</p>

<p>Edward and I made acquaintance with a lot of Italian medical
students, compared with whom, English men of the same category
were as babes, and they did us no particular good. At last the
winter at Pisa ended, badly&mdash;very badly. The hard studies of
the classics during the day, occasionally concluded with a revel at
night. On one hopeless occasion a bottle of Jamaica gin happened
to fall into the wrong hands. The revellers rose at midnight, boiled
water, procured sugar and lemons, and sat down to a steaming soup
tureen full of punch. Possibly it was followed by a second, but the
result was that they sallied out into the streets, determined upon
what is <i>called</i> a "spree." Knockers did not exist, and Charleys did
not confine themselves to their sentry-boxes, and it was vain to ring
at bells, when every one was sound asleep. Evidently the choice of
amusements was limited, and mostly confined to hustling inoffensive
passers-by. But as one of these feats had been performed, and cries
for assistance had been uttered, up came the watch at the double,
and the revellers had nothing to do but to make tracks. My legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
were the longest, and I escaped; Edward was seized and led off, despite
his fists and heels, ignobly to the local <i>violon</i>, or guard-house. One
may imagine my father's disgust next morning, when he was courteously
informed by the prison authorities that a <i>giovinotto</i> bearing his
name, had been lodged during the night at the public expense. The
father went off in a state of the stoniest severity to the guard-house,
and found the graceless one treating his companions in misfortune,
thieves and ruffians of every kind, to the contents of a pocket-flask
with which he had provided himself in case of need. This was the
last straw; our father determined to transfer his head-quarters to the
Baths of Lucca, and then to prepare for breaking up the family. The
adieux of Caterina and Antonia were heartrending, and it was agreed
to correspond every week. The journey occupied a short time, and
a house was soon found in the upper village of Lucca.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Baths_of_Lucca"></a>The Baths of Lucca.</i></div>

<p>In those days, the Lucchese baths were the only place in Italy
that could boast of a tolerably cool summer climate, and a few of
the comforts of life. Sorrento, Montenero, near Leghorn, and the
hills about Rome, were frequented by very few; they came under
the category of "cheap and nasty." Hence the Bagni collected what
was considered to be the distinguished society. It had its parson
from Pisa, even in the days before the travelling continental
clergyman was known, and this one migrated every year to the hills,
like the flight of swallows, and the beggars who desert the hot plains
and the stifling climate of the lowlands. There was generally at
least one English doctor who practised by the kindly sufferance of
the <i>then</i> Italian Government. The Duke of Lucca at times attended
the balls; he was married, but his gallant presence and knightly
manner committed terrible ravages in the hearts of susceptible
English girls.</p>

<p>The queen in ordinary was a Mrs. Colonel Stisted, as she called
herself, the "same Miss Clotilda Clotworthy Crawley who was" so
rudely treated by the wild Irish girl, Lady Morgan. I was also
obliged to settle an old score with her in after years in "Sinde, or
the Unhappy Valley." And so I wrote, "She indeed had left her
mark in literature, not by her maudlin volume, 'The Byeways of
Italy,' but by the abuse of her fellow authors." She was "the sea
goddess with tin ringlets and venerable limbs" of the irrepressible
Mrs. Trollope. She also supplied Lever with one of the characters
which he etched in with his most corrosive acid. In one season
the Baths collected Lady Blessington, Count D'Orsay, the charming
Lady Walpole, Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the poetess, whose
tight <i>sacque</i> of black silk gave us youngsters a series of caricatures.
There, too, was old Lady Osborne, full of Greek and Latin, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
married her daughter to Captain Bernal, afterwards Bernal Osborne.
Amongst the number was Mrs. Young, whose daughter became
Madame Matteucci, wife of the celebrated scientist and electrician of
Tuscany. She managed, curiously to say, to hold her own in her
new position. Finally, I remember Miss Virginia Gabriell, daughter
of old General Gabriell, commonly called the "Archangel Gabriel."
Virginia Gabriell, "all white and fresh, and virginally plain," afterwards
made a name in the musical world, composed beautiful
ballads, published many pieces, and married, and died in St. George's
Hospital by being thrown from a carriage, August 7, 1877. She
showed her <i>savoir faire</i> at the earliest age. At a ball given to the
Prince, all appeared in their finest dresses and richest jewellery. Miss
Virginia was in white, with a single necklace of pink coral. They
danced till daylight; and when the sun arose, Miss Virginia was
like a rose amongst faded dahlias and sunflowers.</p>

<p>There was a very nice fellow of the name of Wood, who had just
married a Miss Stisted, one of the nieces of the "Queen of the
Baths," with whom all the "baths" were in love. Another marking
young person was Miss Helen Crowley, a girl of the order "dashing,"
whose hair was the brightest auburn, and complexion the purest
white and red. Her father was the Rev. Dr. Crowley, whose Jewish
novel "Salathiel" made a small noise in the world; but either he or
his wife disliked children, so Miss Helen had been turned over to
the charge of aunts. These were two elderly maiden ladies, whose
agnosticism was of the severest description. "Sister, what is that
noise?" "The howling of hymns, sister." "The beastly creatures,"
cried she, as "Come across hill and dale" reached her most
irreverent ears. I met both of these ladies in later life, and it was
enough to say that all three had terribly changed.</p>

<p>Amongst the remarkable people we knew were the Desanges
family, who had a phenomenon in the house. A voice seemed
to come out of it of the very richest volume, and every one thought
it was a woman's. It really belonged to Master Louis, who afterwards
made for himself so great a name for battle-scenes (The
Desanges' Crimea and Victoria Cross Gallery) and also for portraits.<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The voice did not recover itself thoroughly after breaking,
but sufficient remained for admirable comic songs, and no man
who ever heard them came away from "Le Lor Maire" and
"Vilikens et sa Dinah" without aching sides. There was another
learned widow of the name of Graves, whose husband had been a
kinsman of my father. Her daughter prided herself upon the breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of her forehead and general intellectuality. She ended by marrying
the celebrated historian Von Ranke. Intellectual Englishwomen
used to expect a kind of intellectual paradise in marrying German
professors. They were to share their labours, assist in their discoveries,
and wear a kind of reflected halo or gloria, as the moon
receives light from the sun; but they were perfectly shocked when
they were ordered to the kitchen, and were addressed with perhaps
"Donner&mdash;Wetter&mdash;Sacrament" if the dinner was not properly
cooked.</p>

<p>These little colonies like the "Baths of Lucca" began to decline
about 1850, and came to their Nadir in 1870. Then they had a
kind of resurrection. The gambling in shares and stocks and loans
lost England an immense sum of money, and the losses were most
felt by that well-to-do part of the public that had a fixed income
and no chance of ever increasing it. The loss of some five hundred
millions of pounds sterling, rendered England too expensive for
a large class, and presently drove it abroad. It gained numbers in
1881, when the Irish Land Bill, soon to be followed by a corresponding
English Land Bill, exiled a multitude of landowners. So
the little English colonies, which had dwindled to the lowest expression,
gradually grew and grew, and became stronger than they
ever did.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Boys_get_too_Old_for_Home"></a>The Boys get too Old for Home.</i></div>

<p>It was evident that the Burton family was ripe for a break up.
Our father, like an Irishman, was perfectly happy as long as he was
the only man in the house, but the presence of younger males irritated
him. His temper became permanently soured. He could
no longer use the rod, but he could make himself very unpleasant
with his tongue. "Senti come me li rimangia quei poveri ragazzi!"
(Hear how he is chawing-up those poor lads!) said the old Pisan-Italian
lady's-maid, and I do think now that we were not pleasant
inmates of a household. We were in the "Sturm und drang" of the
teens. We had thoroughly mastered our tutor, threw our books
out of the window if he attempted to give a lesson in Greek or
Latin, and applied ourselves with ardour to Picault Le Brun, and
Paul de Kock, the "Promessi Sposi," and the "Disfida di Barletta."
Instead of taking country walks, we jodelled all about the hillsides
under the direction of a Swiss scamp. We shot pistols in every
direction, and whenever a stray fencing-master passed, we persuaded
him to give us a few hours of "point." We made experiments of
everything imaginable, including swallowing and smoking opium.</p>

<p>The break-up took place about the middle of summer. It was
comparatively tame. Italians marvelled at the Spartan nature of
the British mother, who, after the habits of fifteen years, can so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
easily part with her children at the cost of a lachrymose last embrace,
and watering her prandial beefsteak with tears. Amongst Italian
families, nothing is more common than for all the brothers and
sisters to swear that they will not marry if they are to be separated
from one another. And even now, in these subversive and progressive
days, what a curious contrast is the English and the Italian
household. Let me sketch one of the latter, a family belonging to
the old nobility, once lords of the land, and now simple proprietors
of a fair Estate. In a large garden, and a larger orchard of vines
and olives, stands a solid old house, as roomy as a barrack, but
without the slightest pretension of comfort or luxury. The old
Countess, a widow, has the whole of her progeny around her&mdash;two
or three stalwart sons, one married and the others partially so, and
a daughter who has not yet found a husband. The servants are old
family retainers. They consider themselves part and parcel of the
household; they are on the most familiar terms with the family,
although they would resent with the direst indignation the slightest
liberty on the part of outsiders. The day is one of extreme simplicity,
and some might even deem it monotonous. Each individual
leaves his bed at the hour he or she pleases, and finds coffee, milk,
and small rolls in the dining-room. Smoking and dawdling pass
the hours till almost mid-day, when <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i>, or rather
a young dinner, leads very naturally up to a siesta. In the afternoon
there is a little walking or driving, and even shooting in the case of
the most energetic. There is a supper after nightfall, and after that
dominoes or cards, or music, or conversazione, keep them awake for
half the night. The even tenor of their days is broken only by a
festival or a ball in the nearest town, or some pseudo Scientific
Congress in a City not wholly out of reach; and so things go on
from year to year, and all are happy because they look to nothing
else.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Schinznach_and_England"></a>Schinznach and England.</i></div>

<p>Our journey began in the early summer of 1840. My mother
and sister were left at the Baths of Lucca, and my father, with Mr.
Du Pré, and Edward and I, set out for Switzerland. We again
travelled <i>vetturino</i>, and we lads cast longing eyes at the charming
country which we were destined not to see again for another ten
years. How melancholy we felt when on our way to the chill and
dolorous North! At Schinznach I was left in charge of Mr. Du Pré,
while my father and brother set out for England direct. These
Hapsburg baths in the Aargau had been chosen because the
abominable sulphur water, as odorous as that of Harrogate, was
held as sovereign in skin complaints, and I was suffering from
exanthémata, an eruption brought on by a sudden check of perspiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
These eruptions are very hard to cure, and they often
embitter a man's life. The village consisted of a single Establishment,
in which all nationalities met. Amongst them was an
unfortunate Frenchman, who had been attacked at Calcutta with
what appeared to be a leprous taint. He had tried half a dozen
places to no purpose, and he had determined to blow his brains out
if Schinznach failed him. The only advantage of the place was, its
being within easy distance of Schaffhausen and the falls of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>When the six weeks' cure was over, I was hurried by my guardian
across France, and Southern England, to the rendezvous. The
Grandmother and the two aunts, finding Great Cumberland Place
too hot, had taken country quarters at Hampstead. Grandmamma
Baker received us lads with something like disappointment. She
would have been better contented had we been six feet high, bony
as Highland cattle, with freckled faces, and cheek-bones like horns.
Aunt Georgina Baker embraced and kissed her nephews with
effusion. She had not been long parted from us. Mrs. Frank
Burton, the other aunt, had not seen us for ten years, and of course
could not recognize us.</p>

<p>We found two very nice little girl-cousins, who assisted us to pass
the time. But the old dislike to our surroundings, returned with
redoubled violence. Everything appeared to us so small, so mean,
so ugly. The faces of the women were the only exception to the
general rule of hideousness. The houses were so unlike houses,
and more like the Nuremberg toys magnified. The outsides were
so prim, so priggish, so utterly unartistic. The little bits of garden
were mere slices, as if they had been sold by the inch. The interiors
were cut up into such wretched little rooms, more like ship-cabins
than what was called rooms in Italy. The drawing-rooms were
crowded with hideous little tables, that made it dangerous to pass
from one side to the other. The tables were heaped with nick-nacks,
that served neither for use or show. And there was a
desperate neatness and cleanness about everything that made us
remember the old story of the Stoic who spat in the face of the
master of the house because it was the most untidy place in the
dwelling.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Family_break_up"></a>The Family break up.</i></div>

<p>Then came a second parting. Edward was to be placed under
the charge of the Rev. Mr. Havergal, rector of some country parish.
Later on, he wrote to say that "Richard must not correspond with
his brother, as he had turned his name into a peculiar form of
ridicule." He was in the musical line, and delighted in organ-playing.
But Edward seemed to consider the whole affair a bore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and was only too happy when he could escape from the harmonious
parsonage.</p>

<p>In the mean time I had been tried and found wanting. One of
my father's sisters (Mrs. General D'Aguilar, as she called herself)
had returned from India, after an uninterrupted residence of a score
of years, with a large supply of children of both sexes. She had
settled herself temporarily at Cambridge, to superintend the education
of her eldest son, John Burton D'Aguilar, who was intended for the
Church, and who afterwards became a chaplain in the Bengal
Establishment. Amongst her many acquaintances was a certain
Professor Sholefield, a well-known Grecian. My father had rather
suspected that very little had been done in the house, in the way of
classical study, during the last two years. The Professor put me
through my paces in Virgil and Homer, and found me lamentably
deficient. I did not even know who Isis was! worse still, it was
found out that I, who spoke French and Italian and their dialects
like a native, who had a considerable smattering of Bearnais,
Spanish, and Provençale, barely knew the Lord's Prayer, broke
down in the Apostles' Creed, and had never heard of the Thirty-nine
Articles&mdash;a terrible revelation!</p>

<h4>OXFORD.</h4>


<p>As it was Long Vacation at Oxford, and I could not take rooms at
once in Trinity College, where my name had been put down, it was
necessary to place me somewhere out of mischief. At the intervention
of friends, a certain Doctor Greenhill agreed to lodge and
coach me till the opening term. The said doctor had just married
a relation of Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, and he had taken his bride to
Paris, in order to show her the world and to indulge himself in a
little dissecting. Meanwhile I was placed <i>pro tem.</i> with another
medical don, Dr. Ogle, and I enjoyed myself in that house. The
father was a genial man, and he had nice sons and pretty daughters.
As soon as Dr. Greenhill returned to his house in High Street,
Oxford, I was taken up there by my father, and was duly consigned
to the new tutor. Mr. Du Pré vanished, and was never seen again.</p>

<p>The first sight of Oxford struck me with a sense of appal. "O
Domus antiqua et religiosa," cried Queen Elizabeth, in 1664, standing
opposite Pembroke College, which the Dons desecrated in 1875.
I could not imagine how such fine massive and picturesque old
buildings as the colleges could be mixed up with the mean little
houses that clustered around them, looking as if they were built
of cardboard. In after days, I remembered the feeling, when looking
at the Temple of the Sun in Palmyra, surrounded by its Arab
huts, like swallows' nests planted upon a palace wall. And everything,
<i>except</i> the colleges, looked so mean.</p>

<p>The good old Mitre was, if not the only, at least the chief hostelry
of the place, and it had the outward and visible presence of a pot-house.
The river with the classical name of Isis, was a mere moat,
and its influent, the Cherwell, was a ditch. The country around,
especially just after Switzerland, looked flat and monotonous in the
extreme. The skies were brown-grey, and, to an Italian nose, the
smell of the coal smoke was a perpetual abomination. Queer beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
walked the streets, dressed in aprons that hung behind, from their
shoulders, and caps consisting of a square, like that of a lancer's
helmet, planted upon a semi-oval to contain the head. These
queer creatures were carefully shaved, except, perhaps, a diminutive
mutton-cutlet on each side of their face, and the most serious sort
were invariably dressed <i>in vestibus nigris aut sub fuscis</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, an indescribable appearance of donnishness or incipient
donnishness pervaded the whole lot. The juniors looked like schoolboys
who aspired to be schoolmasters, and the seniors as if their
aspirations had been successful. I asked after the famous Grove of
Trinity, where Charles I. used to walk when tired of Christ Church
meadows, and which the wits called Daphne. It had long been
felled, and the ground was covered with buildings.</p>

<p>At last term opened, and I transferred myself from Dr. Greenhill
to Trinity College.</p>

<p>Then my University life began, and readers must be prepared
not to be shocked at the recital of my college failures, which only
proves the truth of what I said before, that if a father means his
boy to succeed in an English career, he must put him to a preparatory
school, Eton or Oxford, educate him for his coming profession,
and not drag his family about the Continent, under governesses and
tutors, to learn fencing, languages, and become wild, and to belong
to nowhere in particular as to parish or county.</p>

<p>In the autumn term of 1840, at nineteen and a half, I began
residence in Trinity College, where my quarters were a pair of dog-holes,
called rooms, overlooking the garden of the Master of Balliol.
My reception at College was not pleasant. I had grown a splendid
moustache, which was the envy of all the boys abroad, and which all
the advice of Drs. Ogle and Greenhill failed to make me remove.
I declined to be shaved until formal orders were issued to the
authorities of the college. For I had already formed strong ideas
upon the Shaven age of England, when her history, with some
brilliant exceptions, such as Marlborough, Wellington, or Nelson,
was at its meanest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Practical_Jokes"></a>Practical Jokes.</i></div>

<p>As I passed through the entrance of the College, a couple of
brother collegians met me, and the taller one laughed in my face.
Accustomed to continental decorum, I handed him my card and
called him out. But the college lad, termed by courtesy an
Oxford man, had possibly read of duels, had probably never
touched a weapon, sword or pistol, and his astonishment at the
invitation exceeded all bounds. Explanations succeeded, and I
went my way sadly, and felt as if I had fallen amongst <i>épiciers</i>.
The college porter had kindly warned me against tricks played by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the older hands, upon "fresh young gentlemen," and strongly advised
me to "sport my oak," or, in other words, to bar and lock my outer
door. With dignity deeply hurt, I left the entrance wide open, and
thrust a poker into the fire, determined to give all intruders the
warmest possible reception. This was part and parcel of that
unhappy education abroad. In English public schools, boys learn
first "to take," and then "to give." They begin by being tossed,
and then by tossing others in the blanket. Those were days when
practical jokes were in full force. Happily it is now extinct. Every
greenhorn coming to college or joining a regiment, was liable to the
roughest possible treatment, and it was only by submitting with the
utmost good humour, that he won the affection of his comrades, and
was looked upon as a gentleman. But the practice also had its
darker phase. It ruined many a prospect, and it lost many a life.
The most amusing specimen that <i>I</i> ever saw was that of a charming
youngster, who died soon after joining his Sepoy regiment. The
oldsters tried to drink him under the table at mess, and had notably
failed. About midnight, when he was enjoying his first sleep, he
suddenly awoke and found a ring of spectral figures dancing round
between his bed and the tent-walls. After a minute's reflection, he
jumped up, seized a sheet, threw it over his shoulders, and joined
the dancers, saying, "If this is the fashion I suppose I must do it
also." The jokers, baffled a second time, could do nothing but knock
him down and run away.</p>

<p>The example of the larky Marquis of Waterford, seemed to
authorize all kinds of fantastic tricks. The legend was still fresh,
that he had painted the Dean of Christ Church's door red, because
that formidable dignitary had objected to his wearing "pink" in
High Street. Another, and far more inexcusable prank, was his
sending all the accoucheurs in the town, to the house of a middle-aged
maiden lady, whose father, a don, had offended him. In the
colleges they did not fly at such high game, but they cruelly worried
everything in the shape of a freshman. One unfortunate youth, a
fellow who had brought with him a dozen of home-made wine, elder
and cowslip, was made shockingly tight by brandy being mixed with
his port, and was put to bed with all his bottles disposed on different
parts of his person. Another, of æsthetic tastes, prided himself upon
his china, and found it next morning all strewed in pieces about
his bed. A third, with carroty whiskers, had them daubed with
mustard, also while in a state of insensibility, and had to have them
fall, yellow, next morning under a barber's hands.</p>

<p>I caused myself to be let down by a rope into the Master of
Balliol's garden, plucked up some of the finest flowers by the roots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and planted in their place great staring marigolds. The study of
the old gentleman's countenance when he saw them next morning
was a joy for ever. Another prank was to shoot with an air-cane,
an article strictly forbidden in college, at a brand-new watering-pot,
upon which the old gentleman greatly prided himself, and the way
which the water spirted over his reverend gaiters, gave an ineffable
delight to the knot of mischievous undergraduates who were prospecting
him from behind the curtain. I, however, always had considerable
respect for the sturdy common sense of old Dr. Jenkins,
and I made a kind of amends to him in "Vikram and the Vampire,"
where he is the only Pundit who objected to the tiger being
resurrectioned. Another neat use of the air-cane, was to shoot the
unhappy rooks, over the heads of the dons, as they played at bowls;
the grave and reverend signiors would take up the body, and gravely
debate what had caused the sudden death, when a warm stream of
blood, trickling into their shirts, explained it only too clearly. No
undergraduate in college could safely read his classics out loud after
ten o'clock p.m., or his "oak" was broken with dumb-bells, and the
dirty oil lamp, that half lit the stairs, was thrown over him and his
books.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Friends"></a>Friends.</i></div>

<p>I made amends to a certain extent for my mischief by putting my
fellow-collegians to bed, and I always maintain that the Welshmen
were those who gave me the most trouble.</p>

<p>The Oxford day, considered with relation to the acquisition of
knowledge, was a "fast" pure and simple&mdash;it began in the morning
with Chapel, during which time most men got up their logic. We
then breakfasted either in our rooms, or in large parties, where
we consumed an immense quantity of ham, bacon, eggs, mutton
chops, and indigestible muffins. We then attended a couple of
lectures, and this was Time completely thrown away. We were
then free for the day, and every man passed his time as he best
pleased. I could not afford to keep horses, and always hated the
idea of riding hired hacks. My only amusements therefore were
walking, rowing, and the school-at-arms. My walks somehow or
other always ended at Bagley Wood, where a pretty gypsy girl
(Selina), dressed in silks and satins, sat in state to receive the
shillings and the homage of the undergraduates. I worked hard,
under a coach, at sculling and rowing; I was one of the oars in the
College Torpid, and a friend and I challenged the River in a two-oar,
but unfortunately both of us were rusticated before the race
came off.</p>

<p>My friend in misfortune belonged to an eminent ecclesiastical
family, and distinguished himself accordingly. Returning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Australia, he landed at Mauritius without a farthing. Most
men under the circumstances would have gone to the Governor,
told their names, and obtained a passage to England. But the
individual in question had far too much individuality to take so
commonplace a step. He wrote home to his family for money, and
meanwhile took off his coat, tucked up his sleeves, and worked like
a coolie on the wharf. When the cheque for his passage was sent,
he invited all his brother coolies to a spread of turtle, champagne,
and all the luxuries of the season, at the swell hotel of the place,
and left amidst the blessings of Shem and the curse of Japhet.
Another of my college companions&mdash;the son of a bishop, by-the-by&mdash;made
a cavalry regiment too hot to hold him, and took his passage
to the Cape of Good Hope in an emigrant ship. On the third day
he brought out a portable roulette table, which the captain sternly
ordered off the deck. But the ship was a slow sailer, she fell in
with calms about the Line, and the official rigour was relaxed. First
one began to play, and then another, and at last the ship became a
perfect "hell." After a hundred narrow escapes, and all manner
of risks by fire and water, and the fists and clubs of the enraged
losers, the distinguished youth landed at Cape Town with almost
£5000 in his pocket.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Fencing-rooms"></a>Fencing-rooms.</i></div>

<p>The great solace of <i>my</i> life was the fencing-room. When I first
entered Oxford, its only <i>salle d'armes</i> was kept by old Angelo,
the grandson of the gallant old Italian, mentioned by Edgeworth,
but who knew about as much of fencing as a French collegian after
six months of <i>salle d'armes</i>. He was a priggish old party too, celebrated
for walking up to his pupils and for whispering stagely, after
a salute with the foil, "This, sir, is not so much a School of Arms as
a <i>School of Politeness</i>." Presently a rival appeared in the person of
Archibald Maclaren, who soon managed to make his mark. He
established an excellent saloon, and he gradually superseded all the
wretched gymnastic yard, which lay some half a mile out of the
town. He was determined to make his way; he went over to Paris,
when he could, to work with the best masters, published his systems
of fencing and gymnastics, and he actually wrote a little book of
poetry, which he called "Songs of the Sword." He and I became
great friends, which friendship lasted for life. The only question
that ever arose between us was touching the advisability or non-advisability
of eating sweet buns and drinking strong ale at the same
time. At the fencing-rooms I made acquaintance, which afterwards
became a life-long friendship, with Alfred Bates Richards. He was a
tall man, upwards of six feet high, broad in proportion, and very
muscular. I found it unadvisable to box with him, but could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
master him with foil and broadsword. He was one of the few who
would take the trouble to learn. Mostly Englishmen go to a fencing
school, and, after six weeks' lessons, clamour to be allowed to fence
loose, and very loose fencing it is, and is fated always to be. In
the same way, almost before they can fix their colours they want to
paint <i>tableaux de genre</i>, and they have hardly learnt their scales,
when they want to attempt <i>bravura</i> pieces. On the Continent men
work for months, and even years, before they think themselves in
sight of their journey's end. A. B. Richards and I often met in
after life and became intimates.<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His erratic career is well known,
and he died at a comparatively early age, editor of the <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>. He had raised the tone of the Licensed Victuallers'
organ to such a high pitch that even Lord Beaconsfield congratulated
him upon it.</p>

<p>A. B. Richards was furious to see the treatment my services
received; he always stood up bravely for me&mdash;his fellow-collegian,
both with word and pen&mdash;in leaders too.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Manners_and_Customs_Food_and_Smoking"></a>Manners and Customs&mdash;Food and Smoking.</i></div>

<p>The time for "Hall," that is to say for college dinner, was five
p.m., and the scene was calculated to astonish a youngster brought
up on the Continent. The only respectable part of it was the
place itself, not a bad imitation of some old convent refectory.
The details were mean in the extreme, and made me long for the
meanest <i>table d'hôte</i>. Along the bottom of the Hall, raised upon a
dwarf dais, ran the high table, intended for the use of fellows and
fellow-commoners. The other tables ran along the sides. Wine
was forbidden, malt liquor being the only drink. The food certainly
suited the heavy strong beers and ales brewed in the college. It
consisted chiefly of hunches of meat, cooked after Homeric or
Central African fashion, and very filling at the price. The vegetables,
as usual, were plain boiled, without the slightest aid to digestion.
Yet the college cooks were great swells. They were paid as
much as an average clergyman, and put most of their sons into the
Church. In fact, the stomach had to do the whole work, whereas a
good French or Italian cook does half the work for it in his saucepans.
This cannibal meal was succeeded by stodgy pudding, and
concluded with some form of cheese, Cheshire or double Gloucester,
which painfully reminded one of bees'-wax, and this was called
dinner. Very soon my foreign stomach began to revolt at such
treatment, and I found out a place in the town, where, when I could
escape Hall, I could make something of a dinner.</p>

<p>The moral of the scene offended all my prepossessions. The fellow-commoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
were simply men, who by paying double what the commoners
paid, secured double privileges. This distinction of castes
is odious, except in the case of a man of certain age, who would not
like to be placed in the society of young lads. But worse still was
the gold tuft, who walked the streets with a silk gown, and a
gorgeous tassel on his college cap. These were noblemen, the
offensive English equivalent for men of title. <i>Generosus nascitur
nobilis fit.</i> The Grandfathers of these noblemen may have been
pitmen or grocers, but the simple fact of <i>having</i> titles, entitled them
to most absurd distinctions. For instance, with a smattering of
letters, enough to enable a commoner to squeeze through an ordinary
examination, gold tuft took a first class, and it was even asserted
that many took their degrees by merely sending up their books.
They were allowed to live in London as much as they liked, and to
condescend to college at the rare times they pleased. Some Heads
of Colleges would not stoop to this degradation, especially Dean
Gaisford of Christ Church, who compelled Lord W&mdash;&mdash; to leave it
and betake himself to Trinity; but the place was, with notable
exceptions, a hotbed of toadyism and flunkeyism. When Mr. (now
Sir Robert) Peel first appeared in the High Street, man, woman, and
child stood to look at him because he was the son of the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>After dinner it was the custom to go to wine. These desserts
were another abomination. The table was spread with a vast variety
of fruits and sweetmeats, supplied at the very highest prices, and
often on tick, by the Oxford tradesmen,&mdash;model sharks. Some men
got their wine from London, others bought theirs in the town.
Claret was then hardly known, and port, sherry, and Madeira, all of
the strong military ditto type, were the only drinks. These wines
were given in turn by the undergraduates, and the meal upon meal
would have injured the digestion of a young shark. At last, about
this time, some unknown fellow, whose name deserved to be immortalized,
drew out a cigar and insisted on smoking it, despite the
disgust and uproar that the novelty created. But the fashion made
its way, and the effects were admirable. The cigar, and afterwards
the pipe, soon abolished the cloying dessert, and reduced the
consumption of the loaded wines to a minimum.</p>

<p>But the English were very peculiar about smoking. In the days
of Queen Anne it was so universal that dissident jurymen were locked
up without meat, drink, or tobacco. During the continental wars
it became un-English to smoke, and consequently men, and even
women, took snuff. And for years it was considered as disgraceful
to smoke a cigar out of doors as to have one's boots blacked, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
eat an orange at Hyde Park Corner. "Good gracious! you don't
mean to say that you smoke in the streets?" said an East Indian
Director in after years, when he met me in Pall Mall with a cigar in
my mouth. Admiral Henry Murray, too, vainly endeavoured to
break through the prohibition by leading a little squad of smoking
friends through Kensington Gardens. Polite ladies turned away
their faces, and unpolite ladies muttered something about "snobs."
At last the Duke of Argyll spread his plaid under a tree in Hyde
Park, lighted a cutty pipe, and beckoned his friends to join him.
Within a month every one in London had a cigar in his mouth. A
pretty lesson to inculcate respect for popular prejudice!</p>

<p>After the dessert was finished, not a few men called for cognac,
whisky, and gin, and made merry for the rest of the evening. But
what else was there for them to do? Unlike a foreign University,
the theatre was discouraged; it was the meanest possible little
house, decent actors were ashamed to show themselves in it, and
an actress of the calibre of Mrs. Nesbitt appeared only every few
years. Opera, of course, there was none, and if there had been,
not one in a thousand would have understood the language, and
not one in a hundred would have appreciated the music. Occasionally
there was a concert given by some wandering artists, with the
special permission of the college authorities, and a dreary two
hours' work it was. Balls were unknown, whereby the marriageable
demoiselles of Oxford lost many an uncommon good chance. A
mesmeric lecturer occasionally came down there and caused some
fun. He called for subjects, and amongst the half-dozen that
presented themselves was one young gentleman who had far more
sense of humour than discretion. When thrown into a deep slumber,
he arose, with his eyes apparently fast closed, and, passing into the
circle of astonished spectators, began to distribute kisses right and
left. Some of these salutations fell upon the sacred cheeks of the
daughters of the Heads of Houses, and the tableau may be imagined.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Drs_Newman_and_Pusey"></a>Drs. Newman and Pusey.</i></div>

<p>This dull, monotonous life was varied in my case by an occasional
dinner with families whose acquaintance I had made in the town.
At Dr. Greenhill's I once met at dinner Dr. (afterwards Cardinal)
Newman and Dr. Arnold. I expected great things from their
conversation, but it was mostly confined to discussing the size of
the Apostles in the Cathedral of St. Peter's in Rome, and both these
eminent men showed a very dim recollection of the subject. I took
a great fancy to Dr. Newman, and used to listen to his sermons,
when I would never give half an hour to any other preacher. There
was a peculiar gentleness in his manner, and the matter was always
suggestive. Dr. Newman was Vicar of St. Mary's, at Oxford, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
used to preach, at times, University sermons; there was a stamp
and seal upon him, a solemn music and sweetness in his tone and
manner, which made him singularly attractive, yet there was no
change of inflexion in his voice; action he had none; his sermons
were always read, and his eyes were ever upon his book; his figure
was lean and stooping, and the <i>tout ensemble</i> was anything but
dignified or commanding, yet the delivery suited the matter of his
speech, and the combination suggested complete candour and
honesty; he said only what he believed, and he induced others to
believe with him.<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> On the other hand, Dr. Pusey's University sermons
used to last for an hour and a half; they were filled with Latin
and Greek, dealt with abstruse subjects, and were delivered in the
dullest possible way, and seemed to me like a <i>mauvais rêve</i> or nightmare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Began_Arabic"></a>Began Arabic.</i></div>

<p>At Dr. Greenhill's, too, I met Don Pascual de Gayangos, the
Spanish Arabist. Already wearying of Greek and Latin, I had
attacked Arabic, and soon was well on in Erpinius's Grammar;
but there was no one to teach me, so I began to teach myself, and
to write the Arabic letters from left to right, instead of from right to
left, <i>i.e.</i> the wrong way. Gayangos, when witnessing this proceeding,
burst out laughing, and showed me how to copy the alphabet. In
those days, learning Arabic at Oxford was not easy. There was a
Regius Professor, but he had other occupations than to profess. If
an unhappy undergraduate went up to him, and wanted to learn, he
was assured that it was the duty of a professor to teach a class, and
not an individual. All this was presently changed, but not before
it was high time. The Sundays used generally to be passed in
"outings." It was a pleasure to get away from Oxford, and to
breathe the air which was not at least half smoke.</p>

<p>Another disagreeable of Oxford was, the continuous noise of bells.
You could not make sure of five minutes without one giving tongue,
and in no part of the world, perhaps, is there a place where there is
such a perpetual tinkling of metal. The maddening jangle of bells
seems to have been the survival of two centuries ago. In 1698 Paul
Heutzner wrote: "The English are vastly fond of great noises that
fill the air, such as the firing of cannon, drums, and the ringing of
bells, so that it is common for a number of them that have got a
'glass' in their heads, to go up into some belfry, and ring the bells
for hours together for the sake of exercise."</p>

<p>A favourite Sunday trip used to be to Abingdon, which, by the
wisdom of the dons in those days, was the railway station of Oxford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Like most men of conservative tendency, who disliked to move quiet
things, who cultivated the <i>status quo</i>, because they could hardly be
better off, and might be worse off, and who feared nothing more
than innovations, because these might force on enquiring into
the disposal of the revenues and other delicate monetary questions,
they had fought against the line with such good will, that they
had left it nearly ten miles distant from the town. Their conduct
was by no means exceptional; thousands did the same. For
instance, Lord John Scott, determined to prevent the surveyor
passing through his estate, engaged a company of "Nottingham
Lambs," and literally strewed the floor of the porter's lodge with broken
surveying instruments. Mrs. Partington cannot keep out the tide
with her rake, and the consequence was that Oxford was obliged to
build a branch line, and soon had to lament that she had lost the
advantage of the main line.</p>

<p>The Rev. Thomas Short was at that time doing Sunday duty at
Abingdon. He was not distinguished for ability as a college tutor,
but he was a gentlemanly and kind-hearted man; he was careful not
to be too sharp-eyed when he met undergraduates at Abingdon.
They generally drove out in tandems, which the absurd regulations
of the place kept in fashion, by forbidding them. No one would
have driven them had they not possessed the merits of stolen fruit.
I, having carefully practised upon "Dobbin" in my earlier days, used
thoroughly to enjoy driving. In later years I met with my old tutor,
the Rev. Thomas Short, who lived to a great age, and died universally
respected and regretted by all who knew him.<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>At last the lagging autumnal term passed away, and I went up to
my grandmother and aunts in Great Cumberland Place. It was not
lively; a household full of women only, rarely is.</p>

<p>The style of Society was very promiscuous. The Rev. Mr.
Hutchins, the clergyman under whom the family "sat" in the
adjoining Quebec Chapel, introduced me to the eccentric Duke
of Brunswick, who used to laugh consumedly at my sallies of high
spirits. Lady Dinorben, with whom Mrs. Phayre still lived, gave
me an occasional invitation. The aunts' near neighbours were
old General Sutherland of the Madras Army, whose son Alick I
afterwards met in the Neilgherry Hills. Mr. Lawyer Dendy was
still alive, and one of his sons shortly after followed me to India as a
Bombay civilian. Another pleasant acquaintance was Mrs. White,
wife of the colonel of the 3rd Dragoons, whose three stalwart sons
were preparing for India, and gave me the first idea of going there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
A man who dances, who dresses decently, and who is tolerably
well introduced, rarely wants invitations to balls in London, and I
found some occupation for my evenings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Play"></a>Play.</i></div>

<p>But I sadly wanted a club, and in those days the institution was
not as common as it is now. At odd times I went to the theatres,
and amused myself with the humours of the little "Pic" and the
old Cocoa-Nut Tree. But hazard is a terrible game. It takes a
man years to learn it well, and by that time he has lost all the
luck with which he begins. I always disliked private play, although
I played a tolerable hand at whist, <i>écarté</i>, and piquet, but I found
it almost as unpleasant to win from my friends as to lose to my
friends. On the other hand, I was unusually lucky at public
tables. I went upon a principle, not a theory, which has ruined
so many men. I noted as a rule that players are brave enough
when they lose, whereas they begin to fear when they win. My
plan, therefore, was to put a certain sum in my pocket and resolve
never to exceed it. If I lost it I stopped, one of the advantages of
public over private playing; but I did not lay down any limits to
winning when I was in luck; I boldly went ahead, and only stopped
when I found fortune turning the other way.</p>

<p>My grandmother's house was hardly pleasant to a devoted smoker;
I was put out on the leads, leading from the staircase, whenever I
required a weed. So I took lodgings in Maddox Street, and there
became as it were a "man about town." My brother Edward joined
me, and we had, as the Yankees say, "A high old time." It appeared
only too short, and presently came on the Spring Term, when I
returned to my frouzy rooms in Trinity College; and I had not
formed many friendships in Trinity itself. It had made a name for
fastness amongst the last generation of undergraduates, and now a
reaction had set in. They laughed at me, at my first lecture, because
I spoke in Roman Latin&mdash;real Latin&mdash;I did not know the English
pronunciation, only known in England. The only men of my own
college I met in after life, were Father Coleridge, S.J., and Edward
A. Freeman, of Somerleaze, the historian.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grundy had then just begun to reign, inaugurated by Douglas
Jerrold with "What will Mrs. Grundy say?" This ancient <i>genitrix</i>
highly disapproved of my foreign ways, and my expressed dislike to
school and college, over which I ought to have waxed sentimental,
tender, and æsthetic; it appeared to her little short of blasphemy.
I had a few friends at "Exeter," including Richards, and three at
Brasenose, then famous for drinking heavy beers and ales as Bonn
or Heidelberg, especially on Shrove Tuesday, when certain verses
chaffingly called the "Carmen seculare" used to be sung. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
delighted in "Oriel," which, both as regards fellows and undergraduates,
was certainly the nicest college of <i>my</i> day. There I spent
the chief part of my time with Wilberforce, Foster, and a little knot,
amongst whom was Tom Hughes (afterwards Tom Brown). We boxed
regularly, and took lessons from Goodman, ex-pugilist and pedestrian,
and actual tailor, who came down to Oxford at times. We had great
fun with Burke&mdash;the fighting man&mdash;who on one occasion honoured
Oxford with his presence. The "Deaf 'un," as he was called, had a
face that had been hammered into the consistency of sole-leather,
and one evening, after being too copiously treated, he sat down in a
heavy armchair, and cried out, "Now, lads! half a crown a hit."
We all tried our knuckles upon his countenance, and only hurt our
own knuckles.</p>

<p>Balliol (it was chiefly supplied from Rugby) then held her head
uncommonly high. As all know, Dr. Arnold had made the fortune
of Rugby, and caused it to be recognized among public schools.
During his early government the Rugbyites had sent a cricket
challenge to Eton, and the Etonians had replied "that they would
be most happy to send their scouts;" but as scholarship at Eton
seemed to decline, so it rose in Rugby and Oxford. Scholarship
means £ <i>s. d.</i> At Balliol I made acquaintance with a few men,
whose names afterwards made a noise in the world. They all
belonged to a generation, collegically speaking, older than myself.
Coleridge (now Lord Coleridge) was still lingering there, but he had
taken his bachelor's degree, and his brother, afterwards a Jesuit and
author of many works, was a scholar at Trinity. Ward of Balliol,
who also became a Catholic, was chiefly remarkable for his minute
knowledge of the circulating library novels of the Laura-Matilda type.
He suffered from insomnia, and before he could sleep, he was obliged
to get through a few volumes every night. Lake of Balliol, then a
young don, afterwards turned out a complete man of the world; and
there is no need to speak of Jowett, who had then just passed as
B.A., and was destined to be Master of Balliol.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Coaching_and_Languages"></a>Coaching and Languages.</i></div>

<p>Oxford between 1840 and 1842 was entering upon great changes.
The old style of "fellow," a kind of survival of the Benedictine
monks, was rapidly becoming extinct, and only one or two remained.
Men who lived surrounded by their books on vertical stands, were
capable of asking you if "cats let loose in woods would turn to
tigers," and tried to keep pace with the age by reading up the
<i>Times</i> of eight years past. But a great deal of reform was still
wanted. Popular idea about Oxford was, that the Classic groves
of Isis were hotbeds for classical <i>Scholasticism</i>, whilst Cambridge
succeeded better in Mathematics, but I soon found out that one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
learn more Greek and Latin in one year at Bonn and Heidelberg
than in three at Oxford. The college teaching, for which one was
obliged to pay, was of the most worthless description. Two hours
a day were regularly wasted, and those who read for honours were
obliged to choose and to pay for a private coach. Amongst the said
coaches were some <i>drôles</i>, who taught in very peculiar ways, by
Rhymes, not always of the most delicate description. One celebrated
coach, after lecturing his blockheads upon the subject, we
will say, of Salmanizer, would say to them, "Now, you fellows, you'll
forget in a day everything that I've been teaching you for the last
hour. Whenever you hear this man's name, just repeat to yourselves
&mdash;&mdash; and you'll remember all about it."</p>

<p>The worst of such teaching was, that it had no order and no
system. Its philology was ridiculous, and it did nothing to work the
reasoning powers. Learning foreign languages, as a child learns
its own, is mostly a work of pure memory, which acquires, after
childhood, every artificial assistance possible. My system of learning
a language in two months was purely my own invention, and
thoroughly suited myself. I got a simple grammar and vocabulary,
marked out the forms and words which I knew were absolutely
necessary, and learnt them by heart by carrying them in my pocket
and looking over them at spare moments during the day. I never
worked more than a quarter of an hour at a time, for after that the
brain lost its freshness. After learning some three hundred words,
easily done in a week, I stumbled through some easy book-work
(one of the Gospels is the most come-atable), and underlined every
word that I wished to recollect, in order to read over my pencillings
at least once a day. Having finished my volume, I then carefully
worked up the grammar minutiæ, and I then chose some other book
whose subject most interested me. The neck of the language was
now broken, and progress was rapid. If I came across a new
sound like the Arabic <i>Ghayn</i>, I trained my tongue to it by repeating
it so many thousand times a day. When I read, I invariably read
out loud, so that the ear might aid memory. I was delighted with
the most difficult characters, Chinese and Cuneiform, because I felt
that they impressed themselves more strongly upon the eye than the
eternal Roman letters. This, by-and-by, made me resolutely stand
aloof from the hundred schemes for transliterating Eastern languages,
such as Arabic, Sanscrit, Hebrew, and Syriac, into Latin letters, and
whenever I conversed with anybody in a language that I was learning,
I took the trouble to repeat their words inaudibly after them, and so
to learn the trick of pronunciation and emphasis.</p>

<p>The changes which followed 1840 made an important difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in the value of fellowships. They were harder to get and harder to
keep. They were no longer what the parlous and supercilious youth
defined them, "An admirable provision for the indigent members
of the middle classes." The old half-monk disappeared, or rather
he grew his moustachios, and passed his vacations "sur le Continong."
But something still remains to be done. It is a scandal to
meet abroad in diplomacy, and other professions, a gentleman belonging
to the <i>bene nati, bene vestiti, modice docti</i> of "All Souls',"
drawing, moreover, his pay for doing nothing. The richest University
in the world is too poor to afford the host of professors still
required, and it is a disgrace that an English University, whose
name means the acquisition of universal knowledge, should not be
able to teach Cornish, Gaelic, Welsh, and Irish, the original languages
of the island. Again, the endowment of research, a <i>sine
quâ non</i>, is simply delayed because money is not forthcoming. A
little sensible economy would remedy this, and make Oxford what
she ought to be, a Seat of Learning&mdash;not, as the old fellows of
Christ Church define it, "A place to make rather ignorant gentlemen."
The competition fellowships at Oxford were started in 1854,
which changed the whole condition of things.</p>

<p>During this term I formally gave up my intention to read for a
first class. <i>Aut primus aut nullus</i> was ever my motto, and though
many second-class men have turned out better than many first-class
men, I did not care to begin life with a failure. I soon ascertained
the fact that men who may rely upon first classes are bred to it from
their childhood, even as horses and dogs are trained. They must
not waste time and memory upon foreign tongues. They must not
dissipate their powers of brain upon anything like general education.
They may know the -isms, but they must be utterly ignorant of the -ologies;
but, above all things, they must not indulge themselves with
what is popularly called "<i>The World</i>." They must confine themselves
to one straight line, a college curriculum, and even then they
can never be certain of success. At the very moment of gaining the
prize their health may break down, and compel them to give up
work. I surprised Dr. Greenhill by my powers of memory when I
learned Adam's "Antiquities" by heart. But the doctor, who had
not taken a class himself, threw cold water on my ambition&mdash;perhaps
the best thing he could do&mdash;and frankly told me that, though I <i>could</i>
take a first class, he could by no means answer that I <i>would</i>. The
fellows of Trinity were nice gentlemanly men, but I by no means
wished to become one of the number. My father had set his heart
upon both sons being provided for by the Universities, and very
often "when fathers propose, sons dispose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>My disgust at the idea of University honours was perhaps not
decreased by my trying for the two scholarships, and failing to
get them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Latin_Greek"></a>Latin&mdash;Greek.</i></div>

<p>I attributed my non-success at University College (where I was
beaten by a man who turned a chorus of Æschylus into doggerel
verse) chiefly to my having stirred the bile of my examiners with my
real (Roman) Latin. At times, too, the devil palpably entered into
me, and made me speak Greek Romaically by accent, and not by
quantity, even as they did and still do at Athens. I had learnt this
much from one of the Rhodo-Kanakis Greek merchants at Marseille,
so that I could converse in Latin and Greek as spoken as well as
ancient Latin and Greek.</p>

<p>The history of the English pronunciation of Latin is curious.
In Chaucer it was after the Roman fashion, in Spencer the English
A appears, and the change begins to make itself felt under the
succession of Queen Elizabeth. It is most probable that this was
encouraged by the leaders of education, in order more thoroughly
to break with Rome. The effect was, that after learning Greek and
Latin for twenty years, a lad could hardly speak a sentence, because
he had never been taught to converse in the absurdly <i>called</i> Dead
Languages, and if he did speak, not a soul but an Englishman
could understand him. The English pronunciation of Latin vowels,
happens to be the very worst in the world, because we have an
O and an A which belongs peculiarly to English, and which destroys
all the charms of those grand-sounding vowels.</p>

<p>Years after I was laughed at at Oxford, public opinion took a
turn, and Roman pronunciation of Latin was adopted in many
of the best schools. I was anxious to see them drop their absurd
mispronunciation of Greek, but all the authorities whom I consulted
on the subject, declared to me that schoolmasters had quite enough
to do with learning Italianized Latin, and could not be expected to
trouble themselves with learning Athenianized Greek. I had another
most quixotic idea, which was truly breaking one's head against a
windmill. I wanted the public to pronounce Yob for Job, Yericho
for Jericho, Yakoob for Jacob, and Yerusalem for Jerusalem. The
writers of the Anglican version, must certainly have intended this,
and it is inconceivable how the whole English public dropped the
cognate German pronunciation of J, and took to that of France and
Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Holidays"></a>Holidays.</i></div>

<p>At last the dreary time passed away, and a happy family meeting
was promised. My father brought my mother and sister from Pisa
to Wiesbaden in Germany, and we boys, as we were still called, were
invited over to spend the Long Vacation. We were also to escort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Mrs. D'Aguilar, who with two of her daughters were determined to
see the Rhine. One of the girls was Emily, who died soon. The
other was Eliza, who married a clergyman of the name of Pope, and
whose son, Lieutenant Pope of the 24th Queen's, died gallantly at
Isandula; though surrounded by numbers, he kept firing his revolver
and wounding his enemies, till he received a mortal wound by an
assegai in the breast. This was on January 22nd, 1879. In the end
of 1875 he came to Folkestone, to take leave of my wife and me,
who were going out to India. We both liked him very much.</p>

<p>In those days travellers took the steamer from London Bridge,
dropped quietly down the Thames, and, gaining varied information
about the places on both sides of it, dined as usual on a boiled leg
of mutton and caper sauce, and roast ribs of beef with horse-radish,
and slept as best they could in the close boxes called berths or
on deck; if the steamer was in decent order, and there was not too
much head wind, they could be in the Scheldt next morning.</p>

<p>Our little party passed a day at Antwerp, which looked beautiful
from the river. The Cathedral tower and the tall roofs and tapering
spires of the churches around it made a matchless group. We visited
the fortifications, which have lately done such good work, and we
had an indigestion of Rubens, who appeared so gross and so fleshy
after the Italian school. Mrs. D'Aguilar was dreadfully scandalized,
when, coming suddenly into a room, she found her two nephews at
romps with a pretty little <i>soubrette</i>, whose short petticoats enabled
her to deliver the sharpest possible kicks, while she employed her
hands in vigorously defending her jolly red cheeks. The poor lady
threw up her hands and her eyes to heaven when she came suddenly
upon this little scene, and she was even more shocked when she
found that her escort had passed the Sunday evening in the theatre.</p>

<p>From Antwerp we travelled to Bruges, examined the belfry, heard
the chimes, and then went on to Cologne. A marvellous old
picturesque place it was, with its combination of old churches,
crumbling walls, gabled houses, and the narrowest and worst-paved
streets we had ever seen. The old Cathedral in those days was
not finished, and threatened never to be finished. Still there was
the grand solitary tower, with the mystical-looking old crane on the
top, and a regular garden growing out of the chinks and crannies of
the stonework. Coleridge's saying about Cologne, was still emphatically
true in those days, and all travellers had recourse to
"Jean Marie Farina <i>Gegenüber</i>." What a change there is now, with
that hideous Gothic railway bridge, and its sham battlements, and
loopholes to defend nothing, with its hideous cast-iron turret over
the centre of the church, where the old architect had intended a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
light stone lantern-tower, with the ridiculous terrace surrounding
the building, and with the hideous finials with which the modern
German architects have disfigured the grand old building!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Rhine_to_Wiesbaden"></a>The Rhine to Wiesbaden.</i></div>

<p>At Cologne we took the steamer and ran up the river. A far
more sensible proceeding than that of these days, when tourists take
the railway, and consequently can see only one side of the view.
The river craft was comfortable, the meals were plentiful, the
Piesporter was a sound and unadulterated wine, and married remarkably
well with Knaster tobacco, smoked in long pipes with painted
china bowls. The crowd, too, was good-tempered, and seemed to
enjoy its holiday. Bonn, somehow or other, always managed to
show at least one very pretty girl, with blue porcelain eyes and
gingerbread-coloured hair. Then came the Castle Crag of Drachenfels
and the charming Siebengebirge, which in those days were not
spoiled by factory chimneys. We landed at Mainz, and from
there drove over to the old Fontes Mattiace, called in modern day
Wiesbaden.</p>

<p>It has been said that to enjoy the Rhine one must go to it <i>from</i>
England, not the other way from Switzerland; and travellers'
opinions are very much divided about it, some considering it extremely
grand, and others simply pretty. I was curious to see what
its effect upon me would be after visiting the four quarters of the
globe; so, in May, 1872, I dropped down the river from Basle to the
mouth. The southern and the northern two-thirds were uninteresting,
but I found the middle as pretty as ever, and, in fact, I
enjoyed the beautiful and interesting river more than when I had
seen it as a boy.</p>

<p>I found the middle, beginning at Bingen, charming. Bishop
Hatto's Tower had become a cockneyfied affair, and the castles,
banks, and islands were disagreeably suggestive of Richmond Hill.
But Drachenfels, Nonnenswerth, and Rolandseck, were charming,
and I quite felt the truth of the saying, that this is one of the
paradises of Germany. At Düsseldorf the river became old and
ugly, and so continued till Rotterdam.</p>

<p>Wiesbaden in those days was intensely "German and ordinary,"
as Horace Walpole says. It was a kind of Teutonic Margate, with
a <i>chic</i> of its own. In the days before railways, this was the case with
all these "Baths," where people either went to play, or to get rid of
what the Germans call <i>eine sehr schöne corpulenz</i>, a corporation
acquired by stuffing food of three kinds, salt, sour, or greasy, during
nine or ten months of the year. It was impossible to mistake
princely Baden-Baden and its glorious Black Forest, for invalid
Kissingen or for Homberg, which combined mineral waters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
gambling tables. Wiesbaden was so far interesting that it showed
the pure and unadulterated summer life of middle-class Germans.
There you see in perfection the grave blue-green German eye.</p>

<p>You are surprised at the frequency of the name of Johann. Johann
was a servant; Johannes, a professor; Schani, a swell; Jean, a kind
of <i>fréluqué</i>; Hans, a peasant; and Hansl, a village idiot. Albrecht,
with flat occiput, and bat-like ears, long straight hair and cap, with
unclean hands, and a huge signet ring on his forefinger, with a pipe
rivalling the size of a Turkish <i>chibouque</i>, took his regular seat on
one of the wooden benches of the promenade, with Frau Mutter
mending his stockings on one side, and Fraülein Gretchen knitting
mittens on the other. This kind of thing would continue perhaps
for ten seasons, but on the eleventh you met Albrecht, <i>au petit soins</i>,
with Mütze as his bride, and Gretchen being waited upon by her
bridegroom Fritz, and then everything went on as before. Amongst
the women the <i>kaffee-gesellschaft</i> flourished, when coffee and scandal
took the place of scandal and tea, the beverage which I irreverently
call "chatter-water." The lady of the house invites two or three friends
to come and bring their work and drink a cup of coffee. Before the
hour arrives the invitations most likely number twenty. They dress
in afternoon promenade toilette, which was very unadorned at
Wiesbaden, and they drop in one by one&mdash;much kissing and shaking
of hands and uncloaking; then each one pulls out knitting, or various
pieces of work, which are mutually admired, and patterns borrowed,
and then they fall to upon children, servants, toilettes, domestic
economy, and the reputations of such of their friends as are not
there. This goes on for hours, only interrupted by the servant
wheeling in a table covered with coffee, cakes, sweetmeats, jam, and
<i>kugelhupf</i>.</p>

<p>In the evening there was often a dance at the Kursaal&mdash;admirable
waltzing, and sometimes quadrilles with steps. Here the bald old
Englishman, who in France would collect around him all the old
ladies in the room to see him dance, was little noticed. The hearty
and homely Germans danced themselves, even when they had grey
hair.</p>

<p>Our family found a comfortable house at Wiesbaden, and the
German servants received the "boys," as we were still called, with
exclamations of "Ach! die schöne schwarze kinder." We paid
occasionally furtive visits to the Kursaal, and lost a few sovereigns
like men. But our chief amusement was the fencing-room. Here
we had found new style of play, with the <i>schläger</i>, a pointless rapier
with razor-like edges. It was a favourite student's weapon, used to
settle all their affairs of honour, and they used it with the silly hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
guard. Some of them gave half an hour every day to working at
the post, a wooden pillar stuck up in the middle of the room and
bound with vertical ribbons of iron.</p>

<p>When we were tired of Wiesbaden, we amused ourselves with
wandering about the country. We visited the nearer watering-places.
The first was Schwalbach, "the Swallows' Brook," where the rusty
waters turned all our hair red. We then went off to Schlangenbad,
"the Snakes' Bath," whose Kalydor made the Frenchman fall in love
with himself. These waters had such a reputation, that one lady (of
course she was called a Russian Princess) used to have them sent
half across Europe for daily use.</p>

<p>In those days there were not many English in these out-of-the-way
places, and the greater number were Oxford and Cambridge men.
They were learning German and making the most extraordinary
mistakes. One gentleman said that the German particles were
difficult, but he made a great confusion of the matter. Amongst
others, there were the daughters of Archbishop Whately, at that time
very nice girls. We then returned to Wiesbaden, and went over to
Heidelberg, which is so charmingly picturesque. Here we found a
little colony of English, and all fraternized at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Nassau_Brigade"></a>The Nassau Brigade.</i></div>

<p>We "boys" wanted to enter one of the so-called brigades, and
chose the Nassau, which was the fightingest of all. An Irish student,
who was one of the champions of the corps, and who had distinguished
himself by slitting more than one nose, called upon us, and, over
sundry <i>schoppes</i> of beer, declared that we could not be admitted without
putting in an appearance at the Hirschgasse. This was a little
pot-house at the other side of the river, with a large room where
monomachies were fought. The appearance of the combatants was
very ridiculous. They had thick felt caps over their heads, whose
visors defended their eyes. Their necks were swathed in enormous
cravats, and their arms were both padded, and so were their bodies
from the waist downwards. There was nothing to hit but the face
and the chest. That, however, did not prevent disagreeable
accidents. Sometimes too heavy a cut went into the lungs, and at
other times took an effect upon either eye. But the grand thing was to
walk off with the tip of the adversary's nose, by a dexterous upward
snick from the hanging guard. A terrible story was told of a duel
between a handsome man and an ugly man. Beauty had a lovely
nose, and Beast so managed that presently it was found on the
ground. Beauty made a rush for it, but Beast stamped it out of all
shape. There was a very little retreating in these affairs, for the
lines were chalked upon the ground. The seconds stood by, also
armed with swords and protected with masks, to see that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
nothing like a <i>sauhieb</i> or unfair cut. A medical student was always
present, and when a cut went home, the affair was stopped to sew it
up. Sometimes, however, the artery shrank, and its patient was
marked with a cross, as it was necessary to open his cheek above and
below in order to tie it up.</p>

<p>A story is told of a doctor who attended a students' duel, when the
mask fell, and one of them lost his nose. The doctor flew at it and
picked it up, and put it in his mouth to keep it warm, whipped out
his instruments, needle and thread, and so skilfully stitched on the
nose, and stopped it with plaster, that the edges united, and in a few
weeks the nose was as handsome and useful as ever.</p>

<p>We boys did not see the fun of this kind of thing, and when our
Irish friend told us what the ordeal was, we said that we were perfectly
ready to turn out with foils or rapiers, but that we could not stand
the paddings. Duels with the broadsword, and without protection,
were never fought except on desperate occasions. Our friend
promised to report it to the brigade, and the result was that some
time afterwards we were introduced to a student, who said that he
knew a little fencing, and should like to try a <i>botte</i> with us. We
smelt a rat, as the phrase is, and showed him only half of what we
could do. But apparently that was enough, for our conditions were
not accepted, and we were not admitted into the Nassau Brigade.</p>

<p>At Heidelberg I told my father that Oxford life did not in any
way suit me. I pleaded for permission to go into the Army, and, that
failing, to emigrate to Canada or Australia. He was inexorable. He
was always thinking of that fellowship. Edward, too, was deadly
tired of Dr. Havergal, and swore that he would rather be a "private"
than a fellow of Cambridge. However, he was sent <i>nolens volens</i>
to the University on the Cam, and there he very speedily came to
grief. It was remarked of him, before the end of the first term, that
he was never seen at Chapel. His tutor sent for him, and permitted
himself strong language on this delinquency. "My dear sir," was
the reply, "no party of pleasure ever gets me out of bed before ten
o'clock, and do you <i>really, really</i> think that I am going to be in
Chapel at eight o'clock?" "Are you joking, or is that your mature
decision?" said the tutor. "My very ripest decision," said Edward,
and consequently he was obliged to leave college without delay.</p>

<p>When the visit was over, and the autumnal term was beginning, I
left Germany and steamed down the Rhine. Everything that I saw
made me less likely to be pleased at the end of my journey. However,
there was no choice for it. I arrived in London, and found my
grandmother and aunts still at the seaside, in a house over the cliff
at Ramsgate. Ramsgate I rather liked. There were some very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
handsome girls there, the Ladies P&mdash;&mdash;t, and the place had a kind of
distant resemblance to Boulogne. The raffles at the libraries made
it a caricature of a German Bath. I wandered about the country;
I visited Margate, where the tone of society was perfectly marvellous,
and ran about the small adjacent bathing-places, like Broadstairs
and Herne Bay. This brought on the time when I was obliged to
return to Oxford.</p>

<p>I went there with no good will, and as my father had refused to
withdraw me from the University, I resolved to withdraw myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Straws_that_broke_the_Camels_Back"></a>The Straws that broke the Camel's Back.</i></div>

<p>My course of action was one of boyish thoughtlessness. Reports
of wine-parties were spread everywhere, whispers concerning parodies
on venerable subjects, squibs appeared in the local papers&mdash;in those
days an unpardonable offence&mdash;caricatures of Heads of Houses were
handed about, and certain improvisations were passed from mouth
to mouth. I had a curious power of improvising any number of
rhymes, without the slightest forethought; but the power, such as
it was, was perfectly useless to me, as it was accompanied with
occasional moments of nervousness, when I despaired, without the
slightest reason whatever, of finding the easiest rhyme. Probably
the professional Italian, who declaims a poem or a tragedy, labours
under the perfect conviction that nothing in the world can stop him.
And then it is so much easier to rhyme in Italian than in English;
so my efforts were mostly confined to epigrams and epitaphs, at
wines and supper-parties, and you may be sure that these brilliant
efforts did me no good.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end. My object was to be rusticated,
not to be expelled. The former may happen in consequence
of the smallest irregularity, the latter implies ungentlemanly conduct.
I cast about in all directions for the safest line, when fortune put
the clue into my hands. A celebrated steeplechaser, Oliver the
Irishman, came down to Oxford, and I was determined to see him
ride. The collegiate authorities, with questionable wisdom, forbad
us all to be present at the races, and especially at what they called
"the disgraceful scenes of 'race ordinaries.'" Moreover, in order
to make matters sure, they ordered all the undergraduates to be
present at the college lecture, at the hour when the race was to
be run.</p>

<p>A number of high-spirited youngsters of the different colleges
swore that they would not stand this nonsense, that it was infringing
the liberty of the subject, and that it was treating them like little
boys, which they did not deserve. Here, doubtless, they were right.
But, well foreseeing what would be the result, they acted according
to the common saying, "In for a penny, in for a pound;" so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the tandem was ordered to wait behind Worcester College, and
when they should have been attending a musty lecture in the tutor's
room, they were flicking across the country at the rate of twelve
miles an hour. The steeplechase was a delight, and Oliver was very
amusing at the race ordinary, although he did not express much
admiration for the riding of what he called "The Oxford lads."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Rusticated"></a>Rusticated.</i></div>

<p>Next morning there was eating of humble-pie. The various
culprits were summoned to the Green Room and made conscious of
the enormity of the offence. I secured the respect of the little knot
by arguing the point with the college dignitaries. I boldly asserted
that there was no moral turpitude at being present at a race. I
vindicated the honour and dignity of collegiate men by asserting
that they should not be treated as children. I even dropped the
general axiom "that trust begets trust," and "they who trust us
elevate us." Now, this was too much of a good thing, to commit
a crime, and to declare it a virtuous action. Consequently, when
all were rusticated, I was singled out from the <i>Hoi polloi</i>, by an
especial recommendation not to return to Oxford from a Rus. Stung
by a sense of injustice, I declared at once that I would leave the
college, and expressed a vicious hope, that the caution-money
deposited by my father would be honestly returned to him. This
was the climax. There was a general rise of dignitaries, as if a
violent expulsion from the room was intended. I made them my
lowest and most courtly bow, Austrian fashion, which bends the
body nearly double, wished them all happiness for the future, and
retired from the scene. I did not see Oxford again till 1850, when,
like the prodigal son, I returned to Alma Mater with a half-resolution
to finish my terms and take my bachelor degree.<a name="FNanchor_4_15" id="FNanchor_4_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_15" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But the
idea came too late. I had given myself up to Oriental studies, and
I had begun to write books. Yet I was always glad, during my
occasional visits home, to call at my old college, have a chat with
the Reverend and Venerable Thomas Short, and to breakfast and
dine with the dons who had been bachelors or undergraduates at
the time of my departure.</p>

<p>The way in which I left Oxford was characteristic of the rest.
One of my rusticated friends, Anderson of Oriel, had proposed that
we should leave with a splurge&mdash;"go up from the land with a soar."
There was now no need for the furtive tandem behind Worcester
College. It was driven boldly up to the college doors. My bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and baggage were stowed away in it, and with a cantering leader and
a high-trotting shaft-horse, which unfortunately went over the beds
of the best flowers, we started from the High Street by the Queen's
Highway to London, I artistically performing upon a yard of tin
trumpet, waving adieu to my friends, and kissing my hand to the
pretty shop-girls. In my anger I thoroughly felt the truth of the
sentiment&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I leave thee, Oxford, and I loathe thee well,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy saint, thy sinner, scholar, prig, and swell."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Alfred Bates Richards, Dick's college mate, wrote in after years:
"It is a curious reflection at school for any boy or any master,
'What will become of the boy? Who will turn out well? who ill?
Who will distinguish himself? who will remain in obscurity?
Who live? who die?' I am sure, though Burton was brilliant,
rather wild, and very popular, none of us foresaw his future greatness,
nor knew what a treasure we had amongst us."</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h3>

<h4>GOING TO INDIA.</h4>


<p>Arriving in London, I was received by the family harem with
some little astonishment, for they already knew enough of "terms"
to be aware that the last was unfinished. I was quite determined to
have two or three days in peace, so I thoroughly satisfied all the
exigencies of the position by declaring that I had been allowed an
extra vacation for taking a double-first with the very highest honours.
A grand dinner-party was given, quite the reverse of the fatted calf.
Unfortunately, amongst the guests was the Rev. Mr. Phillips, a
great friend of mine, who grinned at me, and indirectly ejaculated,
"Rusticated, eh?" The aunts said nothing at the time, but they
made inquiries, the result of which was a tableau.</p>

<p>This Phillips was the brother of Major-General Sir B. T. Phillips,
who served long and well in the Bengal army, was rather a noted
figure as a young-old man in London, and died in Paris in 1880.</p>

<p>You will say that these are wild oats with a vengeance, but most
thus sow them, and it is better that they should sow them in early
youth. Nothing is more melancholy than to see a man suddenly
emancipated from family rule, and playing tricks when the heyday
is passed. Youth is like new wine that must be allowed to ferment
freely, or it will never become clear, strong, and well flavoured.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_gets_a_Commission_and_begins_Hindostani"></a>He gets a Commission and begins Hindostani.</i></div>

<p>I was asked what I intended to do, and I replied simply that I
wished to go into the Army, but that I preferred the Indian service,
as it would show me more of the world, and give me a better chance
of active service. There was no great difficulty in getting a commission.
The Directors were bound not to sell them, but every now
and then they would give a nomination to a friend, and my friend
did not throw away the chance. My conviction is that the
commission cost £500.</p>

<p>It was arranged that I should sail in the spring, and meanwhile I
determined to have a jolly time. I made a number of new acquaintances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
including old Mr. Varley, the artist, of whom I was very fond.
He had just finished a curious book that he called "Zodiacal
Physiognomy," in order to prove that every man resembled, after a
fashion, the sign under which he was born. Readers will kindly
remember, that in the old Zodiacs, all the figures were either human
or bestial. Mr. Varley was a great student of occult science, and
perhaps his favourite was astrology. It is curious how little London
knows of what goes on in the next-door house. A book on
"Alchemy" was printed, and the curious fact came out, that at least
one hundred people in London were studying the philosopher's stone.</p>

<p>Mr. Varley drew out my horoscope, and prognosticated that I was
to become a great astrologer; but the prophesy came to nothing,
for, although I had read Cornelius Agrippa and others of the same
school at Oxford, I found Zadkiel quite sufficient for me. Amongst
the people that I met was the Rev. Robert, popularly called Satan
Montgomery, who had come up from Scotland deadly tired of
Glasgow punch, and was making a preaching campaign. He had
written a quantity of half-nonsense verses, which were very much
admired by his feminine devotees, and which were most savagely
mangled by Lord Macaulay in the <i>Quarterly</i>. He was an effective
figure in the pulpit; he had a very pale face, and tolerably straight
features, very black hair, and very white hands, with a large diamond
and a very white pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>He had, to a marvellous extent, what is vulgarly called the "gift
of the gab;" he spoke for an hour without a moment's hesitation.
But there was something solid below all this froth, and he had
carefully read up all the good old theological works. The women,
including the aunts, went literally mad; they crowded the little
Gothic chapel, they mobbed as he came in and went out, and they
literally overwhelmed him with slippers, chest-protectors, and portable
articles to administer the Sacrament. His reign was short; he married,
came up to London, took a chapel, subsided into the average
popular preacher, and soon died. Amongst others that I met was
a certain Robert Bagshaw from Calcutta, who was destined afterwards
to marry my aunt Georgina Baker. I managed to offend him
very much. He was rather boasting of a new dress-coat, when I
delicately raised the tail, and said, "You don't mean to say that you
call <i>this</i> a coat?"</p>

<p>With all this wasting of time, I kept my eye steadily fixed upon
the main chance. I gave up boxing at Owen Swift's, and fencing at
Angelo's, and spent all my spare time in learning Hindostani with
old Duncan Forbes. A very curious old Scotchman it was. He
had spent a year or so in Bombay, and upon the strength of it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
was perfect master of Oriental languages. He had two passions: one
was for smoking a huge meerschaum, stuffed with the strongest
possible tobacco, and the other was for chess, concerning which he
published some, at that time, very interesting and novel studies.</p>

<p>Perhaps his third passion was not quite so harmless; it was simply
for not washing. He spoke all his Eastern languages with the
broadest possible Scotch accent; and he cared much more for telling
anecdotes, than for teaching. However, he laid a fair foundation,
and my <i>then</i> slight studies of Arabic, secured me the old man's
regard. He published a number of books, and he certainly had not
the <i>suaviter in modo</i>. He attacked Eastwick, the Orientalist, in the
most ferocious style.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_goes_to_be_sworn_in_at_the_India_Office"></a>He goes to be sworn in at the India Office.</i></div>

<p>Presently the day came when I was to be sworn in at the India
House. In those days the old building stood in Leadenhall Street,
and gave Thackeray a good opportunity of attacking it as the "Hall
of Lead;" a wonderful dull and smoky old place, it was, with its
large and gorgeous porter outside, and its gloomy, stuffy old rooms
inside, an atmosphere which had actually produced "The Essays of
Elia." In those days it kept up a certain amount of respect for
itself. If an officer received a gift of a sword, he was conducted by
the tall porter to the general meeting of the Directors, and duly
spoken to and complimented in form; but as times waxed harder,
the poor twenty-four Kings of Leadenhall Street declined from Princes
into mere <i>Shayhks</i>. They actually sent a Sword of Honour to one of
their officers by a street messenger, and the donee returned it, saying,
he could, not understand the <i>manner</i> of the gift; and so it went on
gradually declining and falling, till at last the old house was abandoned
and let for offices. The shadowy Directors flitted to the West
End, into a brand-new India House, which soon brought on their
Euthanasia.</p>

<p>My bringing-up caused me to be much scandalized by the sight of
my future comrades and brother officers, which I will presently
explain. The Afghan disaster was still fresh in public memory.
The aunts had been patriotic enough to burst into tears when they
heard of it; and certainly it was an affecting picture, the idea of
a single Englishman, Dr. Brydone, riding into Jellalabad, the only
one of thirteen thousand, he and his horse so broken as almost to
die at the gates.</p>

<p>Poor General Elphinstone, by-the-by, had been my father's best
man at his marriage, and was as little fitted for such field service,
as Job was at his worst. Alexander Burns was the only headpiece
in the lot. He had had the moral courage to report how critical the
position was; but he had not the moral courage to insist upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
his advice being taken, and, that failing, to return to his regiment as
a Captain.</p>

<p>MacNaghten was a mere Indian civilian. Like too many of
them, he had fallen into the dodging ways of the natives, and he
distinctly deserved his death. The words used by Akbar Khan,
by-the-by, when he shot him, were, "Shumá mulk-e-má mí gírid"
("So you're the fellow who've come to take our country").</p>

<p>But the result of the massacre was a demand for soldiers and
officers, especially Anglo-Indians. Some forty medical students were
sent out, and they naturally got the name of the "Forty Thieves."
The excess of demand explained the curious appearance of the
embryo cadets when they met to be sworn in at the India House.
They looked like raw country lads, mostly dressed in home-made
clothes, and hair cut by the village barber, country boots, and no
gloves. So, my friend, Colonel White's son, who was entering the
service on the same day, and I looked at one another in blank
dismay. We had fallen amongst young Yahoos, and we looked
forward with terror to such society. I was originally intended for
Bengal, but, as has been seen, I had relations there. I was not
going to subject myself to surveillance by my uncle by marriage, an
old general of invalids. Moreover, one of my D'Aguilar cousins was
married to a judge in Calcutta. I was determined to have as much
liberty as possible, and therefore I chose Bombay. I was always of
opinion that a man proves his valour by doing what he likes; there
is no merit in so doing when you have a fair fortune and independent
position, but for a man bound by professional ties, and too often
lacking means to carry out his wishes, it is a great success to
choose his own line and stick to it.</p>

<p>The next thing to do was to obtain an outfit. This was another
great abuse in those days. As the friends of the Directors made
money by the cadets' commissions to the friends, the friends made
money by sending them to particular houses. The unfortunate
cadets, or rather their parents, were in fact plundered by everything
that touched them. The outfit, which was considered <i>de
rigueur</i>, was absurdly profuse. Dozens upon dozens of white
jackets and trousers, only fit to give rheumatism&mdash;even tobacco,
niggerhead, and pigtail, as presents for the sailors. Even the
publishers so arranged that their dictionaries and grammars of
Hindostani should be forced upon the unhappy youths.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The result
was absolutely ridiculous. As a rule, the bullock trunks were opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
during the voyage, the kit was displayed, and on fast ships it was
put down as a stake at cards. Stories are told of sharp hands
landing in India after winning half a dozen outfits, which literally
glutted the market. Guns, pistols, and swords, and saddles were of
the most expensive and useless description, and were all to be bought
much better, at a quarter the price, in any Indian port.</p>

<p>The average of the voyage lasted four months. Two or three
changes of suits only, were necessary, and the £100 outfit was
simply plunder to the outfitter.</p>

<p>An unusual article of outfit was ordered by me, and that was a
wig from Winter in Oxford Street. In early life I found the advantage
of shaving my head, enabling me to keep it cool, when it
was usually in the other condition.</p>

<p>An old Joe Miller was told in Bombay about a certain Duncan
Grey, a Scotch doctor, who was famous for selling hog-mane ponies
to new-comers. He was in medical attendance upon the cadets, and
took the opportunity of pocketing his wig, and persuading them
that shaved heads were the official costume. He accompanied them
for the first official visit, and as they were taking off their caps he
whipped on his wig, and presented to the astonished Commanding
Officer half a dozen utterly bald pates, which looked as if they
belonged to as many lunatics.</p>

<p>My only companion was a bull-terrier of the Oxford breed, more
bull than terrier. Its box-head and pink face had been scratched
all over during a succession of dog-fights and various tussles with
rats. It was beautifully built in the body, and the tail was as thin
as a little finger, showing all the vertebræ. The breed seems to
have become almost extinct, but I found it again at Oxford when
I went there in 1850. The little brute bore a fine litter of pups,
and died in Gujarat, as usual with every sign of old age, half-blind
eyes, and staggering limbs. The pups grew up magnificently. One,
which rejoiced in the name of Bachhûn, received the best of educations.
He was entered necessarily on mice, rats, and <i>Gilahris</i>,
or native squirrels, which bite and scratch like cats. He was so
thoroughly game, that he would sally out alone in the mornings, and
kill a jackal single-handed. He was the pride of the regiment, and
came as usual to a bad end. On one of my journeys, dressed as a
native, I had to leave him behind in charge of my friend Dr. Arnold,
surgeon of the regiment. Dr. Arnold also, when absent, confided him
to the care of a brother-medico, Dr. Pitman, who had strict opinions
on the subject of drugs. The wretch actually allowed the gallant
little dog to die of some simple disease, because he would not give
him a dose of medicine belonging to the Company.</p>

<p>The next thing was to choose a ship, and the aunts were directed
by their friend of the commission, to the <i>John Knox</i> (Captain Richard
B. Cleland), sailing barque, belonging to Messrs. Guy and Co. I
was to embark at Greenwich; the family harem went down with me.
I was duly wept over, and I dropped down the river with the
scantiest regret (except for my relatives) for leaving Europe, on
June 18th, 1842.</p>

<p>My companions were Ensign Boileau, of the 22nd Regiment,
Ensign Thompson, of the Company (line), and Mr. Richmond, going
out to a commercial house in Bombay.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an equal number of the other sex&mdash;a lady calling
herself Mrs. Lewis, and three sturdy wives of sergeants. Fortunately
also, there were three native servants who spoke Hindostani.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Voyage_and_Arrival"></a>The Voyage and Arrival.</i></div>

<p>The voyage began as usual by a straight run down the Channel,
and a June weather passage along the coasts of Europe and Africa.
There were delays in the Doldrums and calms near the Line. Neptune
came on board as usual, but there was very little fun, the numbers
being too small. At such times troubles are apt to break out on
board. The captain, Richard Cleland, was one of the best seamen
that ever commanded a ship, yet his career had been unlucky&mdash;as
Vasco da Gama said to Don Manoel, "Men who are unfortunate at
sea should avoid the affairs of the sea." He had already lost one
ship, which was simply ill-fortune, for no seaman could be more
sober or more attentive to his duty. He managed, however, to have
a row on board, called upon the cadets to load their pistols and
accompany him to the forecastle, where he was about to make a
mutineer a prisoner. These were very disagreeable things to interfere
with, and the Supreme Court of Bombay always did its best to
hang an officer if a seaman was shot on these occasions; one man
in particular had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>The discipline on the ship was none of the best. Captain Cleland
had begun early, and determined to establish a raw, and invited me
to put on the gloves with him. The result was that the tall lanky
Scotchman, who was in particularly bad training, got knocked into
a cocked hat. Then arose the usual troubles amongst the passengers.
Normally on such voyages, all begin by talking together, and end
by talking with themselves. Of course there were love passages,
and these only made matters worse. The chief mate, a great hulking
fellow, who ought to have hit like Tom Spring, but whose
mutton fist could not dent a pat of butter, was solemnly knocked
down on quarter-deck for putting in his oar. Then followed a sham
duel, the combatants being brought up at midnight, and the pistols
loaded with balls of blackened cork instead of bullets. During the
day there were bathings along the ship in a sail, to keep out the
sharks; catching of sharks and flying-fish, and massacring of unhappy
birds. I, however, utilized my time by making the three
native servants who were on board, talk with me, and by reading
Hindostani stories from old Shakespeare's text-book. I made a
final attempt to keep up musical notation, and used the flageolet to
the despair of all on board; but the chief part of my time was passed
in working at Hindostani, reading all the Eastern books on board,
gymnastics, and teaching my brother youngsters the sword. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was also an immense waste of gunpowder, for were not all these
young gentlemen going out to be Commanders-in-Chief?</p>

<p>The good ship <i>John Knox</i> ran past the Cape in winter, and a
magnificent scene it was. Waves measuring miles in length came
up from the South Pole, in lines as regular as those of soldiers
marching over a dead plain. Over them floated the sheep-like
albatrosses, whom the cadets soon tired of shooting, especially when
they found that it was almost impossible to stuff the bird. The little
stormy petrels were respected, but the Cape pigeons were drawn on
board in numbers, with a hook and a bit of bait. Nothing could be
brighter than the skies and seas, and the experience of what is called
"a white gale" gave universal satisfaction. It came down without
any warning, except ploughing up the waters, and had not Captain
Cleland been on deck and let go his gear, most of the muslin would
have been on the broad bosom of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>There was little interest in sailing up the eastern coast of South
Africa. We saw neither the coast nor Madagascar, but struck north-east
for the western coast of India. The usual tricks were played
upon new-comers. They had been made to see the Line by a
thread stretched over a spy-glass, and <i>now</i> they were told to smell
India after a little oil of cloves had been rubbed upon the bulwarks!</p>

<p>When the winds fell, the cadets amused themselves with boarding
the <i>pattymars</i>, and other native craft, and went ferreting all about
the cabins and holes, to the great disgust of the owners. They gaped
at the snakes, which they saw swimming about, and were delighted
when the <i>John Knox</i>, one fine night, lumbered on her way through
nets and fishing stakes, whose owners set up a noise like a gigantic
frog concert. Next morning, October 28th, the Government pilot
came on board; excited questions were put to him, "What was doing
in Afghanistan? What of the war?" At his answer all hopes fell
to zero. Lord Ellenborough had succeeded Lord Auckland. The
avenging army had returned through the Khaybar Pass. The
campaign was finished. Ghuzni had fallen, the prisoners had been
given up. Pollock, Sale, and Pratt had been perfectly successful,
and there was no chance of becoming Commanders-in-Chief within
the year.</p>

<p>I never expected to see another Afghan War, and yet I did so
before middle age was well over.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Thy towers, Bombay! gleam bright, they say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against the dark blue sea,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>absurdly sings the poet. It was no picture like this we saw on the
morning of the 28th of October, 1842, when our long voyage ended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
The bay so celebrated appeared anything but beautiful. It was a
great splay thing, too long for its height, and it had not one of the
beautiful perpendiculars that distinguish Parthenope.</p>

<p>The high background is almost always hid by the reek that rises
during the day, and the sun seems to burn all the colour out of the
landscape. The rains had just ceased, yet the sky seemed never
clear, and the water wanted washing. After this preliminary glance,
the companions shook hands, and, not without something of soreness
of heart, separated, after having lived together nearly five months.
I went to the British Hotel in the Fort, then kept by an Englishman
named Blackwell, who delegated all his duty to a Parsee, and never
troubled himself about his guests. A Tontine Hotel had been long
proposed, but there is a long interval between sayings and doings in
India. The landing in a wretched shore-boat at the unclean Apollo
Bunder, an absurd classicism for Palawa Bunder, was a complete
disenchanter. Not less so to pass through the shabby doorway in the
dingy old fortifications, which the Portuguese had left behind them
when the island was ceded to Charles II. The bright Towers were
nowhere, and the tower of a cathedral that resembled a village
church, seemed to be splotched and corroded as if by gangrene.</p>

<p>Bombay was in those days the most cosmopolitan City in the East,
and the Bhendi Bazaar, the centre of the old town, was the most
characteristic part of all&mdash;perhaps more characteristic than were those
of Cairo or Damascus. It was marvellously picturesque with its
crowds of people from every part of the East, and its utter want of
what is called civilization, made it a great contrast to what it became
a score of years afterwards. Englishmen looked at it with a careless
eye, as a man scours his own property, but foreigners (Frenchmen
like Jacquemont, and Germans like Von Orlich) were delighted with
its various humours, and described them in their most picturesque
style. Everything looked upon a pauper scale.</p>

<p>The first sight of a Sepoy nearly drove me back to the <i>John Knox</i>.
I saw an imitation European article; I saw a shako, planted on the
top of a dingy face, and hair as greasy as a Chinese's. The coat of
faded scarlet seemed to contain a mummy with arms like drumsticks,
and its legs, clad in blue dungaree, seemed to fork from below its
waist; and yet this creature in his national dress, was uncommonly
picturesque, with his long back hair let down, his light jacket of
white cotton, his salmon-coloured waistcloth falling to his
ankles, in graceful folds, and his feet in slippers of bright cloth,
somewhat like the <i>piéd d'ours</i> of the mediæval man-at-arms. The
hotel was an abomination. Its teas and its curries haunted the
censorium of memory for the rest of man's natural life. The rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
were loose boxes, and at night intoxicated acquaintances stood upon
chairs and amused themselves by looking over the thin cloth walls.
I stood this for a few days till I felt sick with rage. I then applied
to the garrison surgeon, in those days Dr. J. W. Ryan, popularly
known as Paddy Ryan.<a name="FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_18" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He was a good-natured man; he enquired
copiously about my Irish relations and connections, knew something of
Lord Trimleston, and removed me from the foul hotel, to what in
those days was called the Sanitarium.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Sanitarium"></a>The Sanitarium.</i></div>

<p>The Sanitarium was a pompous name for a very poor establishment.
About half a dozen bungalows of the semi-detached kind, each with
its bit of compound or yard, fronted in a military line Back Bay, so
famous for wrecks. The quarters consisted of a butt and ben, an
outer room and an inner room, with unattached quarters for servants.
They were places in which an Englishman tolerably well off would
hardly kennel his dogs, and the usual attendants were lizards and
bandicoot rats. As each tenant went away he carried off his
furniture, so it was necessary to procure bed, table, and chairs.
That, however, was easily done by means of a little Parsee broker,
who went by the name of "The General," and who had plundered
generations after generations of cadets. He could supply everything
from a needle to a buggy, or ten thousand rupees on interest, and
those who once drank his wine never forgot it. He was shockingly
scandalized at the sight of my wig. Parsees must touch nothing
that come from the human body.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Moonshee"></a>His Moonshee.</i></div>

<p>He recommended as <i>moonshee</i>, or language-master, a venerable
old Parsee priest, in white hat and beard, named Dosabhai Sohrabji,
at that time the best-known coach in Bombay. Through his hands
also generations of griffins have passed. With him, as with all other
Parsees, Gujarati was the mother tongue, but he also taught Hindostani
and Persian, the latter the usual vile Indian article. He had
a great reputation as a teacher, and he managed to ruin it by publishing
a book of dialogues in English and these three languages,
wherein he showed his perfect unfitness. He was <i>very</i> good, however,
when he had no pretensions, and in his hands I soon got
through the Akhlak-i-Hindi and the Tota-Kaháni. I remained
friends with the old man till the end of his days, and the master
always used to quote his pupil, as a man who could learn a language
running.</p>

<p>The Sanitarium was not pleasantly placed. In latter days the
foreshore was regulated, and a railroad ran along the sea. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
1842 the façade was a place of abominations, and amongst them,
not the least, was the <i>Smashán</i>, or Hindú burning-ground. The fire-birth
was conducted with very little decency; the pyres were built
up on the sands, and heads and limbs were allowed to tumble off,
and when the wind set in the right quarter, the smell of roast
Hindú was most unpleasant. The occupants of the Sanitarium were
supposed to be invalids, but they led the most roystering and
rackety life. Mostly they slept in the open, under mosquito-curtains,
with a calico ceiling, and a bottle of cognac under the
bed. One of these, who shall be nameless, married shortly after,
and was sturdily forbidden by his wife to indulge in night draughts
when he happened to awake. He succumbed, but pleaded permission
to have an earthen gugglet of pure water. The spouse
awoke one night in a state of thirst, which she proceeded to quench,
and was nearly choked by a draught of gin-and-water compounded
in what are called nor'-wester proportions, three of spirit to one of
water. One of the invalids led me into all kinds of mischief,
introducing me to native society of which the less said the better.</p>

<p>The Governor of Bombay at the time was Colonel Sir George
Arthur, Bart, K.C.H., who appears in "Jack Hinton, the Guardsman."
He was supposed to be connected with the Royal Family through
George IV., and had some curious ideas about his visitors "backing"
from the "Presence." The Commander-in-Chief was old Sir
Thomas Macmahon, popularly called "Tommy." He was one of
the old soldiers who had served under the Duke of Wellington, who
had the merit of looking after his friends, as well as looking up his
enemies; but he was utterly unfit for any command, except that of
a brigade. It would be impossible to tell one tithe of the stories
current about him. One of his pet abominations was a certain
Lieutenant Pilfold, of the 2nd Queen's, whose commanding officer,
Major Brough, was perpetually court-martialling. Pilfold belonged
to that order of soldiers which is popularly called "the lawyer," and
invariably argued himself out of every difficulty. Pilfold was first
court-martialled in 1840, then 1841, and 1844, when, after being nearly
cashiered, he changed into a regiment in Australia, and died. At
last he revenged himself upon the Commander-in-Chief by declaring
that "as hares go mad in March, so Major-Generals go mad in
May"&mdash;the day when "Tommy" confirmed one of the court-martials,
that was quashed from home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Indian_Navy"></a>Indian Navy.</i></div>

<p>The Bombay Marine, or, as the officers preferred it to be called,
"The Indian Navy," had come to grief. Their excellent superintendent,
Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm, was a devoted geographer;
in fact, he was the man who provoked the saying, "Capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
speaking evil, even of the Equator." Under his rule, when there
was peace at sea, the officers were allowed ample leave to travel
and explore in the most dangerous countries, and they did brilliant
service. Their names are too well known to require quotation.
But Sir Charles was succeeded by a certain Captain Oliver, R.N., a
sailor of the Commodore Trunnion type, and a martinet of the first
water. He made them stick to their monotonous and wearisome
duties in the Persian Gulf, and in other places, popularly said to be
separated by a sheet of brown paper. He was as vindictive as he
was one-ideaed, and the service will never forget the way in which
he broke the heart of an unfortunate Lieutenant Bird.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="English_Bigotry"></a>English Bigotry.</i></div>

<p>Captain Cleland, of the <i>John Knox</i>, had introduced me to his
sister, Mrs. Woodburn, who was married to an adjutant of the 25th
Regiment of Sepoys, and she kindly introduced me to Bombay
society. I stood perfectly aghast in its presence. The rank
climate of India, which produces such a marvellous development of
vegetation, seems to have a similar effect upon the Anglo-Indian
individuality. It shot up, as if suddenly relieved of the weight with
which society controls it in England. The irreligious were marvellously
irreligious, and the religious no less marvellously religious.
The latter showed the narrowest, most fanatic, and the most intolerant
spirit; no hard-grit Baptist could compare with them. They looked
upon the heathen around them (very often far better than themselves)
as faggots ready for burning.<a name="FNanchor_3_19" id="FNanchor_3_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_19" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They believed that the
Parsees adored the sun, that the Hindús worshipped stocks and
stones, and that the Mohammedans were slaves to what they called
"the impostor Mahomet." They were not more lenient to those
of their own blood who did not run on exactly the same lines with
them. A Roman Catholic, as they called him, was doomed to
perdition, and the same was the case with all non-church-going
Protestants. It is hardly to be wondered at if, at times, they lost
their wits. One man, who was about the wildest of his day, and
who was known as the "Patel" of Griffin-gaon, suddenly got a
"call." He used to distinguish himself by climbing a tree every
morning, and by shouting with all his might, "Dunga Chhor-do,
Jesus Christ, Pakro," meaning, "Abandon the world, and catch
hold of the Saviour." This lasted for years, and it ended in his
breaking down in the moral line, and dying in a mad-house.</p>

<p>The worst of all this was, that in 1842, there were very few white
faces in Bombay, and every man, woman, and child knew his, her, or
its religious affairs, as well as their own. It was, in fact, a garrison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
not a colony. People lived in a kind of huge barracks. Essentially
a middle-class society, like that of a small county town in England,
it was suddenly raised to the top of a tree, and lost its head accordingly.
Men whose parents in England were small tradesmen, or
bailiffs in Scotland, found themselves ruling districts and commanding
regiments, riding in carriages, and owning more pounds a month
than their parents had pounds a year. Those who had interest,
especially in Leadenhall Street, monopolized the best appointments,
and gathered in clans at the Residency, as head-quarters were called.
They formed the usual ring&mdash;a magic circle into which no intruder
was admitted, save by the pain <i>fort et dure</i> of intermarriage. The
children were hideously brought up, and, under the age of five, used
language that would make a porter's hair stand on an end. The
parents separated, of course, into cliques. At that time Bombay
was ruled by two Queens, who in subaltern circles went by the name
of "Old Mother Plausible," and "Old Mother Damnable."</p>

<p>To give a taste of "Mother Damnable's" quality: I had been waltzing
with a girl, who, after too much exertion, declared herself fainting.
I led her into what would at home be called the cloak-room, fetched
her a glass of water, and was putting it to her lips, when the old
lady stood at the door. "Oh dear! I never intended to interrupt
you," she said, made a low bow, and went out of the room, positively
delighted. "Mother Plausible's" style was being intensely respectable.
She was terribly "exercised" about a son at Addiscombe, and carefully
consulted every new cadet about his proficiency in learning.
"But does he prefer the classics?" she asked a wild Irishman. "I
don't know that he does," was the answer. "Or mathematics?" The
same result. "Or modern languages?" "Well, no!" "Then what
does he do?" "Faix," said the informant, scratching his head for
an idea, "he's a very purty hand at football."</p>

<p>But it was not only Society that had such an effect upon me. I
found the Company's officers, as they were called, placed in a truly
ignoble position. They had double commissions, and signed by
the Crown, and yet they ranked with, but after, their brothers and
cousins in the Queen's service. Moreover, with that strange superciliousness,
which seems to characterize the English military service,
and that absence of brotherhood which distinguishes the Prussian
and Austrian, all seemed to look down upon their neighbours. The
Queen's despised the Company, calling them armed policemen,
although they saw as much, if not much more service, than the
Queen's in India. The Artillery held its head above the Cavalry,
the Cavalry above the Line, and, worse still, a Company's officer
could not, except under very exceptional circumstances, rise above a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
certain rank. Under the circumstances, I ventured to regret that
I had not entered the Duke of Lucca's Guards. India had never
heard of the Duke of Lucca, or his Guards, and when they heard
the wild idea&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Their inextinguished laughter rent the skies."</span><br />
</p>

<p>For instance, they had no hopes of becoming local Commanders-in-Chief,
and the General Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies
was carefully put out of their reach. None but Englishmen would
have entered such a service under such conditions. A French <i>piou-piou</i>,
with his possible marshal's bâton in his knapsack, would have
looked down upon it with contempt; but England, though a fighting
nation, is not a military people, or rather <i>was</i> not until Louis
Napoleon made it necessary that they should partially become so.
At the end of six weeks or so, I received orders to join my regiment,
which was then stationed at Baroda, in Gujarat. In those days there
were no steamers up the coast, and men hired what were called
<i>pattymars</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_20" id="FNanchor_4_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_20" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As the winds were generally northerly, these tubs often
took six weeks over what a civilized craft now does in four days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Engages_Servants"></a>Engages Servants.</i></div>

<p>The happy family embarked from Bombay. I preferred engaging
Goanese-Portuguese servants, as they were less troublesome than
Hindús and Mussulmans. I had engaged an excellent <i>buttrel</i>,
named Salvador Soares, who was <i>major domo</i> over the establishment,
for at that time a subaltern never had less than a dozen servants.
The sail northwards, with all its novelties, was delightful, and I made a
point of landing every evening to see all that I could see upon the way.
And so I had my first look at Bassein, Broach, and Surat, the latter a
kind of nursery of the Anglo-Indian Empire. After a fortnight or so
the <i>pattymar</i> reached the Tankaria-Bunder, the mud-bank where
travellers landed to reach Baroda. Then came the land march of four
days, which was full of charms for a Griffin. I had utterly rejected
the so-called Arab horses&mdash;bastard brutes from the Persian Gulf&mdash;which
were sold at the Bombay bomb-proofs then at extravagant prices
of five hundred rupees, now doubled, and had contented myself with
Kattywar horses. This was a bright dun, with black stripes and stockings,
a very vicious brute, addicted to all the sins of horseflesh, but
full of spirit as a thoroughbred. Master and horse got on thoroughly
well, and the gallant animal travelled everywhere, till it was killed on
the Neilgherry Hills by a heavy fall on its side on the slippery clay.
The marching was at the rate of about twelve or fifteen miles a day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and the leisure hours gave ample opportunity of seeing everything on
and off the road.</p>

<p>To the traveller from Europe, Gujarat in winter was a novel
spectacle. The ground, rich black earth, was almost flat, and was
covered with that vivid leek-like verdigris green, which one associates
with early spring in the temperates. The little villages, with their
leafy huts, were surrounded and protected by hedge milk-bush, green
as emeralds, and nothing could be more peaceful or charming than
the evening hour, when the flocks and herds were returning home,
and the villagers were preparing for supper and sleep, with a sky-blue
mist overhanging the scene. A light veil, coloured like Damascene
silver, hung over each settlement, and the magnificent trees,
compared with which the oaks in Hyde Park appeared like shrubs,
were tipped by peacocks screaming their good-night to the sun. How
curious that the physiologist will assert that the nose has no memory!
That light cloud was mostly composed of cow-chips smoke, and I
could never think of Gujarat without recalling it; even the bazar
always suggested spices and cocoa-nut oil.</p>

<p>Again I was scandalized by the contrast of the wretched villages
under English rule, and those that flourished under the Gaikwar.
After the boasting of Directorial speeches, and their echoes in the
humbug press, I could not understand this queer contrast of fiction
and fact. I made inquiries about it from every one, and immensely
disgusted the Company's Resident, Mr. Boyd, by my insistence, but
a very few weeks explained the matter to me. The Anglo-Indian
rule had no elasticity, and everything was iron-bound; it was <i>all rule</i>
without exception. A crack young Collector would have considered
himself dishonoured had he failed to send in the same amount of
revenues during a bad season, as during the best year. It was quite
different with the natives. After a drought or an inundation, a village
would always obtain remission of taxes, it being duly understood
that a good harvest would be doubly taxed, and this was the simple
reason why the natives preferred their own to foreign rule. In the
former case they were harried and plundered whenever anything was
to be got out of them, but in the mean time they were allowed to
make their little piles. Under the English they were rarely tortured,
and never compelled to give up their hardly won earnings, but they
had no opportunity of collecting the wherewithal for plunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Reaches_Baroda_Brother_Officers"></a>Reaches Baroda&mdash;Brother Officers.</i></div>

<p>On the fourth day I arrived at my head-quarters, Baroda, and found
myself lodged in the comfortless travellers' bungalow. Here I was
duly inspected by my brother officers&mdash;Major H. James, then commanding
the 18th Bombay Native Infantry, Captain Westbrooke,
second in command, Lieutenant MacDonald, who was married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Lieutenant and Adjutant Craycroft, Lieutenant J. J. Coombe, Ensign
S. N. Raikes, and Assistant-Surgeon Arnott, and a few others
present. One wing of the corps, containing a greater number
of officers, had been stationed for some time at Mhow, on the
borders of the Bengal Presidency, and the rest, as usual in those
days, were on the Staff, that is, on detached employment, some
in Civil employ, and others in the Corps called Irregulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Mess"></a>Mess.</i></div>

<p>The first night at Mess was an epoch, and the old hands observed
that I drank no beer. This was exceptional in those days. Malt liquor
had completed the defeat of brandy pawnee and the sangaree (sherry,
etc., with water, sugar, and spices) affected by a former generation,
and beer was now king. The most moderate drank two bottles a
day of strong bottled stuff supposed to have been brewed by Bass
and Allsopp, but too often manipulated by the Parsee importer.
The immoderate drank a round dozen, not to speak of other liquors.
The messes in those days were tolerably rich, and their <i>godowns</i>,
or stores, generally contained a fair supply of port, sherry, and
Madeira. "Drink beer, think beer" is essentially true in India.
Presently the bloating malt liquor began to make way for thin French
wines, claret, and Burgundy, and a quarter of a century afterwards,
the Anglo-Indian returned to brandy pawnee with a difference. The
water was no longer plain water, but soda-water, that is, carbonic-acid
gas pumped into well water, and every little station had its own
manufactory. Consequently the price declined from eighteenpence
to twopence a bottle, and most men preferred the "peg," as it is called,
which is probably one of the least harmful. I adhered manfully to a
couple of glasses of port a day. Paddy Ryan at Bombay had told me
that the best tonic after fever, was a dozen of good port. I soon
worked out the fact, that what would cure fever, might also prevent it,
and consequently drank port as a febrifuge. It was the same with me
on the West Coast of Africa, where during four years of service I came
off well, when most other men died.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Drill"></a>Drill.</i></div>

<p>I was duly introduced to the drill-ground, where I had not much
to learn. Yet I studied military matters with all my might, for the
ominous words "tail of the Afghan storm" were in many men's
mouths. I had taught myself, with the assistance of books, the
mysteries of goose-step and extension movements, and perpetual
practice with the sword had made the other manœuvres easy to
me. Having lodged myself in what was called a bungalow, a
thatched article not unlike a cowshed, and having set up the slender
household, I threw myself with a kind of frenzy upon my studies. I
kept up the little stock of Arabic that I had acquired at Oxford,
and gave some twelve hours a day to a desperate tussle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Hindostani. Two <i>moonshees</i> barely sufficed for me. Sir Charles
J. Napier in 1842 was obscurely commanding at Poonah. Presently
he was appointed to the Command in Sind, and all those who knew
the old soldier looked forward to lively times. Brevet-Major Outram,
of the 23rd N.I., had proceeded to England on December 13th,
1842, and had returned to India in February, 1843. This rapid
movement also had an ominous sound. The military day was then
passed in India as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Men rose early, for the sun in India keeps decent hours (not like
the greater light in England, which in summer seems to rise shortly
after midnight, and in winter shortly before noon). The first proceeding
was a wash in cold water and a cup of tea. After that the
horse was brought round saddled, and carried the rider to the drill-ground.
Work usually began as soon as it was light, and lasted till
shortly after sunrise. In the Bengal Presidency the officers used to
wash their teeth at three a.m., and scarcely ever saw the face of the
sun. Consequently the Qui-hyes, or Bengalis, died like sheep upon
a march where much exposure was necessary.</p>

<p>In India the sun requires a little respect. It is not wise, for
instance, to wade through cold water with the rays beating upon the
upper part of the body, but it is always advisable to accustom one's
self to sunshine. After the parade was over, the officers generally
met at what was called a coffee shop, where one of the number hung
out <i>Choti-hazri</i> or little breakfast&mdash;tea or <i>café au lait</i>, biscuit, bread
and butter, and fruit. After that, the heavy work of the day being
done, each proceeded to amuse himself as he best could; some to
play at billiards, others for a day's sport.</p>

<p>Some few youths in the flush of Griffinhood used to mount their
tattoos (ponies) and go out "peacocking," that is to say, calling upon
officers' wives. With the usual Indian <i>savoir vivre</i>, visiting hours
were made abominable. Morning calls began at eleven o'clock,
when the <i>beau sexe</i> was supposed to be in war-paint, and ended at
two, when it was supposed to sit down to tiffin. The ride through
the burning sun, followed by a panting <i>ghorewalla</i>, and the self-preservation
in a state of profuse perspiration, were essentials of
peacocking, which soon beat off the most ardent admirers of the
white fair sex. The latter revenged itself for anything like neglect
in the most violent way, and the consequence was that, in those days,
most men, after their first year, sought a refuge in the society of the
dark fair. Hence in the year of grace 1842 there was hardly an
officer in Baroda who was not more or less morganatically married
to a Hindí or a Hindú woman. This could be a fertile ground for
anecdote, but its nature forbids entering into details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>These irregular unions were mostly temporary, under agreement
to cease when the regiment left the station. Some even stipulated
that there were to be no children. The system had its advantages
and disadvantages. It connected the white stranger with the country
and its people, gave him an interest in their manners and customs,
and taught him thoroughly well their language. It was a standing
joke in my regiment that one of the officers always spoke of himself
in the feminine gender. He had learnt all his Hindostani from his
harem. On the other hand, these unions produced a host of half-castes,
mulattos, "neither fish nor fowl, nor good red herring," who
were equally despised by the races of both progenitors.</p>

<p>Baroda was not a great place for pig-sticking. The old grey boars
abounded, but the country was too much cut up by deep and perpendicular
hillocks, which were death to horse and man. I invested
in an old grey Arab, which followed the game like a bloodhound,
with distended nostrils, and ears viciously laid back. I began, as
was the cruel fashion of the day, by spearing pariah dogs for practice,
and my first success brought me a well-merited accident. Not
knowing that the least touch of the sharp leaf-like head is sufficient
to kill, I made a mighty thrust with my strong-made bamboo shaft,
which was carried under the arm, Bombay fashion, not overhand, as
in Bengal. The point passed through the poor brute and deep into
the ground. The effect of the strong elastic spear was to raise
me bodily out of the saddle, and to throw me over the horse's head.
It was a good lesson for teaching how to take first blood. The
great centres for pig-sticking were in the Deccan and in Sind. The
latter, however, offered too much danger, for riding through tamarisk
bushes is much like charging a series of well-staked fishing-nets.
Baroda, however, abounded in wild beasts; the jackals screamed
round the bungalows every night, and a hyæna once crossed, in
full day, the parade ground. One of the captains (Partridge) cut it
down with his regimental sword, and imprudently dismounted to
secure it. The result was a bite in the arm which he had reason
long to remember.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Sport"></a>Sport.</i></div>

<p>The sport all about Baroda was excellent, for in the thick jungle
to the east of the City, tigers were to be shot, and native friends would
always lend their elephants for a day's work. In the broad plains to
the north, large antelopes, called the <i>nilghai</i>, browsed about like
cows, and were almost as easy to shoot, consequently no one shot
them. It was different with the splendid black buck, sly and wary
animals, and always brought home in triumph. Cheetahs, or hunting
leopards, were also to be had for the asking. As for birds, they were
in countless numbers, from the huge adjutant crane, and the <i>sáras</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
(<i>antigoni</i>), vulgarly called <i>Cyrus Gries antigone</i>, which dies if its
mate be shot, and the peacock, which there, as in most parts of
India, is a sacred bird, to the partridge, which no one eats because
it feeds on the road, the wild duck, which gives excellent shooting,
and the snipe, equal to any in England. During the early rains
quails were to be shot in the compounds, or yards, attached to the
bungalows. In fact, in those days, sensible men who went out
to India took one of two lines&mdash;they either shot, or they studied
languages.</p>

<p>Literature was at a discount, although one youth in the Bombay
Rifles was addicted to rhyme, and circulated a song which began
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'Tis merry, 'tis merry in the long jungle grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When the Janwars around you fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To think of the slaughter that you will commit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On the beasts that go passing by"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>this being the best stanza of the whole.</p>

<p>The 18th Bombay Infantry was brigaded with the 4th Regiment,
<i>alias</i> Rifles, under the command of Major C. Crawley. These
Sepoys, in their dingy green uniform, which seemed to reflect itself
upon their chocolate-coloured cheeks, looked even worse than those
dressed in red.</p>

<p>There was also a company called Golandaz, a regular native
artillery, commanded by a Lieutenant Aked. Gunners are everywhere
a peculiar race, quite as peculiar as sailors. In India they
had the great merit of extreme attachment to their weapons,
which, after a fashion, they adored as weapons of destruction.
"One could hit a partridge with a gun like this," said a pink-faced
youngster to a grizzly old cannonier. "A partridge!" cried the
veteran. "This does not kill partridges; it smashes armies, slaughters
Cities, and it would bring down Shiva himself." And in Baroda City
the Gaikwar had two guns, to which regular adoration was offered.
They were of massive gold, built around steel tubes, and each was
worth about £100,000. Yet the company of Native Artillery was
utterly absurd in European eyes. Nothing more beautiful than the
Gujarat bullocks, with their noble horns and pure white coats.
Europe has seen them in the <i>cascine</i> of Tuscany. But it was truly
absurd to see these noble animals dragging a gun into position at
a shambling and dislocated trot. Satirical subalterns spoke of the
"cow batteries." In these days all, of course, are horsed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Society"></a>Society.</i></div>

<p>There was no such thing as society at Baroda. The Station was
commanded by an old Brigadier, named Gibbons, who had no wife,
but a native family. He was far too infirm to mount a horse; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
never received, ignored dinners either at home or abroad, and lived
as most General Officers did in those days. But he managed to get
into a tremendous row, and was removed from his Command for
losing his temper, and beating a native Chief of the Bazar about the
head, with a leg of mutton.</p>

<p>Hospitalities used to be exchanged between the corps on certain
ceremonious occasions, but a Mess dinner was the extent of
sociability. As in all small Societies, there were little tiffs, likings,
and dislikings. But the age of duelling had passed away, especially
after the fatal affairs of Colonel Fawcet of the 55th Regiment, and
his brother-in-law, Mr. Monro.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Feeding"></a>Feeding.</i></div>

<p>A most pernicious practice, common in those days, was that of
eating "tiffin"&mdash;in other words, a heavy luncheon&mdash;at two, which
followed the normal breakfast, or <i>pakki-hazri</i>, at nine. Tiffin was
generally composed of heavy meats and the never-failing curry,
washed down with heavy bottled beer, was followed by two or three
Manilla cheroots, and possibly by a siesta. Nothing could be more
anti-hygienic than this. It is precisely the same proceeding by
which the liver of the Strasbourg goose is prepared for <i>pâté de foie
gras</i>. The amount of oxygen present in the air of India, is not
sufficient to burn up all this carbon, hence the dingy complexions
and the dull dark hair which distinguished Anglo-Indians on their
return home. I contented myself with a biscuit and a glass of port,
something being required to feed the brain, after the hard study of
many hours.</p>

<p>The French in India manage these things much better. They
keep up their natural habits, except that they rise very early, take
a very light meal, chiefly consisting of <i>café noir</i>, and eat a heavy
breakfast at eleven. Between that and dinner, which follows sunset,
they rarely touch anything, and the consequence is that they return
with livers comparatively sound. But Anglo-Indian hours of meals
were modelled upon those of England, and English hours are laid
down by the exigencies of business. Hence the Briton, naturally
speaking, breakfasts at nine. As he rises late and has little appetite
at that hour, he begins the work of the day upon such a slender
basis as tea, bread and butter, an egg, or a frizzle of bacon. It
was very different in the days of Queen Elizabeth, as certainly the
beefsteaks and beer produced a stronger race. But in those days all
rose early and lived much in the open air.</p>

<p>During the fine weather there was generally something to do on
the parade ground, shortly before sunset, after which the idlers
mounted their nags and took a lazy ride. The day ended at
Mess, which was also characteristically Indian. It was a long table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
in the Mess bungalow, decorated with the regimental plate, and
surmounted by creaking punkahs, that resembled boards horizontally
slung, with a fringe along the lower part. A native, concealed
behind the wall, set these unpleasant articles in movement,
generally holding the rope between two toes. At the top of the
table sat the Mess President, at the bottom the Vice, and their duty
was to keep order, and especially to prevent shop-talking. The
officers dressed like so many caterpillars in white shell-jackets, white
waistcoats, and white overalls, were a marvellous contrast to the
gorgeous Moslem <i>Khidmatgars</i>, who stood behind them, with
crossed arms, turbans the size of small tea-tables, waist-shawls in
proportion. The dinner consisted of soup, a joint of roast mutton
at one end, and boiled mutton or boiled fowls at the other, with
vegetables in the side dishes. Beef was never seen, because the
cow was worshipped at Baroda, nor was roast or boiled pork known
at native messes, where the manners and customs of the unclean
bazar pig were familiar to all, and where there were ugly stories
about the insults to which his remains were exposed on the part of
the Mohammedan scullions. At times, however, a ham made its
appearance, disguised under the name of "Wilayati Bakri," <i>Anglicè</i>
"Europe mutton."</p>

<p>This substantial part of the dinner always concluded with curry,
accompanied by dry fish, Bombay ducks, and <i>papris</i> (assafœtida
cake). Anglo-Indians appreciate curry too much to allow it, as in
England, to precede other dishes, and to rob them of all their
flavour. After this came puddings and tarts, which very few men
touched, as they disagreed with beer, and cheese, which was a
universal favourite. Coffee, curious to say, was unknown, ice was
rare, except at the Residency, and tin vegetables, like peas and
asparagus, had only lately been invented. Immediately after cheese,
all lit their cigars, which in those days were invariably Manillas.
They cost only twenty rupees a thousand, so few were driven to
the economy of the abominable Trichinopoly, smoked in Madras.
Havanas were never seen, pipes were as little known, and only the
oldsters had an extensive article, with a stand two feet high and a
pipe twenty feet long, in which they smoked a mixture called
Guraku. This was a mingling of tobacco, with plantains, essence of
roses, and a dozen different kinds of spices, that gave a very peculiar
perfume. The Hookah was, however, then going out of fashion, and
presently died the death. It is now as rarely seen in Anglo-India,
as the long <i>chibouque</i> at Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Nautch"></a>Nautch.</i></div>

<p>The Mess dinner sometimes concluded with a game of whist, but
a wing of a native Corps had not officers enough to make it interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
After a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of cheroots and spirits and water, the
members of the Mess broke up, and strolled home, immensely enjoying
the clear moonlight, which looked as if frost were lying on the
emerald green of Gujarat. On festive occasions there was a <i>Nach</i>,
which most men pronounced "Nautch." The scene has often been
described in its picturesque aspect. But it had a dark side. Nothing
could be more ignoble than the two or three debauched and drunken
musicians, squealing and scraping the most horrible music, and the
<i>figurantes</i> with Simiad or apish faces, dressed in magnificent brocades,
and performing in the most grotesque way. The exhibition gave
one a shiver, yet not a few of the old officers, who had been brought
up to this kind of thing, enjoyed it as much as the Russians, of the
same epoch, delighted in the gypsy <i>soirées</i> of Moscow, and ruined
themselves with Madeira and Veuve Clicquot.</p>

<p>It was very different during the rains, which here, as in most parts
of the western lowlands of India, were torrential, sometimes lasting
seven days and seven nights, without an hour's interruption. The
country was mostly under water, and those who went to Mess had
to protect themselves with waterproofs; and if they wished to save
their horses from the dangerous disease called <i>barsáti</i>, had to walk
to and fro with bare legs and feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Reviews"></a>Reviews.</i></div>

<p>This even tenor of existence was varied by only two things. The
first was the annual reviews, when old General Morse came over
from Ahmedabad to inspect the Corps, preparations for which ceremony
had been going on for a couple of months. These old officers
were greatly derided by the juniors, chiefly because their brains
seemed to have melted away, and they had forgotten almost everything
except drill, which they had learnt in their youth. This old
General in particular prided himself upon his Hindostani, and
suffered accordingly. "How would you say 'Tell a plain story,'
General?" "Maydan-ki bát bolo"&mdash;which means, "Speak a word
of a level country."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Races"></a>Races.</i></div>

<p>Another great event were the annual Races. Even here, however,
there was a division of the small Society. They were encouraged
by the Company's Resident, Mr. Boyd, and by Major Henry Corsellis,
who had come up with his wife to take command of the
regiment. They were discouraged, on the other hand, by Major
Crawley, of the 4th Rifles, who invariably had a picnic during the
Race week. The reason, however, was not "principle," but some
quarrel about an old bet. I was one of the winners at the Welter
Stakes, having beaten an experienced rider, Lieutenant Raikes.</p>

<p>The state of things at Baroda was not satisfactory. The French
govern their colonies too much, the English too little. The latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
instead of taking their stand as the Masters, instead of declaring,
<i>Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas,</i> seemed, in Baroda at
least, to rule on sufferance: they were thoroughly the Masters of
the position; they could have superseded the Gaikwar, or destroyed
the town in a week. But the rule of the Court of Directors was not
a rule of honour.</p>

<p>The officers in Cantonments, distant only half an hour's ride
from the Palace, were actually obliged to hire <i>rámosis</i> (Paggis) to
protect their lives and properties. These men were simply professed
thieves, who took blackmail to prevent their friends and
relations from plundering. In the bungalows, on the borders of
the camp, a couple of these scoundrels were necessary. In two
bungalows, officers had been cut down, and the one in which I
lived showed, on the door-lintel, sabre cuts. Officers were constantly
robbed and even murdered when travelling in the districts,
and the universally expressed wish was, that some Director's son
might come to grief, and put an end to this miserable state of things.
Now, these things <i>could</i> have been put a stop to by a single dispatch
of the Court of Directors to the Resident at Baroda. They had only
to make the Gaikwar and the Native Authorities answerable for the
lives and property of their officers. A single hanging and a few
heavy fines would have settled the business once and for ever; but,
I repeat, the Government of the Court of Directors was not a rule of
honour, and already the hateful doctrine was being preached, that
"prestige is humbug."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Cobden_and_Indian_History"></a>Cobden and Indian History.</i></div>

<p>The officers marvelled at the proceedings of their Rulers, and
marvelled without understanding things. Little could they know
what was going on at home. Here Mr. Richard Cobden, one of the
most single-sided of men, whose main strength was that he embodied
most of the weakness, and all the prejudice, of the British middle-class
public, was watching the affairs of India with a jealous and
unfriendly eye, as a Military and Despotic Government, as an acquisition
of impolitic violence and fraud, and as the seat of unsafe finance.
India appeared to him utterly destitute of any advantage either to the
natives or to their foreign masters.</p>

<p>He looked upon the East India Company in Asia as simply
monopoly, not merely as regards foreigners, but against their own
countrymen. He openly asserted that England had attempted an
impossibility in giving herself to the task of governing one hundred
millions of Asiatics. Rumours of an Asiatic war were in the air,
especially when it was known that Lieut.-Colonel Stoddart and
Captain Conolly had been foully murdered by the Amir of Bokhara.
He declared (as if he had been taken into supernatural confidence),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that God and His visible Natural Laws have opposed insuperable
obstacles to the success of such a scheme. His opinion as a
professional reformer was, that Hindostan must be ruled by those
that live on that side of the globe, and that its people will prefer
to be ruled badly by its own colour, kith, and kin, than subject
itself to the humiliation of being better governed by a succession of
transient intruders from the Antipodes. He declared that ultimately,
of course, Nature (of which he knew nothing) will assert the supremacy
of her laws, and the white skins will withdraw to their own
latitudes, leaving the Hindús to the enjoyment of the climate, for
which their dingy skins are suited.</p>

<p>All this was the regular Free-trade bosh, and the Great Bagsman
would doubtless have been thunderstruck, had he heard the Homeric
shouts of laughter with which his mean-spirited utterances were
received by every white skin in British India. There was not a
subaltern in the 18th Bombay N.I. who did not consider himself
perfectly capable of governing a million Hindús. And such a conviction
realizes itself&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"By the sword we won the land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And by the sword we'll hold it still;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>for every subaltern felt (if he could not put the feeling into words)
that India had been won, <i>despite England</i>, by the energy and bravery
of men like himself. Every history tells one so in a way that all can
understand. The Company began as mere traders, and presently they
obtained the right of raising guards to defend themselves. The
guards naturally led to the acquisition of territory. The territory
increased, till its three centres, Bengal, Madras, and Bombay,
became centres of little Kingdoms.</p>

<p>The native Princes were startled and frightened. They attacked
their energetic neighbours, with more or less success, and the intruders
became more intrusive than before. Next day they began
to elect Governors, and Governor-Generals. Whenever a new man
was sent out from England, the natives, after the fashion of their
kind, thought that they saw an opportunity, and, losing their fear of
the old Governor, declared war against the new one. The latter
assembled an army, and duly reported the fact home. It took
from eight to nine months before the document was received and
answered. The general tone of the reply was a fierce diatribe
against territorial aggrandizement, but in the mean time a great
battle or two had been fought, a province had been conquered and
duly plundered, and a large slice of territory had been added to
Anglo-Indian rule. This is the way in which British Empire in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
East arose, and probably this was the least objectionable way.
For when the Company rose to power, it began to juggle native
Princes out of their territory, to deny the right of adopting a sacred
privilege amongst the Hindús, and to perpetrate all kinds of injustice.
A fair example was the case of the Rajah of Patara, and
the same proceedings in Oudh, led to the celebrated Mutiny in
1857, and nearly wrecked British dominion in India.</p>

<p>At last a bright day dawned. The whole of the little Cantonment
was electrified by the news of the battle of Meeanee, which had been
fought on February 21st, 1843. After a number of reverses truly
humiliating to British self-esteem, the Sun of Victory had at last
shone upon her bayonets. Sir Charles Napier had shown that, with
a little force of mixed Englishmen and Sepoys, he could beat the
best and bravest army that any Native Power could bring into the
field. It was a gallant little affair, because the few white faces had
done nearly the whole work. The Sepoys, as usual, had behaved like
curs, and five of their officers had been killed, to one of the Queen's
service.</p>

<p>Then, on March 25th, followed the battle of Dabba, and Sind
fell into the power of the English, and Major Outram returned
to England on April 1st. Then arose the great quarrel between
the two great men. The general opinion of the time was, that
the Bayard of India, as his future enemy had called him, wished
<i>himself</i> to depose the Ameers, and resented the work being done by
another. His (Major Outram's) own writings show, that he found
them unfitted to rule, and that he had proposed the most stringent
remedies. But when these were carried out by another man, he
ranged himself in the ranks of the opposition. Sir Charles Napier
and his free-spoken brother, Sir William, had been bitterly opposed
to the twenty-four little Kings in Leadenhall Street, and had never
hesitated to express their opinions. One of their energetic dicta
was, that every rupee has a blood-spot on it, and that wash as you
will, the cursed spot will not out. Talking of which, by-the-by, I, in
one of those pungent epigrams, which brought me such abundance
of "good will (?)," wrote as follows, referring to the £60,000 which
Sir Charles Napier cleared by way of prize money:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Who, when he lived on shillings, swore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rupees were stained with Indian gore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And 'widows' tears' for motto bore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But Charley?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And yet who, in the last five years,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So round a sum of that coin clears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In spite of 'gore' and 'widows' tears,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">As Charley?"</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Major Outram again left India for England. The Court of
Directors persuaded him to become their champion, against their
old enemy, Sir Charles Napier. The latter was very strong, for he
was thoroughly supported by the new Governor-General (Lord
Ellenborough), in opposition to all others, and thoroughly identified
himself with the Army, and the Army adored him accordingly. One
of his sayings, "<i>Kacheri</i> (or Court-House) hussar," alluding to the
beards or the mustachios of the civilians, caused a perfect tornado
of wrath amongst the black coats of India. He was equally free-spoken
in his condemnation of the politicals. The Court of
Directors did not dare to recall him at once, but they riled with
impotent rage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Somnath_Gates"></a>Somnath Gates.</i></div>

<p>Amongst other cabals that they brought against him was the
affair of the Somnath Gates. Few people understood the truth of
the question in that day, and most who did, have not forgotten it.
These famous doors, which had been carried off in the year A.D.
1023 from a Hindú temple in Gujarat by the great warrior, Mahmoud
of Ghazni, had been matters of dispute years before Lord Ellenborough's
time. As early as 1831, when Shah Shuja was in treaty
with Runjeet Singh, of the Panjab, for aid to recover his throne, one
of the conditions of the latter, was the restoration of the Gates of
Somnath. Probably the Rajah, like the Governor-General, was utterly
ignorant of the fact that the ruins of the Moon Temple have entirely
perished. On that occasion, however, the Shah reminded the Hindú
of an old prophesy which foreboded the downfall of the Sikh empire,
or the withdrawal of the Gates from the warrior's tomb at Ghazni.
They were removed to India at the end of 1842, and in September,
1843, the Sikh empire practically collapsed with the murder of Sher
Singh&mdash;a curious case of uninspired prophecy. The Gates were
removed by General Mott, acting under the orders of the Governor-General,
on March 10th, 1843; they were deposited in Agra, where
they were kept, and may even now be kept, in an old palace in the
Fort, formerly used as an arsenal by the British.<a name="FNanchor_5_21" id="FNanchor_5_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_21" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The venerable
relics ought long ago to have been sent to the South Kensington
Museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Outram_and_Napier"></a>Outram and Napier.</i></div>

<p>The feud between Sir Charles Napier and Major Outram, divided
Western Anglo-India into two opposing camps. Major Outram
belonged to a family of mechanics, from whose name came the
tramways, and he had begun his service in the Bombay marine. He
was presently transferred to the Native Infantry, and carved out a
career for himself. His peculiar temperament gave him immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
power amongst the wild Bhíls and other tribes, whom he had been
sent, as it were, to civilize. He was a short, stout man, anything
but prepossessing in appearance, but of immense courage and most
violent temper. A story is told concerning him and his brother, who,
in a dispute at a tiger-hunt, turned their rifles against each other.
He hated to be outdone, or even to be equalled. On one occasion,
when he found a man who could spring into the lake, off the house
terrace, like himself, he made a native raise him upon his shoulders,
and so managed to outdo the rival jumper. He was immensely
generous and hospitable, living quite in the native way, with a troupe
of <i>Nach</i> girls to pass the evening. He always acted upon impulse,
and upon generous impulses. On one occasion, when marching
past, at the head of his troops, he was grossly insulted by a villager,
whereupon he turned to and administered condign chastisement to
the villagers. When transferred to Sind, he had denounced the
Ameers in the severest way; in fact, his account of them, as political,
seemed to justify their being dethroned. But, as I said, when that
operation was performed by another than himself, he suddenly turned
round and denounced the deed. He was a Scotchman, and was by no
means wanting in that canniness which teaches a man which side his
bread carries the butter. He was thoroughly impressed with the
axiom that "bluid is thicker than water," and always promoted, if he
could, the interests of a countryman, to the detriment of others. Sir
Charles Napier, on the other hand, belonged to that exceptional order
of Scotchmen, who are chiefly remarkable for having nothing of the
Scotchman about them. He was utterly deficient in prudence, he
did not care a fig how many enemies he made, and his tongue was
like a scorpion's sting. He spoke of Sir James Hogg as "that
Hogg," alluding to the Hindostani word <i>suar</i> ("pig"), one of the
most insulting words in the language. He spoke of Dr. Buist, a
Scotch editor at Bombay, as "the blatant beast of the Bombay
<i>Times</i>." In fact, he declared war to the knife.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Outram's friends were not idle. He had a
large party of his own. Men liked his courage, his generosity, his
large-heartedness, and his utter disregard for responsibility. He
could also write, in a dull, thick style, it is true, but thoroughly
intelligible to the multitude, and quite unlike the style, like polished
steel, that was so doughtily used by Sir William Napier. Become
a politician, the "Bayard" did not improve; in fact, two or three
dodges were quoted about him which added very little to his
reputation. I had no reason to like him. In his younger days,
thirsting for distinction, Outram was ambitious to explore the
Somali country, then considered the most dangerous in Africa, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
when I proposed to do so, he openly opposed me. This was, however,
perhaps natural, as he was then commanding at Aden.</p>

<p>As soon as I had passed my drill I was placed in charge of a
Company, and proceeded to teach what I had just learnt. I greatly
encouraged my men in sword exercise, and used to get the best
players to my quarters for a good long bout every day. The usual
style in India is a kind of single-stick, ribbonded with list cloth, up
to the top, and a small shield in the left hand. The style of work
seems to have been borrowed from the sword-dance of some civilized
people, like the Bactrian-Greeks. The swordsman begins with
"renowning it," vapouring, waving his blade, and showing all the
curious <i>fantasie</i> that distinguish a Spanish Espada. Then, with the
fiercest countenance, he begins to spring in the air, to jump from
side to side, to crouch and to rush forwards and backwards, with all
the action of an excited baboon. They never thought of giving
"point:" throughout India the thrust is confined to the dagger.
The cuts, as a rule, were only two&mdash;one in the shoulder, and the
other, in the vernacular called <i>kalam</i>, at the lower legs. Nothing
was easier than to guard these cuts, and to administer a thrust that
would have been fatal with steel. I gave a prize every month, to
the best swordsman, wrestler, and athlete, generally some gaudy
turban. But, although I did my best, I never could teach them to
use a foil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_learns_Indian_Riding_and_Training"></a>He learns Indian Riding and Training.</i></div>

<p>These proceedings excited not a little wonder amongst my brother
subs, but much more when I sent for a <i>Chábu Sawar</i>, or native
jockey, and began to learn the Indian system of riding, and of
training the horse. As a rule, this was absurdly neglected in India.
Men mostly rode half-broken Arabs, and many an annual review
showed the pleasant spectacle of a commanding officer being run
away with in one direction, and the second in command in another.
And when it came to meeting Indians in the field, the Englishman
was at a terrible disadvantage. An old story is told of an encounter
between an Indian and English cavalry officer, who had been
offended by the remarks of the former. They charged, sword in
hand, in presence of their regiments, and both were equally skilful
in parrying the enemy's attack; presently, however, the Britisher
found himself in a fix, the native with his sharp light blade having
cut the horse's reins, without hurting either horse or man. This is
a favourite native ruse. Whereupon the English officer drew his
pistol and disloyally shot the Indian, who in his lingering illness,
which ended fatally, declared that he never meant to hurt the
English officer, but only to prove his own words, that he was not
his equal in swordsmanship or horsemanship. Light chains were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
afterwards adopted to accompany the leather bridle. The English
officer deeply regretted the event, and it was hushed up; but such
acts are never quite buried.</p>

<p>A similar manslaughter took place during one of the Sind campaigns.
An officer, who shall be nameless, attacked a Beluch
chief, who, being mounted upon a tired mare, made no attempt to
fly. The Englishman, who had some reputation as a swordsman,
repeatedly bore down upon him, making a succession of cuts, which
the opponent received upon his blade and shield. At last, being
unable to win fairly, the Englishman, who is now high in command,
drew his pistol and shot him, and, curious to say, was not court-martialled!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Passes_Exams_in_Hindostani"></a>Passes Exams. in Hindostani.</i></div>

<p>At last I considered myself thoroughly qualified to pass in
Hindostani, and in early April, 1843, obtained leave from the Commander-in-Chief
to visit Bombay for the purpose of examination. I
made the same march from Baroda to Tankaria-Bunder, and then
found a <i>pattymar</i> for Bombay. The sail southwards, despite the
extraordinary heat of the season, was perfectly charming. The
north-east monsoon, about drawing to its end, alternated with the
salt sea-breeze and the spicy land-breeze, the former justly called
"The Doctor." The sky was deep blue, unflecked by a single cloud,
and the sea bluer, still hardly crisped by the wind. There was
perfect calm inside and outside the vessel. No posts and no
parades. The living was simple enough, consisting chiefly of rice,
curry and <i>chapatís</i>, with the never-failing tea and tobacco. Tea in
India is better than in England, although of inferior quality, because
it has less sea voyage. The native servants, however, have a peculiar
way of brewing it, and those who have once drunk a sneaker, or
double-sized cup, full of Indian tea, will never forget it. Sensible
men, therefore, brew their tea for themselves.</p>

<p>Despite landing almost every evening, the voyage down coast
occupied only six or seven days. This time I hired a tent, with the
aid of the old Parsee General, and pitched in the Strangers' Lines.
They extended southwards from the Sanitarium, along the shore of
Back Bay, and were not, as now, huddled up into a little space on
the other side of the road. With the assistance of old Dosabhai
Sohrabji I worked up the last minutiæ of the language, and on
May 5th appeared in the Town Hall, where the examinations were
held.</p>

<p>These were not without a certain amount of difficulty. The
candidate was expected to make a written translation, to read and
translate <i>vivâ voce</i> from a native book, to read a written letter, often
vilely scrawled, and to converse with the <i>moonshee</i>, Mohammed Makba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a Concani Mussulman, whose son I afterwards met in 1876. I was
fortunate in my examiner. Captain Pope, who formerly held that
position, had been made Assistant-Commissary-General, and could
no longer indulge his pet propensity of plucking candidates. The
committee was composed of Major-General Vans-Kennedy and three
or four nobodies. The former was an Orientalist after a fashion,
knew a great deal of books, and much more of native manners and
customs. In fact, he lived in their society, and was, as usual, grossly
imposed upon. Whenever a servant wanted "leave," he always
begged permission to leave a <i>badli</i>, or substitute, to do his work, and
when number one returned, number two remained. Consequently,
the old man was eaten up by native drones. He lived amongst
his books in a tumble-down bungalow, in a tattered compound,
which was never repaired, and he had a slight knowledge of Sanscrit
and Arabic, an abundant acquaintance with Hindostani and Persian,
and general Oriental literature.</p>

<p>The one grievance of his life was his treatment by Sir John
(afterwards Lord) Keane. This Western barbarian came out to
India when advanced in years, and, imbued with a fine contempt
"of the twenty-years-in-the-country-and-speak-the-language man,"
he could not understand what was the use of having officers who
did nothing but facilitate the study of Orientalism, and he speedily
sent off Colonel Vans-Kennedy to join his regiment. The latter
was deeply in debt, as usual, under his circumstances; his creditors
tolerated him at the Presidency, where they could lay ready claws
upon his pay, but before he could march up country, he was
obliged to sell, for a mere nothing, his valuable library of books
and manuscripts, which had occupied him a lifetime in collecting.
He was a curious spectacle, suggesting only a skeleton dressed in
a frock-coat of worn-out blue cloth uniform, and he spoke all his
languages with a fine broad lowland accent, which is, perhaps,
Orientally speaking, the best.</p>

<p>I passed my examination the first of twelve. Next to me was
Ensign Robert Gordon, of the 4th Bombay Rifles, and Ensign Higginson,
of the 78th Highlanders. The latter brought to the Examination
Hall one of the finest Irish brogues ever heard there. I had been
humble enough before I passed, but, having once got through, I
was ready to back my knowledge against the world. This was no
great feat on my part, as I had begun Arabic at Oxford, and worked
at Hindostani in London, and on board the ship, and had studied
for twelve hours a day at Baroda. Before I quitted the Presidency,
I had an unpleasantness with a certain Dr. Bird, a pseudo-Orientalist,
who, after the fashion of the day, used the brains of <i>moonshee</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<i>pandit</i> to make his own reputation. I revenged myself by lampooning
him, when, at the ripe age of forty-five, he was about to take to
himself a spare-rib. The line began&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"A small grey bird goes out to woo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Primed with Persian ditties new;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the gardens straight he flew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where he knew the rosebud grew."</span><br />
</p>

<p>We afterwards met in London, and were very good friends.</p>

<p>Dr. Bird only regretted that he had wasted his time on native
languages, instead of studying his own profession. He practised
medicine for a short time in London, and died.</p>

<p>I left Bombay on May 12th, and rejoined my regiment just before
the burst of the south-west monsoon. This was a scene that has
often been described in verse and prose. It was a prime favourite
with the Sanscrit poets, and English readers are familiar with it
through Horace Hayman Wilson's Hindú theatre. But the discomforts
of the season in a cowshed-like bungalow were considerable;
you sat through the day in a wet skin, and slept through the night
with the same. The three months were an alternation of steaming
heat and damp, raw cold.</p>

<p>The rains are exceptionally heavy in Gujarat, and sometimes
the rainpour lasted without interval for seven days and seven
nights. This is mostly the case in the lowlands of India, especially
at Bombay and other places, where the Gháts approach the coast.
Throughout the inner plateau, as at Poonah, the wet season,
which the Portuguese call winter, with its occasional showers and
its bursts of sunshine, is decidedly pleasant. The brown desolation
of the land disappears in a moment, and is replaced by a
brilliant garb of green. The air is light and wholesome, and the
change is hailed by every one; but at Baroda there were torments
innumerable. The air was full of loathsome beings, which
seemed born for the occasion&mdash;flying horrors of all kinds, ants
and bugs, which persisted in intruding into meat and drink. At
Mess it was necessary to have the glasses carefully covered, and it
was hardly safe to open one's mouth. The style of riding to a
dinner has been already described. There was no duty, and the
parade-ground was a sheet of water. Shooting was impossible,
except during the rare intervals of sunshine; and those who did not
play billiards suffered from mortal <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>I now attacked with renewed vigour the Gujarati language, spoken
throughout the country, and by the Parsees of Bombay and elsewhere.
My teacher was a Nagar Brahman, named Him Chand. Meanwhile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>I took elementary lessons of Sanscrit, from the regimental <i>pandit</i>.
Every Sepoy Corps, in those days, kept one of these men, who was a
kind of priest as well as a schoolmaster, reading out prayers, and
superintending the nice conduct of Festivals, with all their complicated
observances. Besides these men, the Government also supplied
schoolmasters, and the consequence was, that a large percentage of
young Sepoys could read and write. I once won a bet from my
brother-in-law Stisted, by proving that more men in the 18th Bombay
Native Infantry than in the 78th Queen's could read and write. In
the latter, indeed, they occasionally had recruits who could not
speak English, but only Gaelic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Receives_the_Brahminical_Thread"></a>Receives the Brahminical Thread.</i></div>

<p>Under my two teachers I soon became as well acquainted, as a
stranger can, with the practice of Hinduism. I carefully read up
Ward, Moor, and the publications of the Asiatic Society, questioning
my teachers, and committing to writing page after page of notes, and
eventually my Hindú teacher officially allowed me to wear the <i>Janeo</i>
(Brahminical thread). My knowledge, indeed, not a little surprised
my friend Dr. H. G. Carter, who was secretary to the Asiatic Society
at Bombay. On June 26th, 1843, I was appointed interpreter to
my regiment, which added something&mdash;a few rupees, some thirty a
month&mdash;to my income. My brother officers now began to see that
I was working with an object. When I returned from Bombay, they
had been surprised at my instantly resuming work, and not allowing
myself a holiday. They grumbled not a little at having so unsociable
a messmate.</p>

<p>About that time, too, I began to acquire the ominous soubriquet
of "The White Nigger," and what added not a little to the general
astonishment was, that I left off "sitting under" the garrison Chaplain,
and transferred myself to the Catholic Chapel of the chocolate-coloured
Goanese priest, who adhibited spiritual consolation to the
<i>bultrels</i> (butlers and head-servants) and other servants of the camp.<a name="FNanchor_6_22" id="FNanchor_6_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_22" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
At length, on August 22nd, 1843, I again obtained leave "to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>proceed to Bombay to be examined in the Guzerattee language."
This time I was accompanied on the journey by Lieutenant R. A.
Manson, who was on like business, to the Presidency. The march
was detestable. We could hardly ride our horses through the
sticky and knee-deep mud of Gujarat. So we fitted up native carts
with waterproof tilts, and jogged behind the slow-paced steers on
the high-road to Broach. Here we found a detachment of a native
Corps, living the usual dull, monotonous life.</p>

<p>Hence we proceeded to Surat, once the cradle of the British
power in India, and afterwards doomed to utter neglect. Its
masterful position for trade secured it from utter ruin, but no thanks
to its rulers. Here we again took a <i>pattymar</i>, and dropped down
the river, <i>en route</i> to the Presidency. But this time it was very
different voyaging. The south-west monsoon was dead against us,
and nothing could be more ominous than the aspect of the weather.
We reached Bombay on September 26th, just in time to avoid the
<i>Elephanta</i>, or dangerous break up of the rainy monsoon. Little
Manson, who had been wrecked when coming out in Back Bay, was
in an extreme state of nervousness, and I was prepared for any
risk when I saw the last sheets of lightning hung out by the purple-black
clouds. The examination took place on October 16th, 1843,
again in presence of old General Vans-Kennedy and the normal
three or four nobodies, and I again passed first, distancing my
rival, Lieutenant C. P. Rigby, of the 16th Bombay N.I. I wished
to remain in Bombay to await my regiment, then under orders for
Sind, but on the 10th of November I was ordered north, and yet
the corps had received orders to march on November 23rd.</p>

<p>The break up of the Cantonment produced all manner of festivities.
The two Corps took leave of one another, and passed the last
night in the enjoyment of a stupendous <i>Nach</i>, or Nautch.
</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="On_the_March"></a>On the March.</i></div>

<p>A March with a regiment in those days was a pleasure. The first
bugle sounded shortly after midnight, and presently came the
signal&mdash;<br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Don't you hear the general say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Strike your tents and march away'?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>After a few days' practice, the camp was on the ground and ready
packed for starting on carts and camels, within a few minutes.
Naturally loose marching was the rule. The men were only expected
to keep in Companies, and the officers, with rifles in their
hands, rode before, behind, or alongside of them. In this way many
a head of game made its appearance at the regimental Mess. The
Marches seldom exceeded fifteen miles a day; at the end of the
stage the Sepoys were drawn up into line, inspected, and told off to
pitching the tents. Breakfast was generally eaten by the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
shortly after sunrise, and the morning air gave fine appetites. The
food was generally carried in a <i>dúli</i>, a kind of portable palanquin,
primarily intended for the sick and wounded. After the tents were
pitched most men were glad to have a short sleep. They assembled
again at Tiffin, and its objectionable properties disappeared during
the march. They then amused themselves with shooting, or strolling
about the country, till Mess hour. The officers' wives were always
present at dinner, and no smoking was allowed until they had disappeared.
After mess, men were only too glad to turn in, and to get
as much sleep as they could before the morning bugle.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked in a native craft at Tankaria-Bunder,
and on December 26th, 1843, encamped on the Esplanade, Bombay.
They were in the highest spirits, for all expected to see service. The
wing from Mhow had been ordered to rejoin head-quarters, and the
same was the case with the Staff officers, Captains Jamieson and
Partridge, Lieutenants MacDonald, Hough, Compton, and Ensign
Anderson. Needless to say that the latter were in high dudgeon at
leaving their fat appointments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Embarks_for_Sind"></a>Embarks for Sind.</i></div>

<p>On New Year's Day of 1844, the corps embarked on board the
H.E.I. Company's steamship <i>Semiramis</i>, generally known as the
"Merry Miss." She was commanded by Captain Ethersey, who ended
badly. His "'aughtiness," as the crew called it, won him very few
friends. And now I come to the time when I began to describe my
experiences in print. The first chapter of "Scinde; or the Unhappy
Valley" gives a facetious account of this voyage.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Semiramis</i> I made a good friend in Captain Walter
Scott, of the Bombay Engineers, who had been transferred from
Kandesh, to take charge of the Survey in Lower Sind, by general
order of November 23rd, 1843. He was a handsome man in the
prime of life, with soft blue eyes, straight features, yellow hair, and
golden-coloured beard. Withal he not a little resembled his uncle,
"The Magician of the North," of whom he retained the fondest
remembrance. He preserved also the trick, wholly unintentional,
of the burr and the lisp, the former in the humorous parts, and the
latter in the tenderer part of his stories. He was an admirable conversationist,
and his anecdotes were full of a dry and pawky
humour, which comes from north of the Tweed. Yet, curious to say,
when he took pen in hand his thoughts seemed to fly abroad. His
lines were crooked, and his sentences were hardly intelligible.
Something of this was doubtless owing to his confirmed habit of
cheroot smoking, whilst he was writing, but it was eminently
characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>Walter Scott was a truly fine character. His manners were those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of a gentleman of the Old School, and he never said a disagreeable
word or did an ungraceful deed. A confirmed bachelor, he was not
at all averse to women's society; indeed, rather the contrary. He
was generous, even lavish to the extreme, and he was quite as ready
to befriend an Englishman, as a "brither Scot." These two latter
qualities seemed to distinguish a high-bred Scotchman, whilst the
English and Irish gentleman preserved the characteristics of his
nationality, of course refining it and raising it to the highest standard.
The Scottish gentleman seems to differ not only in degree, but in
kind, and to retain only the finer qualities of his race. This is not
speaking of the aristocracy, but of the finer nature, which is the
nature of a true gentleman. Whereas the common herd errs in
excess of canniness and cautiousness, keeps a keen eye upon the
main chance, and distrusts everything and everybody. The select
few are rather rash than otherwise, think less of gain than of a point
of honour, and seem to believe all other men as true-hearted and
high-spirited as themselves, as well as utterly destitute of religious
fanaticism.</p>

<p>Walter Scott's favourite reading was old history and romance. He
was delighted to meet with a man who was acquainted with
Hollingshed and Froissart. Moreover, he had sent to Italy for a
series of books upon the canalization of the valley of the Po, and was
right glad to find a man who had been in that part of the world, and
could assist him by his knowledge of Italian. And I capped the
good effect I had upon him, by quoting some of the finest of his
uncle's lines, which end with&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I bless thee, and thou shalt be blessed."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The little voyage, beautiful outside the ship, and stiff and prim
within, ended on the fourth day. The <i>Semiramis</i> ran past Manora
Head and anchored near the Bar, which in those days was as bad
as bad could be. My first impressions of the country, a marvellous
contrast to Gujarat and Bombay, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Karachi_Sind"></a>Karáchi, Sind.</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"In those days Sind was in the most primitive state. The town,
or rather village, of Karáchi was surrounded by a tall wall of guy
swish, topped with fancy crenelles, and perpendicularly striped with
what the Persians call <i>Da mágheh</i>, or nostril holes, down which
the besieged could pour hot oil, or boiling water. Streets there
were none; every house looked like a small fort, and they almost
met over the narrow lanes that formed the only thoroughfares. The
bazar, a long line of miserable shops, covered over with rude matting
of date leaves, was the only place comparatively open. Nothing
could exceed the filthiness of the town; sewers there were none.
And the deodorization was effected by the dust. The harbour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
when the tide was out, was a system of mud-flats, like the lagoons
of Venice, when you approach them by the Murazzi. A mere
sketch of a road, which in these days would be called a Frere
highway, led from the nearest mud-bank to the Cantonment. The
latter was in its earliest infancy. The ground of hard clay was still
covered with milk-bush and desert vegetation, and only here and
there a humble bungalow was beginning to be built. There was no
sign of barracks, and two race-courses were laid out before any one
thought of church or chapel.</p>

<p>"Yet Karáchi showed abundant sign of life. Sir Charles Napier
thoroughly believed in its future, and loudly proclaimed that in a
few years it would take the wind out of Bombay sails. The old
Conqueror himself was temporarily staying there. He had his wife
and two handsome daughters. His personal staff was composed of
his two nephews, Captain William Napier and Lieutenant Byng.
In his general Staff he had Major Edward Green, Assistant Adjutant-General,
for Quarter-Master-General; Captain MacMurdo, who afterwards
married his daughter; a civilian named Brown, <i>alias</i> 'Beer'
Brown; Captain Young, of the Bengal army, as his Judge Advocate-General;
and Captain Preedy for his Commissary-General. The
latter was the son of a violent old officer in the Bombay army, and
of whom many a queer story was told. One of them is as follows:&mdash;He
was dining at a Dragoon mess at Poonah, when they began to
sing a song which had been written by an officer of the regiment,
and which had for refrain&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Here's death to those<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who dare oppose<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her Majesty's Dragoons.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>Old Preedy well knew that in the affair alluded to, the Dragoons,
having ventured into a native village, had been soundly thrashed
by the villagers. After patiently hearing the song out, he proposed
to give the villagers a turn, but he had hardly finished his first
verses&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Success to who<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dare to bamboo<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her Majesty's Dragoons.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>before he was duly kicked out of the Mess.</p>

<p>"Karáchi was then swarming with troops. The 78th Highlanders
were cantoned there, and were presently joined by the 86th, or 'County
Down Boys.' Both consumed a vast quantity of liquor, but in
diametrically different ways. The kilts, when they felt fou, toddled
quietly to bed, and slept off the debauch; the brogues quarrelled
and fought, and made themselves generally disagreeable, and passed
the night in the guard-house. There was horse artillery and foot
artillery, and the former, when in uniform, turned out in such
gorgeous gingerbread-gold coats, that gave a new point to the old
sneer of 'buying a man at your own price, and selling him at his
own,' and there were native regiments enough to justify brigade
parades on the very largest scale."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The 18th was presently ordered off to Gharra, a desolate bit of
rock and clay, which I described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Look at that unhappy hole&mdash;it is Gharra.</p>

<p>"The dirty heap of mud-and-mat hovels that forms the native
village is built upon a mound, the <i>débris</i> of former Gharras, close to
a creek which may or may not have been the 'western outlet of the
Indus in Alexander's time.' All round it lies a&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'windy sea of land:'&mdash;<br /></span>
</p>

<p>salt, flat, barren rock and sandy plain, where eternal sea-gales blow
up and blow down a succession of hillocks&mdash;warts upon the foul face
of the landscape&mdash;stretching far, far away, in all the regular irregularity
of desolation.</p>

<p>"You see the cantonment with its falling brick lines outside, and
its tattered thatched roofs peeping from the inside of a tall dense
hedge of bright green milk-bush."</p></blockquote>

<p>We were obliged to pitch tents, for there was no chance of lodging
in the foul little village, at the head of the Gharra creek. Under
the circumstances, of course, the work was very hard.</p>

<p>A sandstorm astonished an English visitor considerably.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When we arose in the morning the sky was lowering, the air
dark; the wind blew in puffs, and&mdash;unusual enough at the time of
the year&mdash;it felt raw and searching. If you took the trouble to look
towards the hills about eight a.m. you might have seen a towering
column of sand from the rocky hills, mixed with powdered silt from
the arid plains, flying away as fast as it could from the angry puffing
Boreas.</p>

<p>"The gale increases&mdash;blast pursuing blast, roaring and sweeping
round the walls and over the roofs of the houses with the frantic
violence of a typhoon. There is a horror in the sound, and then
the prospect from the windows! It reminds one of Firdausi's vast
idea that one layer has been trampled off earth and added to the
coats of the firmament. You close every aperture and inlet, in the
hope of escaping the most distressing part of the phenomenon.
Save yourself the trouble, all such measures are useless. The finer
particles with which the atmosphere is laden would pass without
difficulty through the eye of a needle; judge what comfortable
thoroughfares they must find the chinks of these warped doors and
the crannies of the puttyless munnions.</p>

<p>"It seems as though the dust recognized in our persons kindred
matter. Our heads are powdered over in five minutes; our eyes,
unless we sit with closed lids, feel as if a dash of cayenne had been
administered to them; we sneeze like schoolboys after a first pinch
of 'blackguard;' our epidermises are grittier than a loaf of provincial
French bread, and washing would only be a mockery of
resisting the irremediable evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Bull, if you wish to let your friends and old cronies at
home see something of the produce of the East, call for a lighted
candle, and sit down to compose an 'overland letter.' It will take
you at least two hours and a half to finish the four pages, as the pen
becomes clogged, and the paper covered every few minutes; moreover,
your spectacles require wiping at least as often as your quill
does. By the time the missive comes to hand it will contain a neat
little cake of Indus mud and Scinde sand moulded in the form of
paper. Tell Mrs. Bull that you went without your tiffin&mdash;lunch I
mean&mdash;that you tried to sleep, but the novel sensation of being
powdered all over made the attempt an abortive one&mdash;that it is
impossible to cook during a dust-storm&mdash;and that you are in for a
modification of your favourite 'intramural sepulture,' if the gale
continues much longer. However, your days are safe enough; the
wind will probably fall about five or six in the afternoon,&mdash;it is rare
that it does not go down with the sun&mdash;and even should it continue
during the night, it will be a farce compared to what we are enduring
now."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was great excitement on June 20th, 1844, when the Sepoys
of the 64th Regiment mutinied at Shikapur and beat their officers.
The station was commanded by Major-General Hunter, C.B. Most
of his experience was in studs. When campaigning with Sir Charles
Napier, the latter sent to him for something to eat, and the reply
was a ham and a round of press beef. The "devil's brother," as
the Sindís called him, cut a slice out of the ham and another out
of the beef, and then sent the remainder back to the owner. On
June 27th a general order established vernacular examination, making
it every officer's duty to learn something more or less of the
language. In September I went down to Bombay to pass an examination
in Maharátta, and on October 15th I distanced some six
competitors.</p>

<h4>THE REMINISCENCES WRITTEN FOR MR. HITCHMAN IN 1888&mdash;INDIA.</h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Later_Chapter_on_same_events_differently_told"></a>A Later Chapter on same events differently told.</i></div>

<p>When I landed at Bombay (October 28th, 1842), "Momba
Devi" town was a marvellous contrast with the "Queen of Western
India," as she thrones it in 1887; no City in Europe, except perhaps
Vienna, can show such a difference. The old Portuguese port-village
<i>temp. Caroli Secundi</i>, with its silly fortifications and useless
esplanade, its narrow alleys and squares like <i>places d'armes</i>, had not
developed itself into "Sasson-Town," as we may call the olden, and
"Frére-Town" the modern moiety.</p>

<p>Under the patriarchal rule of the Court of Directors to the Hon.
East Indian Company, a form of torpidity much resembling the
paternal government of good Emperor Franz, no arrangements were
made for the reception of the queer animals called "cadets." They
landed and fell into the knowing hands of some rascals; lodged at
a Persian tavern, the British Hotel, all uncleanliness at the highest
prices. I had a touch of "seasoning sickness," came under the
charge of "Paddy Ryan," Fort Surgeon and general favourite, and
was duly drafted into the Sanitary Bungalow&mdash;thatched hovels facing
Back Bay, whence ever arose a pestilential whiff of roast Hindú, and
opened the eyes of those who had read about the luxuries of the
East. Life was confined to a solitary ride (at dawn and dusk), a
dull monotonous day, and a night in some place of dissipation&mdash;to
put it mildly&mdash;such as the Bhendi bazar, whose attractions consisted
of dark young persons in gaudy dress, mock jewels, and hair japanned
with cocoa-nut oil, and whose especial diversions were an occasional
"row"&mdash;a barbarous manner of "town and gown." But a few days,
of residence had taught me that India, at least Western India, offered
only two specialities for the Britisher; first <i>Shikar</i> or sport, and
secondly, opportunities of studying the people and their languages.
These were practically unlimited; I found that it took me some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
years of hard study before I could walk into a bazar and distinguish
the several castes, and know something of them, their manners and
customs, religion and superstitions. I at once engaged a venerable
Parsee, Dosabhai Sohrabji, also a <i>mubid</i>, or priest, as his white cap
and coat showed, who had coached many generations of <i>griffs</i>, and
under his guidance dived deep into the "Ethics of Hind" (Akhlak-i-Hindi)
and other such text-books.</p>

<p>This was the year after the heir-apparent was born; when Nott,
Pollock, and Sale revenged the destruction of some 13,000 men by
the Afghans; when the Chinese War broke out; when Lord Ellenborough
succeeded awkward Lord Auckland; and when Major-General
Sir Charles J. Napier, commanding at Poonah, was appointed
to Sind (August 25th, 1842), and when his subsequent unfriend,
Brevet-Major James Outram, was on furlough to England; lastly, and
curious to say, most important of all to me, was the fact that "Ensign
Burton" was ranked and posted in the G. G. O. of October 15th, 1842,
to the 18th Regiment, Bombay N.I.</p>

<p>Nor was I less surprised by the boasting of my brother officers
(the Sepoys had thrashed the French in India and elsewhere, they
were the flower of the British army, and so forth)&mdash;fine specimen of
<i>esprit de corps</i> run mad, which was destined presently to change its
tone, after 1857. Meanwhile this loud brag covered an ugly truth.
We officers of the Indian army held her Majesty's commission,
but the Company's officers were looked upon by the Queen's troops
as mere auxiliaries, locals without general rank, as it were black
policemen. Moreover the rules of the service did not allow us to
rise above a certain rank. What a contrast to the French private,
who carries a Marshal's baton in his knapsack!</p>

<p>Captain Cleland introduced me to his sister, the wife of a field-officer,
and she to sundry of her friends, whose tone somewhat
surprised me. Here and there a reference was made to my
"immortal soul," and I was overwhelmed with oral treatises upon
what was expected from a "Christian in a heathen land." And these
ladies "talked shop," at least, so it appeared to me, like non-commissioned
officers. After <i>Shikar</i> and the linguistics, the only
popular pursuit in India is (I should think always was) "Society."
But indigestible dinners are not pleasant in a Turkish bath; dancing
is at a discount in a region of eternal dog-days; picnics are unpleasant
on the "palm-tasselled strand of glowing Ind," where
scorpions and cobras come uninvited; horse-racing, like Cicero's
"Mercaturi," to be honoured, must be on a large scale; the Mess
tiffin is an abomination ruinous to digestion and health; the billiard-table
may pass an hour or so pleasantly enough, but it becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
monotonous waste of time, and the evening bands, or meet at
"Scandal Point," is open to the charge of a deadly dullness.</p>

<p>Visits become visitations, because that tyrant Madam Etiquette
commanded them about noon, despite risk of sunstroke, and "the
ladies" insisted upon them without remorse of conscience. Needless
to say that in those days the <i>Gym-hánah</i> was unknown, and that
the Indian world ignored lawn-tennis, even croquet.</p>

<p>Another point in Bombay Society at once struck me, and I afterwards
found it in the Colonies and most highly developed in the
United States. At home men and women live under an incubus, a
perfect system of social despotism which is intended to make amends
for an unnatural political equality, amongst classes born radically
unequal. Abroad, the weight is taken off their shoulders, and they
result of its removal is a peculiar rankness of growth. The pious
become fanatically one-idea'd, pharisaical, unchristian, monomaniacal.
The un-pious run to the other extreme, believe nothing, sneer at the
holies, "and look upon the mere Agnostic as a 'slow coach.'"
Eccentricity develops itself Bedlam-wards. One of my friends had a
mania and swore "By my halidom." Another had an image of
Gánpati over his door, which he never passed without the prayer, "Shri
ganeshayá Hamahá" ("I bow to auspicious Janus"). A third, of
whom I heard, had studied Aristotle in Arabic, and when shown the
"Novum Organon," asked, indignantly, "who the fellow might be that
talked such stuff." And in matters of honesty the social idea was
somewhat lax; to sell a spavined horse to a friend was considered a
good joke, and to pass off plated wares for real silver was looked
upon as only a trifle too "smart." The Press faithfully reflected
these nuances with a little extra violence and virulence of its own.
By-the-by, I must not forget making the acquaintance of a typical
Scot, Dr. Buist (afterwards Sir Charles Napier's "blatant beast of
the <i>Bombay Times</i>"). He wrote much (so badly that only one
clerk could read it) and washed little; and as age advanced he
married a young wife.</p>

<p>After a month or so at Bombay, chiefly spent in mugging "Hindostani,"
and in providing myself with the necessaries of life&mdash;servants,
headed by Salvador Soares, a handsome Goanese; a horse, in the shape
of a dun-coloured Kattywár nag; also a "horsekeeper," a dog, a tent,
and so forth&mdash;I received my marching orders and set out to "join"
my own corps. The simple way of travelling in those days before
steam and rail was by palanquin or <i>pattymar</i>. I have described the
latter article in "Goa," and I may add that it had its advantages.
True it was a "slow coach," creeping on seventy or eighty miles a
day, and some days almost stationary; it had few comforts and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
luxuries. I began by actually missing "pudding," and have often
smiled at the remembrance of my stomach's comical disappointment.
<i>En revanche</i>, the study of the little world within was most
valuable to the "young Anglo-Indian," and the slow devious course
allowed landing at places rarely visited by Europeans. During my
repeated trips I saw Diu, once so famous in Portuguese story, Holy
Dwarká, guarded outside by sharks and filled with fierce and fanatic
mercenaries, and a dozen less interesting spots.</p>

<p>The end of this trip was Tankária-Bunder, a small landing in the
Bay of Cambay, a most primitive locale to be called a port, where
a mud-bank, adapted for a mooring-stake, was about the only convenience.
It showed me, however, a fine specimen of the <i>Ghora</i>, or
bore, known to our Severn and other rivers&mdash;an exaggerated high
tide, when the water comes rushing up the shallows like a charge of
cavalry. Native carts were also to be procured at Tankária-Bunder
for the three days' short march to Baroda, and a mattress spread
below made the rude article comfortable enough for young limbs
and strong nerves.</p>

<p>Gujarat, the classical Gujaráhtra, a land of the Gujar clan, which
remained the Syrastrena Regio of Arrian, surprised me by its tranquil
beauty and its vast natural wealth. Green as a card-table, flat as a
prairie, it grew a marvellous growth of trees, which stunted our
English oaks and elm trees&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"to ancient song unknown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The noble sons of potent heat and flood"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>and a succession of fields breaking the glades, of townlets and
villages walled by luxuriant barriers of caustic milk-bush (euphorbia),
teemed with sights and sounds and smells peculiarly Indian. The
sharp bark of Hanu the Monkey and the bray of the <i>Shankh</i> or
conch near the bowery pagoda were surprises to the ear, and less
to the nose was the blue vapour which settled over the hamlets
morning and evening, a semi-transparent veil, the result of <i>Gobar</i>
smoke from "cow-chips." A stale trick upon travellers approaching
India by sea was to rub a little sandal oil upon the gunwale and
invite them to "smell India," yet many a time for miles off shore I
have noted that faint spicy odour, as if there were curry in the air,
which about the abodes of man seems to be crossed with an aroma
of drugs, as though proceeding from an apothecary's store. Wondrous
peaceful and quiet lay those little Indian villages, outlaid by glorious
banyan and pipal trees, topes or clumps of giant figs which rain a
most grateful shade, and sometimes provided by the piety of some
long-departed Chief with a tank of cut stone, a <i>baurá</i> or draw-well
of fine masonry and large dimensions. But what "exercised" not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
a little my "Griffin" thoughts was to note the unpleasant difference
between villages under English rule and those belonging to "His
Highness the Gaikwar" or cowkeeper; the penury of the former and
the prosperity of the latter. Mr. Boyd, the then Resident at the local
court, soon enlightened me upon the evils of our unelastic rule of
"smart Collectors," who cannot and dare not make any allowance
for deficient rainfall or injured crops, and it is better to have something
to lose, and to lose it even to the extent "of being ousted of
possessions and disseized of freehold," with the likely hope of gaining
it again, than to own nothing worth plundering.</p>

<p>The end of the march introduced me to my corps, the 18th
Regiment, Bombay Native Infantry, whose head-quarters were in
Gujarat, one wing being stationed at Mhow, on the Bengal
frontier.</p>

<p>The officer commanding, Captain James (C.V.), called upon me
at the Travellers' bungalow, the rudimentary Inn which must satisfy
the stranger in India, suggesting the while such sad contrast, and
bore me off to his bungalow, formally presented me at Mess&mdash;then
reduced to eight members besides myself&mdash;and the Assistant-Surgeon
Arnott put me in the way of lodging myself. The regimental Mess,
with its large cool Hall and punkahs, its clean napery and bright
silver, its servants each standing behind his master's chair, and the
cheroots and hookahs which appeared with the disappearance of the
"table"-cloth, was a pleasant surprise, the first sight of comfortable
home-life I had seen since landing at Bombay. Not so the Subalterns'
bungalow, which gave the idea of a dog-hole at which British
Ponto would turn up his civilized nose. The business of the day was
mainly goose-step and studying the drill book, and listening to such
equivocal words of command as "Tandelees" (stand at ease) and
"Fiz-bagnat" (fix bayonets). Long practice with the sword, which I
had began seriously at the age of twelve, sometimes taking three
lessons a day, soon eased my difficulties, and led to the study of
native swordsmanship, whose grotesqueness and buffoonery can be
rivalled only by its insufficiency.<a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The wrestling, however, was another matter, and not a few natives
in my Company had at first the advantage of me, and this induced a
trial of Indian training, which consisted mainly of washing down
balls of <i>Gur</i> (unrefined sugar) with bowls of hot milk hotly spiced.
The result was that in a week I was blind with bile. Another set
of lessons suggested by common sense, was instruction by a <i>chábuhsawar</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
or native jockey. All nations seem to despise one another's
riding, and none seem to know how much they have to learn. The
Indian style was the merit of holding the horse well in hand, making
him bound off at a touch of the heel, stopping him dead at a hand
gallop, and wheeling him round as on a pivot. The Hindú will
canter over a figure-of-eight, gradually diminishing the dimensions
till the animal leans over at an angle of 45°, and throwing himself
over the off side and hanging by the heel to the earth, will pick up
sword or pistol from the ground. Our lumbering chargers brought
us to notable grief more than once in the great Sikh War. And as I
was somewhat nervous about snakes, I took lessons of a "Charmer,"
and could soon handle them with coolness.</p>

<p>The <i>Bibi</i> (white woman) was at that time rare in India; the result
was the triumph of the <i>Búbú</i> (coloured sister). I found every officer
in the corps more or less provided with one of these helpmates.</p>

<p>We boys naturally followed suit; but I had to suffer the protestations
of the Portuguese <i>padre</i>, who had taken upon himself the cure
and charge of my soul, and was like a hen who had hatched a
duckling. I had a fine opportunity of studying the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of
the <i>Búbú</i> system.</p>

<p><i>Pros</i>: The "walking dictionary" is all but indispensable to the
Student, and she teaches him not only Hindostani grammar, but the
syntaxes of native Life. She keeps house for him, never allowing
him to save money, or, if possible, to waste it. She keeps the servants
in order. She has an infallible recipe to prevent maternity,
especially if her tenure of office depends on such compact. She
looks after him in sickness, and is one of the best of nurses, and,
as it is not good for man to live alone, she makes him a manner of
home.</p>

<p>The <i>disadvantages</i> are as manifest as the advantages. Presently,
as overland passages became cheaper and commoner, the <i>Bibi</i> won
and the <i>Búbú</i> lost ground. Even during <i>my</i> day, married men
began, doubtless at the instance of their wives, to look coldly
upon the half-married, thereby showing mighty little common sense.
For India was the classic land of Cicisbeism, where husbands are
occupied between ten a.m. and five p.m. at their offices and counting-houses,
leaving a fair field and much favour to the sub unattached,
and whose duty often keeps the man sweltering upon the plains, when
the wife is enjoying the <i>somer-frisch</i> upon "the Hills." Moreover,
the confirmed hypocrite and the respectable-ist, when in power,
established a kind of inquisitorial inquiry into the officer's house,
and affixed a black mark to the name of the half-married. At last
the <i>Búbú</i> made her exit and left a void. The greatest danger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
British India is the ever-growing gulf that yawns between the
governors and the governed; they lose touch of one another, and
such racial estrangement leads directly to racial hostility.</p>

<p>The day in Cantonment-way is lively. It began before sunrise
on the parade-ground, an open space, which any other people but
English would have converted into a stronghold. Followed, the
baths and the <i>choti-hazri</i>, or little breakfast, the <i>munshi</i> (language-master),
and literary matters till nine o'clock meal. The hours were
detestable, compared with the French system&mdash;the <i>déjeuner à la
fourchette</i>, which abolished the necessity of lunch; but throughout the
Anglo-American world, even in the places worst adapted, "business"
lays out the day. After breakfast, most men went to the billiard-room;
some, but very few, preferred "peacocking," which meant
robing in white-grass clothes and riding under a roasting sun, as
near the meridian as possible, to call upon "regimental ladies,"
who were gruff as corporals when the function was neglected too
long. The dull and tedious afternoon again belonged to <i>munshi</i>,
and ended with a constitutional ride, or a rare glance at the band;
Mess about seven p.m., possibly a game of whist, and a stroll home
under the marvellous Gujarat skies, through a scene of perfect loveliness,
a paradise bounded by the whity-black line.</p>

<p>There was little variety in such days. At times we rode to Baroda
City, which seemed like a Mansion, to which the Cantonment acted
as porter's Lodge. "Good Water" (as the Sanskritists translate it)
was a walled City, lying on the north bank of the Vishwamitra river,
and containing some 150,000 souls, mostly hostile, who eyed us with
hateful eyes, and who seemed to have taught even their animals to
abhor us. The City is a <i>mélange</i> of low huts and tall houses, grotesquely
painted, with a shabby palace, and a <i>Chauk</i>, or Bazar, where
four streets meet. At times H.M. the Gaikwar would show us
what was called sport&mdash;a fight between two elephants with cut tusks,
or a caged tiger and a buffalo&mdash;the last being generally the winner&mdash;or
a wrangle between two fierce stallions, which bit like camels.
The cock-fighting was, however, of a superior kind, the birds being
of first-class blood, and so well trained, that they never hesitated to
attack a stranger. An occasional picnic, for hunting, not society,
was a most pleasant treat. The native Prince would always lend us
his cheetahs or hunting leopards, or his elephants; the jungles inland
of the city swarmed with game, from a snipe to a tiger, and the
broad plains to the north were packs of <i>nilghai</i> and the glorious black
buck. About twenty-eight miles due east, rises high above the sea of
verdure the picturesque hill known as Pávangarh, the Fort of Eolus,
and the centre of an old Civilization. Tanks and Jain temples were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
scattered around it, and the ruins of Champenír City cumbered the
base. In a more progressive society, this place, 2500 feet high, and
cooler by 18° to 20° F., would have become a kind of sanitarium.
But men, apparently, could not agree. When the Baroda races came
round, Major C. Crawley, commanding the 4th Bombay Rifles, used,
in consequence of some fancied slight, to openly ride out of cantonment;
and Brigadier Gibbons, the commander, did nothing for
society. But the crowning excitement of the season was the report
of Sir Charles Napier's battle of Miani (February 21st), followed by
the affair of Dubba (March 25th), the "tail of the Afghan War." The
account seemed to act as an electric shock upon the English frame,
followed by a deep depression and a sense of mortal injury at the
hands of Fate in keeping us out of the fray.</p>

<p>At length, in April, 1843, I obtained two months' leave of absence
to the Presidency, for the purpose of passing an examination in
Hindostani. The function was held at the Town Hall. Major-General
Vans-Kennedy presided, a queer old man as queerly dressed, who
had given his life to Orientalism, and who had printed some very
respectable studies of Hinduism. The examining <i>munshi</i>, Mohammed
"Mucklá," was no friend to me, because I was coached by a rival,
old Dosabhai, yet he could not prevent my distancing a field of
eleven. This happened on May 5th, and on May 12th I had laid in
a full supply of Gujarati books, and set out by the old road to rejoin.</p>

<p>If Baroda was dull and dreary during the dries, it was mortal
during the rains. I had been compelled to change my quarters for
a bigger bungalow, close to the bank of the <i>nullah</i> which bounded
the camp to the east and fed the Vishwamitra. It was an ill-omened
place; an English officer had been wounded in it, and the lintel still
bore the mark of a sabre which some native ruffian had left, intending
to split a Serjeant's head. Other quarters in the cantonment were
obliged to keep one <i>ramosi, alias</i> Paggi, a tracker, a temporarily reformed
thief who keeps off other thieves; my bungalow required two.
An ignoble position for a dominant race, this openly paying blackmail
and compounding felony. The rule of the good Company was,
however, not a rule of honour, but of expediency, and the safety of
its officers was little regarded; they were stabbed in their tents,
or cut down by dacoits, even when travelling on the highways of
Gujarat. Long and loudly the survivors hoped that some fine day
a bishop or a Director's son would come to grief, and <i>when this
happened at last</i> the process was summarily stopped. Indeed, nothing
was easier to find than a remedy. A heavy fine was imposed
upon the district in which the outrage was committed. By such
means, Mohammed Ali of Egypt made the Suez Desert safer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a London street, and Sir Charles Napier pacified Sind, and made
deeds of violence unknown&mdash;by means not such as Earl Russell
virtually encouraged the robber-shepherds of Greece to plunder and
murder English travellers.</p>

<p>The monsoon,<a name="FNanchor_2_24" id="FNanchor_2_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_24" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as it is most incorrectly termed, completely
changes the tenor of Anglo-Indian life. It is ushered in by a display
of "insect youth" which would have astonished Egypt in the age of
the plagues, "flying bugs," and so forth. At Mess every tumbler was
protected by a silver lid. And when the downfall begins it suggests
that the "fountains of the great deep" have been opened up. I
have seen tropical rains in many a region near the Line, but never
anything that rivals Gujarati. Without exaggeration, the steady
discharge of water buckets lasted literally, on one occasion, through
seven days and nights without intermission, and to reach Mess we
had to send our clothes on, and to wear a single waterproof, and to
gallop through water above, around, and below at full speed. This
third of the year was a terribly dull suicidal time, worse even than
the gloomy month of November. It amply accounted for the card-table
surface and the glorious tree-clump of the Gujarat&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The mighty growth of sun and torrent-rains."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Working some twelve hours a day, and doing nothing but work,
I found myself ready in later August for a second trip to the
Presidency, and obtained leave from September 10th to October
30th (afterwards made to include November 10th) for proceeding to
Bombay, and being examined in the Guzerattee language.<a name="FNanchor_3_25" id="FNanchor_3_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_25" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This time I resolved to try another route, and, despite the warning
of abominable roads, to ride down coast <i>viâ</i> Baroch and Surat. I
had not been deceived; the deep and rich black soil, which is so
good for the growth of cotton, makes a mud truly terrible to travellers.
Baroch, the Hindú Brighu-Khatia, or Field of Brighú, son of
Brahma, is generally made the modern successor of Ptolemy and
Arrian's "Barygaza," but there are no classic remains to support
the identification of the spot, nor indeed did any one in the place
seem to care a fig about the matter. A truly Hindú town of some
twelve thousand souls on the banks of the Nerbudda, it boasted of
only one sight, the <i>Kabir-bar</i>, which the English translated "Big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Banyan," and which meant, "Banyan-tree of (the famous ascetic and
poet) Das Kabir." I remember only two of his lines&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">"Máyá mare na man mare, mar mar gaya sarir"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">("Illusion dies; dies not the mind, though body die and die")&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Máyá</i> (illusion) being sensuous matter, and old Fakirs express the
idea of the modern Hylozoist,<a name="FNanchor_4_26" id="FNanchor_4_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_26" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "All things are thinks." The old
tree is hardly worth a visit, although it may have sheltered five
thousand horsemen and inspired Milton, for which see the guide-books.</p>

<p>Surat (Surashtra = good region), long time the "Gate of Meccah,"
where pilgrims embarked instead of at Bombay, shows nothing of
its olden splendour.</p>

<p>This was the nucleus of British power on the western coast of
India in the seventeenth century, and as early as May, 1609, Captain
Hawkins, of the <i>Hector</i>, obtained permission at Agra here to
found a factory for his half-piratical countrymen, who are briefly
described as "Molossis suis ferociores." They soon managed to
turn out the Portuguese, and they left a Graveyard which is not
devoid of some barbaric interest&mdash;Tom Croyate of the Crudities,
however, is absent from it. At Surat I met Lieutenant Manson,
R.A. He was going down to "go up" in Maharátta, and we agreed
to take a <i>pattymar</i> together. We cruised down the foul Tapti river&mdash;all
Indian, like West African, streams seem to be made of dirty
water&mdash;and were shown the abandoned sites of the Dutch garden
and French factory, Vaux's Tomb, and Dormus Island. We escaped
an <i>Elephanta</i> storm, one of those pleasant September visitations
which denote the break up of the "monsoon," and which not unfrequently
bestrews the whole coast of Western India with wreckage.
This time I found lodging in the Town Barracks, Bombay, and
passed an examination in the Town Hall before General Vans-Kennedy,
with the normal success, being placed first. The process
consisted of reading from print (two books), and handwriting,
generally some "native letter," and of conversing and of writing
an "address" or some paper of the kind.</p>

<p>Returning Baroda-wards, whence my regiment was transferred to
our immense satisfaction to Sind, I assisted in the farewell revelries,
dinners and <i>Naches</i>, or native dances&mdash;the most melancholy form
in which Terpsichore ever manifested herself.</p>

<p>By far the most agreeable and wholesome part of regimental life
in India is the march; the hours are reasonable, the work not too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
severe, and the results, in appetite and sleep, admirable. At Bombay
we encamped on the Esplanade, and on January 1st, 1844, we
embarked for Karáchi on board the H.E.I.C.'s steamer <i>Semiramis</i>,
whose uneventful cruise is told in "Scinde, or the Unhappy Valley,"
chap. I, "The Shippe of Helle." Yet not wholly uneventual
to me.</p>

<p>On board of the <i>Semiramis</i> was Captain Walter Scott, Bombay
Engineers, who had lately been transferred from commanding in
Candeish to the superintendence of the Sind Canals, a department
newly organized by the old Conqueror of "Young Egypt," and our
chance meeting influenced my life for the next six years. I have
before described him. With short intervals I was one of his
assistants till 1849. We never had a diverging thought, much
less an unpleasant word; and when he died, at Berlin, in 1875, I
felt his loss as that of a near relation.</p>

<p>Karáchi, which I have twice described, was in 1844 a mere stretch
of a Cantonment, and nothing if not military; the garrison consisting
of some five thousand men of all arms, European and native. The
discomfort of camp life in this Sahara,<a name="FNanchor_5_27" id="FNanchor_5_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_27" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which represented the Libyan
Desert, after Gujarat, the Nile Valley, was excessive, the dust-storms
were atrocious,<a name="FNanchor_6_28" id="FNanchor_6_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_28" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the brackish water produced the most unpleasant
symptoms. Parades of all kinds, regimental and brigade,
were the rule, and Sir Charles Napier was rarely absent from anything
on a large scale.</p>

<p>The Conqueror of Scinde was a noted and remarkable figure at
that time, and there is still a semi-heroic ring about the name. In
appearance he was ultra-Jewish, a wondrous contrast to his grand
brother, Sir William; his countrymen called him Fagan, after Dickens,
and his subjects, Shaytan-á-Bhái, Satan's brother, from his masterful
spirit and reckless energy. There is an idealized portrait of him in
Mr. W. H. Bruce's "Life" (London, Murray, 1885), but I much
prefer the caricature by Lieutenant Beresford, printed in my wife's
volume, "A.E.I." Yet there was nothing mean in the Conqueror's
diminutive form; the hawk's eye, and eagle's beak, and powerful
chin would redeem any face from vulgarity.</p>

<p>Sir Charles, during his long years of Peninsular and European
service, cultivated the habit of jotting down all events in his diary,
with a <i>naïveté</i>, a vivacity, and a fulness which echoed his spirit, and
which, with advancing years, degenerated into intemperance of
language and extravagance of statement. He was hard, as were
most men in those days, upon the great Company he termed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
"Twenty-four Kings of Leadenhall Street"&mdash;"ephemeral sovereigns;"
he quoted Lord Wellesley about the "ignominious tyrants
of the East."</p>

<p>In his sixtieth year he was appointed to the command of Poonah
(December 28th, 1841), and he was so lacking in the goods of this
world that a Bombay house refused to advance him £500. He
began at once to study Hindostani, but it was too late; the
lesson induced irresistible drowsiness, and the <i>munshi</i> was too
polite to awaken the aged scholar, who always said he would
give Rs. 10,000 to be able to address the Sepoys. On September
3rd, 1842, he set off to assume his new command in Upper and
Lower Sind, and he at once saw his opportunity. Major Outram
had blackened the faces of the Amirs, but he wanted to keep the
work of conquest for himself, and he did not relish its being done by
another. He, however, assisted Sir Charles Napier, and it was not
till his return to England in 1843 that he ranged himself on the side
of the Directors, whose hatred of the Conqueror grew with his
success, and two factions, Outramists and Napierists, divided the
little world of Western India.</p>

<p>The battles of Miani and Dubba were much criticized by military
experts, who found that the "butcher's bill" did not justify the
magnificent periods of Sir William Napier. This noble old soldier's
"Conquest of Scinde" was a work of <i>fantaisie</i>; the story was
admirably told, the picture was perfect, but the details were so
incorrect, that it became the subject of endless "chaff" even in
Government House, Karáchi. The corrective was an official report
by Major (afterwards General) Waddington, B.O. Eng., which gave
the shady, rather than the sunlit side of the picture. And there is
still a third to be written. Neither of our authorities tell us, nor can
we expect a public document to do so, how the mulatto who had
charge of the Amir's guns had been persuaded to fire high, and how
the Talpur traitor who commanded the cavalry, openly drew off his
men and showed the shameless example of flight. When the day
shall come to publish details concerning disbursement of "Secret
service money in India," the public will learn strange things. Meanwhile
those of us who have lived long enough to see how history is
written, can regard it as but little better than a poor romance.</p>

<p>However exaggerated, little Miani taught the world one lesson
which should not be forgotten&mdash;the sole plan to win a fight from
barbarians, be they Belochis, Kafirs, or Burmese. It is simplicity
itself; a sharp cannonade to shake the enemy, an advance in line or
<i>échelon</i> as the ground demands, and a dash of cavalry to expedite
the runaways. And presently the victory led to organizing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
"Land Transport Corps" and the "Baggage Corps," two prime
wants of the Indian army. Here Sir Charles Napier's skill as an
inventor evolved order out of disorder, and efficiency from the most
cumbrous of abuses. The pacification of the new Province was
marvellously brought about by the enlightened despotism of the
Conqueror. Outram had predicted ten years of guerilla warfare
before peace could be restored; Sir Charles made it safer than any
part of India within a year, and in 1844, when levelling down the
canals, I was loudly blessed by the peasants, who cried out, "These
men are indeed worthy to govern us, as they work for our good."</p>

<p>But Sir Charles Napier began India somewhat too late in life, and
had to pay the penalty. His mistakes were manifold, and some of
them miserable. When preparing for the "Truhkee campaign," he
proposed to content himself with a "<i>Numero-cent</i>" tent for a Commander-in-Chief!
When marching upon Multan, his idea was to
quarter the Sepoys in the villages, which would have been destroyed
at once; and it was some time before his Staff dared put it in this
light.</p>

<p>From over-deference to English opinion, he liberated all the
African slaves in Sind and turned them out to starve; it would have
been wiser to "free the womb," and forbid importation. He never
could understand the "Badli system," where a rich native buys
a poor man to be hanged for him who committed the crime, and
terribly scandalized Captain Young, the civilian Judge Advocate-General,
by hanging the wrong man. Finding that the offended
husband in Sind was justified by public opinion for cutting down
his wife, he sent the unfortunate to the gallows, and the result was
a peculiar condition of society. On one occasion, the anonymas
of Hyderabad sent him a deputation to complain "that the married
women were taking the bread out of their mouths."</p>

<p>Sir Charles was a favourite among the juniors, in fact, amongst all
who did not thwart or oppose him. He delighted in Rabelaisian
<i>bon-mots</i>, and the <i>Conte grivois</i>, as was the wont of field-officers in
his day; his comment upon a newspaper's "peace and plenty at
Karáchi" was long quoted.</p>

<p>After a month of discomfort at Karáchi, rendered more uncomfortable
by the compulsory joining of six unfortunate Staff-officers
who lost their snug appointments in India,<a name="FNanchor_7_29" id="FNanchor_7_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_29" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> we were moved to
Gharra&mdash;"out of the frying-pan into the fire"&mdash;a melancholy hole
some forty miles by road north of Head-quarters, and within hearing
of the evening gun. I have already described its horror.<a name="FNanchor_8_30" id="FNanchor_8_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_30" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
predecessors had not built the barracks or bungalows, and we found
only a parallelogram of rock and sand, girt by a tall dense hedge of
bright green milk-bush, and surrounded by a flat of stone and
gravel, near a filthy village whose timorous inhabitants shunned us
as walking pestilences.</p>

<p>This, with an occasional temperature of 125° F., was to be our
"house" for some years. As I had no money wherewith to build,
I was compelled to endure a hot season in a single-poled tent,
pitched outside the milk-bush hedge; and after, to escape suffocation,
I was obliged to cover my table with a wet cloth and pass the hot
hours under it. However, energy was not wanting, and the regimental
<i>pandit</i> proving a good school-master, I threw away Sindi for
Maráthá; and in October, 1844, I was able to pass my examination
in Maráthá at the Presidency, I coming first of half a dozen. About
this time Southern Bombay was agitated by a small mutiny in
Sáwantwádi, and the papers contained a long service-correspondence
about Colonels Outram and Wallace, the capture of Amanghar, and
Lieutenant Brassy's descent on Shiva Drug. I at once laid in a
store of Persian books, and began seriously to work at that richest
and most charming of Eastern languages.</p>

<p>On return to Karáchi, I found myself, by the favour of my friend
Scott, gazetted as one of his four assistants in the Sind "Survey," with
especial reference to the Canal Department; my being able to read
and translate the valuable Italian works on hydro-dynamics being a
point in my favour. A few days taught me the use of compass,
theodolite, and spirit-level, and on December 10th, 1844, I was sent
with a surveying party and six camels to work at Fulayli (Phuleli)
and its continuation, the Guni river. The labour was not small;
after a frosty night using instruments in the sole of a canal where
the sun's rays seemed to pour as through a funnel, was decidedly
trying to the constitution. However, I managed to pull through,
and my surveying books were honoured with official approbation.
During this winter I enjoyed some sport, especially hawking, and
collected material for "Falconry in the Valley of the Indus."<a name="FNanchor_9_31" id="FNanchor_9_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_31" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I
had begun the noble art as a boy at Blois, but the poor kestrel upon
which I tried my "'prentice hand" had died soon, worn out like an
Eastern ascetic by the severities of training, especially in the fasting
line. Returning northwards, I found my Corps at Hyderabad, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
passing through the deserted Gharra, joined the Head-quarters of the
Survey at Karáchi in April.</p>

<p>Here I made acquaintance with Mirza Ali Akhbar, who owed his
rank (Khan Bahádur) to his gallant conduct as Sir Charles Napier's
<i>munshi</i> at Miani and Dubba, where he did his best to save as
many unfortunate Beloch braves as possible. He lived outside the
camp in a bungalow which he built for himself, and lodged a friend,
Mirza Dáud, a first-rate Persian scholar. My life became much
mixed up with these gentlemen, and my brother officers fell to
calling me the "White Nigger." I had also invested in a Persian
<i>munshi</i>, Mirza Mohammad Musayn, of Shiraz; poor fellow, after
passing through the fires of Scinde unscathed, he returned to die of
cholera in his native land. With his assistance I opened on the sly
three shops at Karáchi,<a name="FNanchor_10_32" id="FNanchor_10_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_32" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> where cloth, tobacco, and other small
matters were sold exceedingly cheap to those who deserved them,
and where I laid in a stock of native experience, especially regarding
such matters as I have treated upon in my "Terminal Essay" to the
"Thousand Nights and a Night,"<a name="FNanchor_11_33" id="FNanchor_11_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_33" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but I soon lost my <i>munshi</i> friends.
Mirza Dáud died of indigestion and patent pills at Karáchi; I last
saw Mirza Ali Akhbar at Bombay, in 1876, and he deceased shortly
afterwards. He had been unjustly and cruelly treated. Despite the
high praises of Outram and Napier for the honesty and efficiency of
Ali Akhbar,<a name="FNanchor_12_34" id="FNanchor_12_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_34" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the new commission had brought against the doomed
man a number of trumped-up charges, proving bribery and corruption,
and managed to effect his dismissal from the service. The
unfortunate Mirza, in the course of time, disproved them all, but the
only answer to his application for being reinstated was that what
had been done could not now be undone. I greatly regretted his
loss. He had promised me to write out from his Persian notes a
diary of his proceedings during the conquest of Scinde; he was more
"behind the curtain" than any man I knew, and the truths he
might have told would have been exceedingly valuable.</p>

<p>Karáchi was, for India, not a dull place in those days. Besides
our daily work of planning and mapping the surveys of the cold
season, and practising latitudes and longitudes till my right eye
became comparatively short-sighted, we organized a "Survey Mess"
in a bungalow belonging to the office "Compound." There were
six of us&mdash;Blagrave, Maclagan, Vanrenin, and afterwards Price and
Lambert&mdash;and local society pronounced us all mad, although I
cannot see that we were more whimsical than our neighbours. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
also built a bungalow, which got the title of the "Inquisition," and
there I buried my favourite game-cock Bhujang (the dragon), who
had won me many a victory&mdash;people declared that it was the grave
of a small human. I saw much of Mirza Husayn, a brother of Agha
Khan Mahallati, a scion of the Isma'iliyah, or "Old Man of the
Mountain," who, having fled his country, Persia, after a rebellion,
ridiculous even in that land of eternal ridiculous rebellions, turned
<i>condottière</i>, and with his troop of one hundred and thirty ruffians
took service with us and was placed to garrison Jarak (Jerruch).
Here the Belochis came down upon him, and killed or wounded
about a hundred of his troop, after which he passed on to Bombay
and enlightened the Presidency about his having conquered Scinde.
His brother, my acquaintance, also determined to attack Persia <i>viâ</i>
Makran, and managed so well that he found himself travelling to
Teheran, lashed to a gun carriage. The Lodge "Hope" kindly
made me an "entered apprentice," but I had read Carlisle, "The
Atheistical Publisher," and the whole affair appeared to me a
gigantic humbug, dating from the days of the Crusades, and as
Cardinal Newman expressed it, "meaning a goose club." But I
think better of it now, as it still serves political purposes in the
East, and gives us a point against our French rivals and enemies.
As the "Scinde Association" was formed, I was made honorary
secretary, and had no little correspondence with Mr. E. Blyth,
the curator of the Zoological Department, Calcutta. Sir Charles
Napier's friends also determined to start a newspaper, in order to
answer the Enemy in the Gate, and reply to the "base and sordid
Bombay faction," headed by the "Rampant Buist," with a strong
backing of anonymous officials.</p>

<p>The <i>Karrachee Advertiser</i> presently appeared in the modest shape
of a lithographed sheet on Government foolscap, and, through Sir
William Napier, its most spicy articles had the honour of a reprint
in London. Of these, the best were "the letters of Omega," by
my late friend Rathborne, then Collector at Hyderabad, and they
described the vices of the Sind Amirs in language the reverse of
ambiguous. I did not keep copies, nor, unfortunately, did the
clever and genial author.</p>

<p>This pleasant, careless life broke up in November, 1845, when
I started with my friend Scott for a long tour to the north of Sind.
We rode by the high-road through Gharra and Jarak to Kotri, the
station of the Sind flotilla, and then crossed to Hyderabad, where
I found my Corps flourishing. After a very jolly week, we resumed
our way up the right bank of the Indus and on the extreme western
frontier, where we found the Beloch herdsmen in their wildest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
state. About that time began to prevail the wildest reports about
the lost tribes of Israel (who were never lost), and with the aid of
Gesenius and Lynch I dressed up a very pretty grammar and
vocabulary, which proved to sundry scientists that the lost was
found at last. But my mentor would not allow the joke to appear
<i>in print</i>. On Christmas Day we entered "Sehwán," absurdly styled
"Alexander's Camp." Here again the spirit of mischief was too
strong for me. I buried a broken and hocussed jar of "<i>Athenæum</i>
sauce," red pottery with black Etruscan figures, right in the way of
an ardent amateur antiquary; and the results were comical. At
Larkháná we made acquaintance with "fighting FitzGerald," who
commanded there, a magnificent figure, who could cut a donkey
in two; and who, although a man of property, preferred the
hardships of India to the pleasures of home. He had, however,
a mania of blowing himself up in a little steamer mainly of his
own construction, and after his last accident he was invalided
home to England, and died within sight of her shores.
At Larkháná the following letter was received:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Karáchi, January 3, 1846.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Scott</span>,</p>

<p>"The General says you may allow as many of your
assistants as you can spare to join their regiments, if going on
service, with the understanding that they must resign their appointments
and will not be reappointed, etc.</p>

<p>"(Signed) <span class="smcap">John Napier</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>This, beyond bazar reports, was our first notice of the great Sikh
War, which added the Punjab to Anglo-India. This news made me
wild to go. A carpet-soldier was a horror to me, and I was
miserable that anything should take place in India without my
being in the thick of the fight. So, after a visit to Sahkar Shikarpúr
and the neighbourhood, I applied myself with all my might to
prepare for the Campaign. After sundry small surveyings and levellings
about Sahkar (Sukhur), I persuaded Scott, greatly against the
grain, to send in my resignation, and called upon General James
Simpson, who was supposed to be in his dotage, and was qualifying
for the Chief Command in the Crimea.</p>

<p>My application was refused. Happily for me, however, suddenly
appeared an order from Bengal to the purport that all we assistant-surveyors
must give sureties. This was enough for me. I wrote
officially, saying that no man would be bail for me, and was told
to be off to my corps; and on February 23rd, I marched with the
18th from Rohri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Needless to repeat the sad story of our disappointment.<a name="FNanchor_13_35" id="FNanchor_13_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_35" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It was
a model army of thirteen thousand men, Europeans and natives, and
under "Old Charley" it would have walked into Multan as into a
mutton-pie. We had also heard that Náo Mall was wasting his two
millions of gold, and we were willing to save him the trouble.
Merrily we trudged through Sabzalcote and Khanpur, and we
entered Baháwalpur, where we found the heart-chilling order to
retire and to march home, and consequently we marched and returned
to Rohri on April 2nd; and after a few days' halt there,
tired and miserable, we marched south, <i>viâ</i> Khayrpur, and, after
seventeen marches, reached the old regimental quarters in Mohammad
Khan Ká Tándá, on the Fulayli river.<a name="FNanchor_14_36" id="FNanchor_14_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_36" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>But our physical trials and mental disappointments had soured
our tempers, and domestic disturbances began. Our colonel was
one Henry Corsellis, the son of a Bencoolen civilian, and neither
his colour nor his temper were in his favour. The wars began in
a small matter.</p>

<p>I had been making doggrel rhymes on men's names at Mess, and
knowing something of the commanding officer's touchiness, passed
him over. Hereupon he took offence, and seeing well that I was
"in for a row," I said, "Very well, Colonel, I will write your Epitaph,"
which was as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Here lieth the body of Colonel Corsellis;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The rest of the fellow, I fancy, in hell is."</span><br />
</p>

<p>After which we went at it "hammer and tongs."</p>

<p>I shall say no more upon the subject; it is, perhaps, the part of
my life upon which my mind dwells with least satisfaction. In
addition to regimental troubles, there were not a few domestic disagreeables,
especially complications, with a young person named
Núr Jan. To make matters worse, after a dreadful wet night my
mud bungalow came down upon me, wounding my foot.<a name="FNanchor_15_37" id="FNanchor_15_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_37" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The only
pleasant reminiscences of the time are the days spent in the quarters
of an old native friend<a name="FNanchor_16_38" id="FNanchor_16_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_38" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> on the banks of the beautiful Phuleli,
seated upon a felt rug, spread beneath a shadowy tamarind tree,
with beds of sweet-smelling <i>rayhan</i> (basil) around, and eyes looking
over the broad smooth stream and the gaily dressed groups gathered
at the frequent ferries. I need hardly say that these visits were
paid in native costume, and so correct was it, that I, on camel's back,
frequently passed my Commanding Officer in the Gateway of Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Hyderabad, without his recognizing me. I had also a host of good
friends, especially Dr. J. J. Steinhaüser, who, in after years, was to
have accompanied me, but for an accident, to Lake Tanganyika, and
who afterwards became my collaborateur in the "Thousand Nights
and a Night."</p>

<p>The hot season of 1846 was unusually sickly, and the white regiments
at Karáchi, notably the 78th Highlanders, suffered terribly.
Hyderabad was also threatened, but escaped better than she
deserved. In early July I went into "sick quarters," and left my
regiment in early September, with a strong case. At Bombay my
friend Henry J. Carter assisted me, and enabled me to obtain two
years' leave of absence to the Neilgherries.</p>

<p>My <i>munshi</i>, Mohammed Husayn, had sailed for Persia, and I at
once engaged an Arab "coach." This was one Haji Jauhur, a young
Abyssinian, who, with his wife, of the same breed, spoke a curious
Semitic dialect, and was useful in conversational matters. Accompanied
by my servants and horse, I engaged the usual <i>pattymar</i>, the
<i>Daryá Prashád</i> ("Joy of the Ocean"), and set sail for Goa on
February 20th, 1847. In three days' trip we landed in the once
splendid capital, whose ruins I have described in "Goa and the
Blue Mountains" (1851). Dom Pestanha was the Governor-General,
Senhor Gomez Secretary to Government, and Major St.
Maurice chief aide-de-camp, and all treated me with uncommon
kindness. On my third visit to the place in 1876, all my old
friends and acquaintances had disappeared, whilst the other surroundings
had not changed in the least degree.</p>

<p>From Goa to Punány was a trip of five days, and from the little
Malabar Port, a terrible dull ride of ten days, halts and excursions
included, with the only excitement of being nearly drowned in a
torrent, placed me at Conoor, on the western edge of the "Blue
Mountains." At Ootacamund, the capital of the sanitarium, I
found a friend, Lieutenant Dyett, who offered to share with me his
quarters. Poor fellow! he suffered sadly in the Multan campaign,
where most of the wounded came to grief, some said owing to the
salt in the silt, which made so many operations fatal; after three
amputations his arm was taken out of the socket. I have noted the
humours of "Ooty" in the book before mentioned, and I made
myself independent of society by beginning the study of Telugu,
in addition to Arabic.</p>

<p>But the sudden change from dry Scinde to the damp cold mountains
induced in me an attack of rheumatic ophthalmia, which began
at the end of May, 1847, and lasted nearly two years, and would not
be shaken off till I left India in March, 1849. In vain I tried diet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and dark rooms, change of place, blisters of sorts, and the whole
contents of the Pharmacopœia; it was a thorn in the flesh which
determined to make itself felt. At intervals I was able to work hard
and to visit the adjacent places, such as Kotagherry, the Orange
Valley, and St. Catherine's Falls.<a name="FNanchor_17_39" id="FNanchor_17_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_39" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Meanwhile I wrote letters to the
<i>Bombay Times</i>, and studied Telugu and Toda as well as Persian and
Arabic, and worked at the ethnology of Hylobius the Hillman, whose
country showed mysterious remains of civilized life, gold mining
included.</p>

<p>"Ooty" may be a pleasant place, like a water-cure establishment
to an invalid in rude health; but to me nothing could be duller or
more disagreeable, and my two years of sick leave was consequently
reduced to four months. On September 1st, 1847, glad as a
partridge-shooter, I rode down the Ghát, and a dozen days later made
Calicut, the old capital of Camoens' "Jamorim," the Samriry Rajah.
Here I was kindly received, and sent to visit old Calicut and other
sights, by Mr. Collector Conolly, whom a Madras civilianship could
not defend from Fate. A short time after my departure he was set
upon and barbarously murdered in his own verandah, by a band
of villain <i>Moplahs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_40" id="FNanchor_18_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_40" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a bastard race got by Arab sires on Hindú
dams. He was thus the third of the gallant brothers who came to
violent end.</p>

<p>This visit gave me a good opportunity of studying on the spot
the most remarkable scene of "The Lusiads," and it afterwards
served me in good stead. The <i>Seaforth</i>, Captain Biggs, carried
me to Bombay, after passing visits to Mangalore and Goa, in three
days of ugly monsoon weather. On October 15th I passed in Persian
at the Town Hall, coming out first of some thirty, with a compliment
from the examiners; and this was succeeded by something more
substantial, in the shape of an "honorarium" of Rs. 1000 from the
Court of Directors.</p>

<p>This bright side of the medal had its reverse. A friend, an Irish
medico, volunteered to prescribe for me, and strongly recommended
frictions of citric ointment (calomel in disguise) round the orbit
of the eye, and my perseverance in his prescription developed
ugly symptoms of mercurialism, which eventually drove me from
India.</p>

<p>My return to Scinde was in the s.s. <i>Dwárká</i>, the little vessel which,
in 1853, carried me from Jeddah to Suez, and which, in 1862,
foundered at the mouth of the Tapti or Surat river. She belonged
to the Steam Navigation Company, Bombay, and she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
brought safely round the Cape by the skipper, a man named Tribe.
That "climate" had demoralized him. He set out from Karáchi
without even an able seaman who knew the Coast; the Captain and
his Mate were drunk and incapable the whole way. As we were
about to enter the dangerous port, my fellow-passengers insisted upon
my taking Command as Senior Officer, and I ordered the <i>Dwárká's</i>
head to be turned westward under the easiest steam, so that next
morning we landed safely.</p>

<p>My return to head-quarters of the Survey was a misfortune to my
comrades; my eyes forbade regular work, and my friends had to
bear my share of the burden. However, there were painless intervals
when I found myself able to work at Sindí under Munshi Nandú,
and at Arabic under Shaykh Háshim, a small half-Bedawin, who had
been imported by me from Bombay. Under him also I began the
systematic study of practical Moslem divinity, learned about a
quarter of the Korán by heart, and became a proficient at prayer.
It was always my desire to visit Meccah during the pilgrimage
season; written descriptions by hearsay of its rites and ceremonies
were common enough in all languages, European as well as native,
but none satisfied me, because none seemed practically to know
anything about the matter. So to this preparation I devoted all my
time and energy; not forgetting a sympathetic study of Sufi-ism, the
<i>Gnosticism</i> of Al-Islam,<a name="FNanchor_19_41" id="FNanchor_19_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_41" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which would raise me high above the rank
of a mere Moslem. I conscientiously went through the <i>chillá</i>, or
quarantine of fasting and other exercises, which, by-the-by, proved
rather over-exciting to the brain. At times, when overstrung, I
relieved my nerves with a course of Sikh religion and literature:
the good old priest solemnly initiated me in presence of the swinging
<i>Granth</i>, or Naná Shah's Scripture. As I had already been duly
invested by a strict Hindú with the <i>Janeo</i>, or "Brahminical thread,"
my experience of Eastern faiths became phenomenal, and I became
a Master-Sufi.</p>

<p>There was a scanty hope of surveying for weak eyes; so I
attempted to do my duty by long reports concerning the country
and the people, addressed to the Bombay Government, and these
were duly printed in its "Selections," which MSS. I have by me.
To the local branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, there were sent
two papers, "Grammar of the Játakí or Mulltani Language," and
"Remarks on Dr. Dorn's Chrestomathy of the Afghan Tongue."<a name="FNanchor_20_42" id="FNanchor_20_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_42" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Without hearing of Professor Pott, the <i>savant</i> of Halle (and deceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
lately), I convinced myself that the Játs of Scinde, a race which
extends from the Indus's mouth to the plains of Tartary, give a
clue to the origin of the Gypsies as well as to the Getæ and
Massagetæ (Great Getæ).</p>

<p>And this induced me to work with the Camel men, who belong to
that notorious race, and to bring out a grammar and vocabulary.</p>

<p>Indeed the more sluggish became my sight, the more active became
my brain, which could be satisfied only with twelve to fourteen hours
a day of alchemy, mnemonics, "Mantih," or Eastern logic, Arabic,
Sindi, and Panjábi. In the latter, official examinations were passed
before Captain Stack, the only Englishman in the country who had
an inkling of the subject.</p>

<p>The spring of 1848, that most eventful year in Europe, brought
us two most exciting items of intelligence. The proclamation of the
French Republic reached us on April 8th, and on May 2nd came
the news of the murder of Anderson and his companion by Náo Mall
of Multan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Little_Autobiography"></a>His Little Autobiography.</i></div>

<p>Richard wrote a little bit of autobiography about himself in 1852.
In case all may not have seen it, and many may not remember it, I
here insert it.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Richard Burton's Little Autobiography.</span></h4>


<p>"The only scrap of autobiography we have from Richard Burton's
pen," said Alfred Richard Bates, "was written very early in life, whilst
in India, and dates thirty years ago. It is so characteristic it deserves
to be perpetuated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I extract the following few lines from a well-known literary journal
as a kind of excuse for venturing, unasked, upon a scrap of autobiography.
As long as critics content themselves with bedevilling
one's style, discovering that one's slang is 'vulgar,' and one's attempts
at drollery 'failures,' one should, methinks, listen silently to their
ideas of 'gentility,' and accept their definitions of wit, reserving
one's own opinion upon such subjects. For the British author in
this, our modern day, engages himself as clown in a great pantomime,
to be knocked down, and pulled up, slashed, tickled, and buttered
<i>à discrétion</i> for the benefit of a manual-pleasantry-loving Public. So
it would be weakness in him to complain of bruised back, scored
elbows, and bumped head.</p>

<p>"Besides, the treatment you receive varies prodigiously according
to the temper and the manifold influences from without that operate
upon the gentleman that operates upon you. For instance&mdash;</p>

<p>"''Tis a <i>failure</i> at being <i>funny</i>,' says surly Aristarchus, when, for
some reason or other, he dislikes you or your publisher.</p>

<p>"'It is a <i>smart</i> book,' opines another, who has no particular reason
to be your friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Narrated with <i>freshness of thought</i>,' declares a third, who takes
an honest pride in 'giving the devil his due.'</p>

<p>"'Very <i>clever</i>,' exclaims the amiable critic, who for some reason
or another likes you or your publisher.</p>

<p>"'There is <i>wit</i> and <i>humour</i> in these pages,' says the gentleman
who has some particular reason to be your friend.</p>

<p>"'Evinces considerable <i>talent</i>.'</p>

<p>"And&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There is <i>genius</i> in this book,' declare the dear critics who in any
way identify themselves or their interests with you.</p>

<p>"Now for the extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Mr. Burton was, it appears, stationed for several years in Sind
with his regiment, and it is due to him to say that he has set a good
example to his fellow-subalterns by pursuing so diligently his inquiries
into the language, literature, and customs of the native population
by which he was surrounded. We are far from accepting all
his doctrines on questions of Eastern policy, especially as regards
the treatment of natives; but we are sensible of the value of the
additional evidence which he has brought forward on many important
questions. For a young man, he seems to have adopted some
very extreme opinions; and it is perhaps not too much to say, that
the fault from which he has most to fear, not only as an author, but
as an Indian officer, is a disregard of those well-established rules of
moderation which no one can transgress with impunity.'</p>

<p>"The greatest difficulty a raw writer on Indian subjects has to
contend with, is a proper comprehension of the <i>ignorance crasse</i> which
besets the mind of the home-reader and his oracle the critic. What
a knowledge these lines <i>do</i> show of the opportunity for study presented
to the Anglo-Indian subaltern serving with his corps! Part
of the time when I did duty with mine we were quartered at Ghárrá,
a heap of bungalows surrounded by a wall of milk-bush; on a sandy
flat, near a dirty village whose timorous inhabitants shunned us as
walking pestilences. No amount of domiciliary visiting would have
found a single Sindian book in the place, except the accounts of the
native shopkeepers; and, to the best of my remembrance, there
was not a soul who could make himself intelligible in the common
medium of Indian intercourse&mdash;Hindostani. An ensign stationed at
Dover Castle might write 'Ellis's Antiquities;' a <i>sous-lieutenant</i> with
his corps at Boulogne might compose the 'Legendaire de la Morinie,'
but Ghárrá was sufficient to paralyse the readiest pen that ever
coursed over foolscap paper.</p>

<p>"Now, waiving, with all due modesty, the unmerited compliment
of 'good boy,' so gracefully tendered to me, I proceed to the judgment
which follows it, my imminent peril of 'extreme opinions.' If
there be any value in the 'additional evidence' I have 'brought
forward on important questions,' the reader may, perchance, be
curious to know how that evidence was collected. So, without
further apology, I plunge into the subject.</p>

<p>"After some years of careful training for the Church in the north
and south of France, Florence, Naples, and the University of Pisa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
I found myself one day walking the High Street, Oxford, with all
the emotions which a Parisian exquisite of the first water would
experience on awaking&mdash;at 3 p.m.&mdash;in 'Dandakaran's tangled
wood.'</p>

<p>"To be brief, my 'college career' was highly unsatisfactory. I
began a 'reading man,' worked regularly twelve hours a day, failed
in everything&mdash;chiefly, I flattered myself, because Latin hexameters
and Greek iambics had not entered into the list of my studies&mdash;threw
up the classics, and returned to old habits of fencing, boxing,
and single-stick, handling the 'ribbons,' and sketching facetiously,
though not wisely, the reverend features and figures of certain half-reformed
monks, calling themselves 'fellows.' My reading also ran
into bad courses&mdash;Erpenius, Zadkiel, Falconry, Cornelius Agrippa,
and the Art of Pluck.</p>

<p>"At last the Afghan War broke out. After begging the paternal
authority in vain for the Austrian service, the Swiss Guards at Naples,
and even the <i>Légion étrangère</i>, I determined to leave Oxford, <i>coûte
qui coûte</i>. The testy old lady, Alma Mater, was easily persuaded to
consign, for a time, to 'country nursing' the froward brat who
showed not a whit of filial regard for her. So, after two years, I
left Trinity, without a 'little go,' in a high dog-cart,&mdash;a companion
in misfortune too-tooing lustily through a 'yard of tin,' as the dons
started up from their game of bowls to witness the departure of the
forbidden vehicle. Thus having thoroughly established the fact that
I was fit for nothing but to be 'shot at for sixpence a day,' and as
those Afghans (how I blessed their name!) had cut gaps in many a
regiment, my father provided me with a commission in the Indian
army, and started me as quickly as feasible for the 'Land of
the Sun.'</p>

<p>"So, my friends and fellow-soldiers, I may address you in the
words of the witty thief&mdash;slightly altered from Gil Blas&mdash;'Blessings
on the dainty pow of the old dame who turned me out of her house;
for had she shown clemency I should now doubtless be a dyspeptic
Don, instead of which I have the honour to be a lieutenant, your
comrade.'</p>

<p>"As the Bombay pilot sprang on board, twenty mouths agape
over the gangway, all asked one and the same question. Alas! the
answer was a sad one!&mdash;the Afghans had been defeated&mdash;the
avenging army had retreated! The twenty mouths all ejaculated a
something unfit for ears polite.</p>

<p>"To a mind thoroughly impressed with the sentiment that</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Man wants but little here below,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor wants that little long,'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>the position of an Ensign in the Hon. E. I. Company's Service is a
very satisfactory one. He has a horse or two, part of a house, a
pleasant Mess, plenty of pale ale, as much shooting as he can
manage, and an occasional invitation to a dance, where there are
thirty-two cavaliers to three dames, or to a dinner-party when a chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
unexpectedly falls vacant. But some are vain enough to want more,
and of these fools was I.</p>

<p>"In India two roads lead to preferment. The direct highway is
'service;'&mdash;getting a flesh wound, cutting down a few of the enemy,
and doing something eccentric, so that your name may creep into
a despatch. The other path, study of the languages, is a rugged
and tortuous one, still you have only to plod steadily along its
length, and, sooner or later, you must come to a 'staff appointment.'
<i>Bien entendu</i>, I suppose you to be destitute of or deficient in
Interest whose magic influence sets you down at once a heaven-born
Staff Officer, at the goal which others must toil to reach.</p>

<p>"A dozen lessons from Professor Forbes and a native servant on
board the <i>John Knox</i> enabled me to land with <i>éclat</i> as a griff, and
to astonish the throng of palanquin bearers that jostled, pushed, and
pulled me at the pier head, with the vivacity and nervousness of my
phraseology. And I spent the first evening in company with one
Dosabhai Sohrabji, a white-bearded Parsee, who, in his quality of
language-master, had vernacularized the tongues of Hormuzd knows
how many generations of Anglo-Indian subalterns.</p>

<p>"The corps to which I was appointed was then in country quarters
at Baroda, in the land of Gujerat; the journey was a long one, the
difficulty of finding good instructors there was great, so was the
expense, moreover fevers abounded; and, lastly, it was not so easy
to obtain leave of absence to visit the Presidency, where candidates
for the honours of language are examined. These were serious
obstacles to success; they were surmounted, however, in six months,
at the end of which time I found myself in the novel position of
'passed interpreter in Hindostani.'</p>

<p>"My success&mdash;for I had distanced a field of eleven&mdash;encouraged
me to a second attempt, and though I had to front all the difficulties
over again, in four months my name appeared in orders as qualified
to interpret in the Guzerattee tongue.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the Ameers of Sind had exchanged their palaces at
Haydarábád for other quarters not quite so comfortable at Hazareebagh,
and we were ordered up to the Indus for the pleasant purpose
of acting police there. Knowing the Conqueror's chief want, a man
who could speak a word of his pet conquest's vernacular dialect, I
had not been a week at Karáchee before I found a language-master
and a book. But the study was undertaken <i>invitâ minervâ</i>. We
were quartered in tents, dust-storms howled over us daily, drills and
brigade parades were never ending, and, as I was acting interpreter
to my regiment, courts-martial of dreary length occupied the best
part of my time. Besides, it was impossible to work in such an
atmosphere of discontent. The seniors abhorred the barren desolate
spot, with all its inglorious perils of fever, spleen, dysentery, and
congestion of the brain, the juniors grumbled in sympathy, and the
Staff officers, ordered up to rejoin the corps&mdash;it was on field service&mdash;complained
bitterly of having to quit their comfortable appointments
in more favoured lands without even a campaign in prospect.
So when, a month or two after landing in the country, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
transferred from Karáchee to Ghárrá&mdash;purgatory to the other locale&mdash;I
threw aside Sindí for Maharattee, hoping, by dint of reiterated
examinations, to escape the place of torment as soon as possible.
It was very like studying Russian in an English country-town; however,
with the assistance of Molesworth's excellent dictionary, and the
regimental <i>pundit</i>, or schoolmaster, I gained some knowledge of the
dialect, and proved myself duly qualified in it at Bombay. At the same
time a brother subaltern and I had jointly leased a Persian <i>moonshee</i>,
one Mirza Mohammed Hosayn, of Shiraz. Poor fellow, after
passing through the fires of Sind unscathed, he returned to his delightful
land for a few weeks, to die there!&mdash;and we laid the foundation
of a lengthened course of reading in that most elegant of Oriental
languages.</p>

<p>"Now it is a known fact that a good Staff appointment has the
general effect of doing away with one's bad opinion of any place
whatever. So when, by the kindness of a friend whose name <i>his</i>
modesty prevents my mentioning, the Governor of Sind was persuaded
to give me the temporary appointment of Assistant in the Survey,
I began to look with interest upon the desolation around me. The
country was a new one, so was its population, so was their language.
After reading all the works published upon the subject, I felt
convinced that none but Mr. Crow and Captain J. MacMurdo had
dipped beneath the superficies of things. My new duties compelled
me to spend the cold season in wandering over the districts,
levelling the beds of canals, and making preparatory sketches for
a grand survey. I was thrown so entirely amongst the people as to
depend upon them for society, and the 'dignity,' not to mention
the increased allowances of a Staff officer, enabled me to collect a
fair stock of books, and to gather around me those who could make
them of any use. So, after the first year, when I had Persian at
my fingers'-ends, sufficient Arabic to read, write, and converse
fluently, and a superficial knowledge of that dialect of Punjaubee
which is spoken in the wilder parts of the province, I began the
systematic study of the Sindian people, their mariners and their
tongue.</p>

<p>"The first difficulty was to pass for an Oriental, and this was as
necessary as it was difficult. The European official in India seldom,
if ever, sees anything in its real light, so dense is the veil which the
fearfulness, the duplicity, the prejudice, and the superstitions of
the natives hang before his eyes. And the white man lives a life
so distinct from the black, that hundreds of the former serve through
what they call their 'term of exile' without once being present at
a circumcision feast, a wedding, or a funeral. More especially the
present generation, whom the habit and the means of taking
furloughs, the increased facility for enjoying ladies' society, and, if
truth be spoken, a greater regard for appearances, if not a stricter
code of morality, estrange from their dusky fellow-subjects every day
more and more. After trying several characters, the easiest to be
assumed was, I found, that of a half-Arab, half-Iranian, such as may
be met with in thousands along the northern shore of the Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Gulf. The Sindians would have detected in a moment the difference
between my articulation and their own, had I attempted to speak
their vernacular dialect, but they attributed the accent to my strange
country, as naturally as a home-bred Englishman would account for
the bad pronunciation of a foreigner calling himself partly Spanish,
partly Portuguese. Besides, I knew the countries along the Gulf by
heart from books, I had a fair knowledge of the Shiah form of
worship prevalent in Persia, and my poor <i>moonshee</i> was generally
at hand to support me in times of difficulty, so that the danger of
being detected&mdash;even by a 'real Simon Pure'&mdash;was a very inconsiderable
one.</p>

<p>"With hair falling upon his shoulders, a long beard, face and
hands, arms and feet, stained with a thin coat of henna, Mirza
Abdullah of Bushire&mdash;your humble servant&mdash;set out upon many and
many a trip. He was a <i>bazzaz</i>, a vendor of fine linen, calicoes, and
muslins&mdash;such chapmen are sometimes admitted to display their
wares, even in the sacred harem, by 'fast' and fashionable dames&mdash;and
he had a little pack of <i>bijouterie</i> and <i>virtù</i> reserved for
emergencies. It was only, however, when absolutely necessary that
he displayed his stock-in-trade; generally, he contented himself with
alluding to it on all possible occasions, boasting largely of his
traffic, and asking a thousand questions concerning the state of the
market. Thus he could walk into most men's houses, quite without
ceremony; even if the master dreamed of kicking him out, the
mistress was sure to oppose such measure with might and main.
He secured numberless invitations, was proposed to by several
papas, and won, or had to think he won, a few hearts; for he came
as a rich man and he stayed with dignity, and he departed exacting
all the honours. When wending his ways he usually urged a return
of visit in the morning, but he was seldom to be found at the
caravanserai he specified&mdash;was Mirza Abdullah the Bushiri.</p>

<p>"The timid villagers collected in crowds to see the rich merchant
in Oriental dress, riding spear in hand, and pistols in holsters,
towards the little encampment pitched near their settlements. But
regularly every evening on the line of march the Mirza issued from
his tent and wandered amongst them, collecting much information
and dealing out more concerning an ideal master&mdash;the Feringhee
supposed to be sitting in State amongst the <i>moonshees</i>, the Scribes,
the servants, the wheels, the chains, the telescopes, and the other
magical implements in which the camp abounded. When travelling,
the Mirza became this mysterious person's factotum, and often had
he to answer the question how much his perquisites and illicit gains
amounted to in the course of the year.</p>

<p>"When the Mirza arrived at a strange town, his first step was to
secure a house in or near the bazar, for the purpose of evening
<i>conversazioni</i>. Now and then he rented a shop, and furnished it
with clammy dates, viscid molasses, tobacco, ginger, rancid oil, and
strong-smelling sweetmeats; and wonderful tales Fame told about
these establishments. Yet somehow or other, though they were
more crowded than a first-rate milliner's rooms in town, they throve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
not in a pecuniary point of view; the cause of which was, I believe,
that the polite Mirza was in the habit of giving the heaviest possible
weight for their money to all the ladies, particularly the pretty ones,
that honoured him by patronizing his concern.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the Mirza passed the evening in a mosque listening
to the ragged students who, stretched at full length with their
stomachs on the dusty floor, and their arms supporting their heads,
mumbled out Arabic from the thumbed, soiled, and tattered pages
of theology upon which a dim oil light shed its scanty ray, or he sat
debating the niceties of faith with the long-bearded, shaven-pated,
blear-eyed, and stolid-faced <i>genus loci</i>, the <i>Mullah</i>. At other times,
when in merrier mood, he entered uninvited the first door whence
issued the sounds of music and the dance;&mdash;a clean turban and
a polite bow are the best 'tickets for soup' the East knows. Or he
played chess with some native friend, or he consorted with the hemp-drinkers
and opium-eaters in the <i>estaminets</i>, or he visited the Mrs.
Gadabouts and Go-betweens who make matches amongst the Faithful,
and gathered from them a precious budget of private history
and domestic scandal.</p>

<p>"What scenes he saw! what adventures he went through! But
who would believe, even if he ventured to detail them?<a name="FNanchor_21_43" id="FNanchor_21_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_43" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>"The Mirza's favourite school for study was the house of an elderly
matron on the banks of the Fulailee River, about a mile from the
Fort of Haydarábád. Khanum Jan had been a beauty in her youth,
and the tender passion had been hard upon her&mdash;at least judging
from the fact that she had fled her home, her husband, and her native
town, Candahar, in company with Mohammed Bakhsh, a purblind
old tailor, the object of her warmest affections.</p>

<p>"'Ah, he is a regular old hyæna now,' would the Joan exclaim
in her outlandish Persian, pointing to the venerable Darby as he sat
in the cool shade, nodding his head and winking his eyes over a
pair of pantaloons which took him a month to sew, 'but you should
have seen him fifteen years ago, what a wonderful youth he was!'</p>

<p>"The knowledge of one mind is that of a million&mdash;after a fashion.
I addressed myself particularly to that of 'Darby;' and many an
hour of tough thought it took me before I had mastered its truly
Oriental peculiarities, its regular irregularities of deduction, and its
strange monotonous one-idea'dness.</p>

<p>"Khanum Jan's house was a mud edifice, occupying one side of
a square formed by tall, thin, crumbling mud walls. The respectable
matron's peculiar vanity was to lend a helping hand in all manner
of <i>affaires du cœur</i>. So it often happened that Mirza Abdullah was
turned out of the house to pass a few hours in the garden. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
he sat upon his felt rug spread beneath a shadowy tamarind, with
beds of sweet-smelling basil around him, his eyes roving over the
broad river that coursed rapidly between its wooded banks and the
groups gathered at the frequent ferries, whilst the soft strains of
mysterious, philosophical, transcendental Hafiz were sounded in his
ears by the other Mirza, his companion; Mohammed Hosayn&mdash;peace
be upon him!</p>

<p>"Of all economical studies this course was the cheapest. For
tobacco daily, for frequent draughts of milk, for hemp occasionally,
for four months' lectures from Mohammed Bakhsh, and for sundry
other little indulgences, the Mirza paid, it is calculated, the sum of
six shillings. When he left Haydarábád, he gave a silver talisman
to the dame, and a cloth coat to her protector: long may they live
to wear them!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Thus it was I formed my estimate of the native character. I
am as ready to reform it when a man of more extensive experience
and greater knowledge of the subject will kindly show me how far it
transgresses the well-established limits of moderation. As yet I
hold, by way of general rule, that the Eastern mind&mdash;I talk of the
nations known to me by personal experience&mdash;is always in extremes;
that it ignores what is meant by 'golden mean,' and that it delights
to range in flights limited only by the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of Nature herself.
Under which conviction I am open to correction.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Richard F. Burton.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Books_on_India"></a>His Books on India.</i></div>

<p>Richard's works on India are&mdash;A grammar of the Játakí, or
Belochi dialect. Here I would remark he mixed with the Játs of
Sind, a race extending from the mouth of the Indus to the plains of
Tartary, and who <i>he</i> believed to be the origin and head of the
numerous tribes of Oriental gypsies, and he worked with the Camel
men to assimilate himself with them. The next work was a grammar
of the Mooltanee language, "Notes on the Pushtû, or Afghan
Dialect," Reports to Bombay, (1) "General Notes on Sind," (2)
"Notes on the Population of Sind."</p>

<p>These were all <i>preparatory</i> to becoming an author, and were
brought out in 1849 by the Royal Asiatic Society, Bombay branch,
and the Government Records. I have a single copy of each, but
they must be out of print; meantime he prepared "Goa and the Blue
Mountains," 1 vol.; "Scinde, or the Unhappy Valley," 2 vols.; and
"Sindh and the Races that inhabit the Valley of the Indus," 1 vol.;
but these did not appear until 1851.</p>

<p>"Scinde, or the Unhappy Valley," is, I think, the freshest, most
witty and spirited thing I ever read. He had not been to war with
the critics and Mrs. Grundy then, and there is all the boy's fun and
fire in it. "Falconry in the Valley of the Indus" was produced in
1852, and is worthy of any sportsman's attention. That is Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Voorst's, now Gurney and Jackson, whom Richard used to say was
the only honest publisher he ever met. It is <i>not</i> out of print. In
1870 appeared "Vikram and the Vampire," 1 vol. These tales are
thoroughly witty, and make those laugh heartily who have lived in
the East, but it was a great amusement to Richard and me, when
the publisher, having accepted "Vikram," which is full of "chaff,"
said to me with a long face, "My eldest boy and I read over some
of the tales last night, and we were so disappointed we could not
laugh." I could not help saying drily, "No, I dare say you couldn't."</p>

<p>The last book on India was "Sind Revisited," 2 vols., 1877. It
was written in maturer years and after hard experience of the world.
It may be more valuable, but to my mind has not the sparkle of
twenty-six years earlier. All these eight or ten books, including my
own "A.E.I."&mdash;"Arabia, Egypt, and India"&mdash;brought out in 1879,
I boiled down into Christmas books for boys. I took my manuscript
(enough for three Christmas books) to David Bogue, King William
Street, Strand, and went abroad, and the next thing I heard was, that
David Bogue was bankrupt, and my manuscript had disappeared.</p>

<p>I give a few pages in the appendixes out of his first book on
Scinde as a sample. One describes his visit to the village of a
Scindian chief, a perfect picture of an Oriental visit; the other is a
description of a cock-fight. After his transfer to the Goanese Church,
his bungalow was nicknamed the "Inquisition," and there he buried
Bhujang, when his favourite game-cock departed this life, and people
declared it was a baby's grave. For all that my husband <i>said</i> of
India, he talked exactly as Mr. Rudyard Kipling writes, and when I
read him, I can hear Richard talking; hence I knew how true and
to the point are his writings. Also I think Mr. Kipling must have
taken his character of "Strickland" from my husband, who mixed
with, and knew all about, the natives and their customs, as Strickland
did.</p>

<p>During those first seven years in India, Richard passed in Hindostani,
Guzaratee, Persian, Maharattee, Sindhee, Punjaubee, Arabic,
Telugu, Pushtû (Afghan tongue), with Turkish and Armenian. In
1844 he went to Scinde with the 18th Native Infantry, and Colonel
Walter Scott put him on Sir Charles Napier's staff, who soon found out
what he was worth, and turned his merits to account, but he accompanied
his regiment to Mooltan to attack the Sikhs. He became
much attached to his Chief; they quite understood each other, and
remained together for five years. Richard's training was of the
uncommon sort, and glorious as it was, dangerous as it was, and
romantic as it will ever be to posterity, he did not get from dense
and narrow-minded Governments those rewards which men who risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
their lives deserve, and which would have been given to the man
who took care of "number one," and who, with average stupidity,
worked on red-tape lines. He was sent out amongst the wild tribes
of the hills and plains to collect information for Sir Charles. He
did not go as a British officer or Commissioner, because he knew
he would see nothing but what the natives chose him to see; he
let down a curtain between himself and Civilization, and a tattered,
dirty-looking dervish would wander on foot, lodge in mosques,
where he was venerated as a saintly man, mix with the strangest
company, join the Beloch and the Brahui tribes (Indo-Scythians),
about whom there was nothing then known. Sometimes he appeared
in the towns; as a merchant he opened a shop, sold stuffs
or sweetmeats in the bazar. Sometimes he worked with the men
in native dress, "Játs" and Camel men, at levelling canals.</p>

<p>When Richard was in India he at one time got rather tired of the
daily Mess, and living with men, and he thought he should like to
learn the manners, customs, and habits of monkeys, so he collected
forty monkeys of all kinds of ages, races, species, and he lived with
them, and he used to call them by different offices. He had his
doctor, his chaplain, his secretary, his aide-de-camp, his agent, and
one tiny one, a very pretty, small, silky-looking monkey, he used to call
his wife, and put pearls in her ears. His great amusement was to
keep a kind of refectory for them, where they all sat down on chairs
at meals, and the servants waited on them, and each had its bowl
and plate, with the food and drinks proper for them. He sat at the
head of the table, and the pretty little monkey sat by him in a high
baby's chair, with a little bar before it. He had a little whip on the
table, with which he used to keep them in order when they had bad
manners, which did sometimes occur, as they frequently used to get
jealous of the little monkey, and try to claw her. He did this for
the sake of doing what Mr. Garner is now doing, that of ascertaining
and studying the language of monkeys, so that he used regularly to
talk to them, and pronounce their sounds afterwards, till he and the
monkeys at last got quite to understand each other. He obtained
as many as sixty words, I think twenty more than Mr. Garner&mdash;that
is, leading words&mdash;and he wrote them down and formed a vocabulary,
meaning to pursue his studies at some future time. Mr. Garner
has now the advantage of phonographs, and all sorts of appliances.
Had Richard been alive, he could have helped him greatly. Unfortunately
his monkey vocabulary was burnt in Grindlay's fire. He
also writes&mdash;but this was with his regiment&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Burying_a_Sanyasi"></a>Burying a Sányasi.</i></div>

<p>"Amongst other remarkable experiments made by me, a Sányasi,
whom I knew, talked to me about their manner of burying themselves
alive. I said I would not believe it unless I saw it. The native therefore
told me that he would prove it, by letting me try it; but that he
should require three days for preparation, and hoped for a reward.
Accordingly for three days he made his preparations by swallowing
immense draughts of milk. I refused to put him in a coffin, or
to bury him in the earth, lest he should die; but he lay down
in a hammock, rolled his tongue up in his throat, and appeared
to be dead. My brother officers and I then slung him up to the
ceiling by four large hooks and ropes, lying comfortably in the
hammock, and, to avoid trickery, one of us was always on guard
day and night, each taking two hours' watch at a time. After
three weeks we began to get frightened, because if the man died
there would be such a scandal. So we lowered him down, and tried
to awake him. We opened his mouth and tried to unroll his tongue
into its natural position. He then, after some time, woke perfectly
well. We gave him food, paid him a handsome reward, and he
went away quite delighted, offering to do it for <i>three months</i>, if it
pleased us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard would be in a dozen different capacities on his travels,
but when he returned, he was rich with news and information for Sir
Charles, for he arrived at secrets quite out of the reach of the British
Army. He knew all that the natives knew, which was more than
British officers and surveyors did. General MacMurdo consulted
his journals and Survey books, which were highly praised by the
Surveyor-General. He was frequently in the presence of and
speaking before his own Colonel without his having the slightest
idea that it was Richard.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Napier liked decision; he hated a man who had not
an answer ready for him. For instance, a young man would go and
ask him for an appointment. Sir Charles would say, "What do you
want?" The youth of firm mind would answer, "An Adjutancy, Sir."
"All right," said Sir Charles, and he probably got it. But "Anything
you please, Sir Charles," would be sure to be contemptuously
dismissed. On returning from his native researches, Sir Charles
would ask Richard such questions as: "Is it true that native
high-class landowners, who monopolize the fiefs about the heads
of the canals, neglect to clear out the tails, and allow Government
ground and the peasants' fields to lie barren for want of
water?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly true, Sir."</p>

<p>"What would be my best course then?"</p>

<p>"Simply to confiscate the whole or part of those estates,
Sir."</p>

<p>"H'm! You don't mince matters, Burton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>He once asked Richard how many bricks there were in a newly
built bridge (an impossible question, such as are put to lads whom the
examiner intends to pluck). Richard, knowing his foible, answered,
"229,010, Sir Charles." He turned away and smiled. Another
time he ordered a review on a grand scale to impress certain
Chiefs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Burton, be pleased to inform these gentlemen that I
propose to form these men in line, then to break into échelon by
the right, and to form square on the centre battalion," and so on,
for about five minutes in military technical terms, for which there
were no equivalents in these men's dialects.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said Richard, saluting.</p>

<p>Turning to the Chiefs, Richard said, "Oh, Chiefs! our Great Man
is going to show you the way we fight, and you must be attentive to
the rules." He then touched his cap to Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"Have you explained all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Everything, Sir," answered Richard.</p>

<p>"A most concentrated language that must be," said Sir Charles,
riding off with his nose in the air.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Indian_Career_practically_ends"></a>His Indian Career practically ends.</i></div>

<p>After seven years of this kind of life, overwork, overstudy, combined
with the hot season, and the march up the Indus Valley, told on
Richard's health, and at the end of the campaign he was attacked
by severe ophthalmia, the result of mental and physical fatigue, and
he was ordered to take a short rest. He utilized that leave in going
to Goa, and especially to Old Goa, where, as he said himself, he
made a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Francis Xavier, and explored
the scenes of the Inquisition. At last news reached him that another
campaign was imminent in Mooltan, that Sir Charles Napier would
take command; Colonel Scott and a host of friends were ordered
up. He writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I applied in almost suppliant terms to accompany the force as
interpreter. I had passed examinations in six native languages, besides
studying others, Multani included, and yet General Auchmuty's
secretary wrote to me that this could not be, as he had chosen
for the post Lieutenant X. Y. Z., who had passed in Hindustani.</p>

<p>"This last misfortune broke my heart. I had been seven
years in India, working like a horse, volunteering for every bit of
service, and qualifying myself for all contingencies. Rheumatic
ophthalmia, which had almost left me when in hopes of marching
northward, came on with redoubled force, and no longer had I any
hope of curing it except by a change to Europe. Sick, sorry, and
almost in tears of rage, I bade adieu to my friends and comrades in
Sind. At Bombay there was no difficulty in passing the Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Board, and I embarked at Bombay for a passage round the Cape,
as the Austral winter was approaching, in a sixty-year-old teak-built
craft, the brig <i>Eliza</i>, Captain Cory.</p>

<p>"My career in India had been in my eyes a failure, and by no
fault of my own; the dwarfish demon called 'Interest' had fought
against me, and as usual had won the fight."</p></blockquote>

<p><br />When Richard came home, he first ran down full of joy to visit all
his relations and friends. He then went to Oxford with half a mind
to take his degree. He was between twenty-eight and twenty-nine
years of age. In 1850 he went back to France, and devoted himself
to fencing. To this day "the Burton <i>une-deux</i>" and notably the
<i>manchette</i> (the upward slash, disabling the swordarm, and saving
life in affairs of honour), earned him his <i>brevet de pointe</i> for the
excellence of his swordsmanship, and he became a <i>Maître d'armes</i>.
Indeed, as horseman, swordsman, and marksman, no soldier of his
day surpassed him, and very few equalled him. His family, that
is his father, mother and sister, with her two children&mdash;her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
being in India, and his brother Edward in the 37th Regiment
(Queen's)&mdash;went to Boulogne, like all the rest of us, for change, quiet,
and economy, and there he joined them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Boulogne"></a>Boulogne.</i></div>

<p><i>We</i> did exactly the same, the object being to put me and my
sisters into the Sacré Cœur to learn French. Boulogne, in those
days, was a very different town to what it is now. It was "the
home of the stranger who had done something wrong." The natives
were of the usual merchant, or rich <i>bourgeoisie</i> class; there was a
sprinkling of local <i>noblesse</i> in the Haute-Ville; the gem of the
natives in the lower class were the Poissardes, who hold themselves
entirely distinct from the town, are a cross between Spanish and
Flemish, and in <i>those</i> days were headed by a handsome "Queen"
called Caroline, long since dead. The English colony was very
large. The <i>créme</i>, who did not mix with the general "smart
people," were the Seymours, Dundases, Chichesters, Jerninghams,
Bedingfelds, Cliffords, Molyneux-Seels, and ourselves. Maybe I
have forgotten many others.</p>

<p>The rest of the colony, instead of living like the colonies that
Richard describes at Tours, used to walk a great deal up and down
the Grand Rue, which was the fashionable lounge, the Rue de
l'Écu, the Quai, and the Pier. The men were handsome and smart,
and beautifully dressed, with generally an immense amount of white
shirt-front, as in the Park, and the girls were pretty and well
dressed. So were the young married women in those days. The
Établissement was a sort of Casino, where everybody passed their
evening, except the <i>créme;</i> they had music, dancing, cards, old
ladies knitting, and refreshments, and it was the hotbed, like a club,
of all the gossip and flirtation, with an occasional roaring scandal.</p>

<p>The hardship of <i>my</i> life and that of my sisters, was, that our
mother would never let us set foot inside of it, which was naturally
the only thing we longed to do, so that we had awfully dull, slow
lives. Here Richard brought out his "Goa," his two books on Scinde,
and his "Falconry," and prepared a book that came out in 1853,
"A Complete System of Bayonet Exercise," of which, I regret to
say, the only copy I possessed has been lost with the manuscript
at David Bogue's. People were <i>now</i> beginning to say that "Burton
was an awfully clever young fellow, a man of great mark, in fact the
coming man." Whilst I am speaking of that system of bayonet
exercise, I may say that it was, as all he did, undervalued <i>at the
time</i>, but still it has long been the one used by the Horseguards.
Colonel Sykes, who was Richard's friend, sent for him, and sharply
rebuked him with printing a book that would do far more harm
than good.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bayonet_Exercise"></a>Bayonet Exercise.</i></div>

<p>It was thought that bayonet exercise would make the men
unsteady in the ranks. The importance of bayonet exercise was
recognized everywhere <i>except</i> in England. Richard detected our
weak point in military system, and he knew that it would be the
British soldier's forte when properly used. Richard was not "in
the ring," but when that was proved, his pamphlet was taken
down from the dusty pigeon-hole, and a few modifications&mdash;not
improvements&mdash;were added, so as to enable a just and enlightened
War Office, not to send him a word of thanks, a compliment, an
expression of official recognition, which was all his soul craved for,
but a huge letter from the Treasury, with a seal the size of a baby's
fist, with a gracious permission to draw upon the Treasury for the
sum of one shilling.</p>

<p>Richard always appreciated humour. He went to the War Office
at once, was sent to half a dozen different rooms, and, to the intense
astonishment of all the clerks, after three-quarters of an hour's very
hard work he drew his shilling, and instead of framing it, he gave it
to the first hungry beggar that he saw as soon as he came out of the
War Office.</p>

<p>"Lord love yer, sir," said the beggar.</p>

<p>"No, my man, I don't exactly expect Him to do <i>that</i>. But I
dare say you want a drink?"</p>

<p>He did not lead the life that was led by the general colony at
Boulogne. He had a little set of men friends, knew some of the
French, had a great many flirtations, one very serious one. He
passed his days in literature and fencing: at home he was most
domestic; his devotion to his parents, especially to his sick mother,
was beautiful.</p>

<p>My sisters and I were kept at French all day, music and other
studies, but were frequently turned into the Ramparts, which would
give one a mile's walk around, to do our reading; then we had a turn
down the Grande Rue, the Rue de l'Écu, the Quai, and the Pier at
the fashionable hour, for a treat, or else we were taken a long country
walk, or a long row up the river Liane in the summer time, where
we occasionally saw a Guingette; but we were religiously marched
home at half-past eight to supper and bed, unless one of the <i>créme</i>
gave a dull tea-party.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Meets_me_at_Boulogne_at_School"></a>Meets me at Boulogne at School.</i></div>

<p>One day, when we were on the Ramparts, the vision of my
awakening brain came towards us. He was five feet eleven inches
in height, very broad, thin, and muscular;<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he had very dark hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
black, clearly defined, sagacious eyebrows, a brown weather-beaten
complexion, straight Arab features, a determined-looking mouth
and chin, nearly covered by an enormous black moustache. I have
since heard a clever friend say "that he had the brow of a God, the
jaw of a Devil." But the most remarkable part of his appearance
was, two large black flashing eyes with long lashes, that pierced
you through and through. He had a fierce, proud, melancholy
expression, and when he smiled, he smiled as though it hurt him,
and looked with impatient contempt at things generally. He was
dressed in a black, short, shaggy coat, and shouldered a short thick
stick as if he was on guard.</p>

<p>He looked at me as though he read me through and through in a
moment, and started a little. I was completely magnetized, and
when we had got a little distance away I turned to my sister, and
whispered to her, "That man will marry <i>me</i>." The next day he
was there again, and he followed us, and chalked up, "May I
speak to you?" leaving the chalk on the wall, so I took up the chalk
and wrote back, "No, mother will be angry;" and mother found it,&mdash;and
<i>was</i> angry; and after that we were stricter prisoners than ever.
However, "destiny is stronger than custom." A mother and a pretty
daughter came to Boulogne, who happened to be a cousin of my
father's; they joined the majority in the Society sense, and one
day we were allowed to walk on the Ramparts with them. There I
met Richard, who&mdash;agony!&mdash;was flirting with the daughter; we were
formally introduced, and the name made me start. I will say
why later.</p>

<p>I did not try to attract his attention; but whenever he came
to the usual promenade I would invent any excuse that came,
to take another turn to watch him, if he was not looking. If
I could catch the sound of his deep voice, it seemed to me
so soft and sweet, that I remained spell-bound, as when I hear
gypsy-music. I never lost an opportunity of seeing him, when I
could not be seen, and as I used to turn red and pale, hot and
cold, dizzy and faint, sick and trembling, and my knees used to
nearly give way under me, my mother sent for the doctor, to
complain that my digestion was out of order, and that I got
migraines in the street, and he prescribed me a pill which I put in
the fire. All girls will sympathize with me. I was struck with the
shaft of Destiny, but I had no hopes (being nothing but an ugly
schoolgirl) of taking the wind out of the sails of the dashing
creature, with whom he was carrying on a very serious flirtation.</p>

<p>In early days Richard had got into a rather strong flirtation with a
very handsome and very fast girl, who had a vulgar, middle-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
sort of mother. One day he was rather alarmed at getting a polite
but somewhat imperious note from the mother, asking him to call
upon her. He obeyed, but he took with him his friend Dr. Steinhaüser,
a charming man, who looked as if his face was carved out of
wood. After the preliminaries of a rather formal reception, in a
very prim-looking drawing-room, the lady began, looking severely at
him, "I sent for you, Captain Burton, because I think it my dooty
to ask what your intentions are, with regard to my daughter?"
Richard put on his most infantile face of perplexity as he said, "Your
dooty, madam&mdash;" and, then, as if he was trying to recall things, and
after a while suddenly seizing the facts of the case, he got up and
said, "Alas! madam, strictly dishonourable," and shaking his head
as if he was going to burst into tears at his own iniquities, "I regret
to say, strictly dishonourable;" and bowed himself out with Dr.
Steinhaüser, who never moved a muscle of his face. Richard had
never done the young lady a scrap of harm, beyond talking to her
a little more than the others, because she was so "awfully jolly,"
but the next time he met her he said, "Look here, young woman,
if I talk to you, you must arrange that I do not have 'mamma's
dooty' flung at my head any more." "The old fool!" said the girl,
"how like her!"</p>

<p>The only luxury I indulged in was a short but heartfelt prayer for
him every morning. I read all his books, and was seriously struck as
before by the name when I came to the Játs in Scinde&mdash;but this I
will explain later on. My cousin asked him to write something for
me, which I used to wear next to my heart. One night an exception
was made to our dull rule of life. My cousins gave a tea-party and
dance, and "the great majority" flocked in, and there was Richard like
a star amongst rushlights. That was a Night of nights; he waltzed
with me once, and spoke to me several times, and I kept my sash
where he put his arm round my waist to waltz, and my gloves. I
never wore them again. I did not know it then, but the "little
cherub who sits up aloft" is not <i>only</i> occupied in taking care of poor
Jack, for I came in also for a share of it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mecca.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Famous_Journey_to_Mecca_and_El_Medinah"></a>His Famous Journey to Mecca and El Medinah.</i></div>

<p>Whilst leading this sort of life, on a long furlough, Richard determined
to carry out a project he had long had in his head, to study
thoroughly the "inner life of the Moslem." He had long felt within
himself the qualifications, both mental and physical, which are
needed for the exploration of dangerous regions, impossible of
access, and of disguises difficult to sustain. His career as a dervish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in Scinde greatly helped him. His mind was both practical and
imaginative; he set himself to imagine and note down every contingency
that <i>might</i> arise, and one by one he studied each separate
thing until he was master of it. As a small sample he apprenticed
himself to a blacksmith; he learned to make horseshoes and shoe
his horse.</p>

<p>To accomplish a journey to Mecca and Medinah quite safely
in those days (1853) was almost an impossibility, for the discovery
that he was <i>not</i> a Mussulman would have been avenged by a
hundred Khanjars. It meant living with his life in his hand, and
amongst the strangest and wildest companions, adopting their
unfamiliar manners, and living for perhaps nine months in the
hottest and most unhealthy climate, upon repulsive food, complete
and absolute isolation from all that makes life tolerable, from all
civilization, from all his natural habits&mdash;the brain at high tension,
never to depart from the <i>rôle</i> he had adopted.</p>

<p>He obtained a year's leave on purpose, and left London as a
Persian, for, during the time, he had to assume and sustain <i>several</i>
Oriental characters. Captain Grindlay, who was in the secret,
travelled to Southampton and Alexandria as his English interpreter.
John Thurburn, who, curiously to say, was also the host of Burckhardt
till he died, and was buried in Cairo, received Richard at
Alexandria. He and his son-in-law, John Larking, of the Firs, Lee,
Kent, were the only persons throughout the perilous expedition who
knew of his secret. He went to Cairo as a dervish, and he lived
there as a native, till (as he told me) he actually believed himself
to be what he represented himself to be, and then he felt he was
safe, and he practised on his own country-people the finding out
that he was unrecognizable. He had wished to cross the whole
length of Arabia, but the Russian War had caused disturbances,
which might have delayed him over his year's leave.</p>

<p>In those days it was almost impossible to visit the Holy City as
one of the Faithful. First, there was the pilgrim-ship to embark on;
then there were long desert caravan marches, with their privations
and their dangers; then there was the holy shrine, the Ka'abah, to
be visited, and all the ceremonies to be gone through, like a Roman
Catholic Holy Week at Rome. Burckhardt, the Swiss traveller, did
get in, but he never could see the Ka'abah, and he confessed afterwards
that he was so nervous that he was unable to take notes, and
unable to write or sketch for fear of being detected, whereas Richard
was sketching and writing in his white <i>burnous</i> the whole time he
was prostrating and kissing the holy Stone. He did not go in
mockery, but reverentially. He had brought his brain to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
himself one of them. Europeans, converted Moslems, have of late
gone there, but they have been received with the utmost civility,
consistent with coldness, have been admitted to outward friendship,
but have been carefully kept out of what they most wished to know
and see, so that Richard was thus the only European who had beheld
the inner and religious life of the Moslems as one of themselves.</p>

<p>Amongst the various Oriental characters that Richard assumed, the
one that suited best was half-Arab, half-Iranian, such as throng the
northern shores of the Persian Gulf. With long hair falling on his
shoulders, long beard, face and hands, arms and legs browned and
stained with a thin coat of henna, Oriental dress, spear in hand, and
pistols in belt, Richard became Mirza Abdullah, el Bushiri. Here he
commenced his most adventurous and romantic life, explored from
North to South, from East to West, mixed with all sorts of people
and tribes without betraying himself in manners, customs, or speech,
when death must often have ensued, had he created either dislike or
suspicion.</p>

<p>I here give a slight sketch from his private notes, and for fuller
details refer the reader to his "Pilgrimage to Mecca and El
Medinah," 3 vols., with coloured illustrations, published in 1855,
and which made a great sensation. Although he has been the
author of some eighty books and pamphlets, I think that this
original edition of three volumes is the one that his name should live
by, and it will be the first of the Uniform Library with the Meccan
Press. The Uniform Library means a reproduction of all his hitherto
published works, and eventually his unpublished ones, so that the
world may lose nothing of what he has ever written.</p>

<p>As I have said, on the night of the 3rd of April, 1853, a Persian
Mirza, accompanied by an English interpreter, Captain Henry
Grindlay, of the Bengal Cavalry, left London for Southampton, and
embarked on the P. and O. steamer <i>Bengal</i>. The voyage was profitable
but tedious; Richard passed it in resuming his Oriental
character, with such success, that when he landed at Alexandria,
he was recognized and blessed as a true Moslem by the native
population.</p>

<p class="capt">RICHARD BURTON AS HAJI ABDULLAH, EN ROUTE TO MECCA.</p>
</div>

<p>John Thurburn and his son-in-law, John Larking, received him at
their villa on the Mahmudíyah Canal, but he was lodged in an outhouse,
the better to deceive the servants. Here he practised the Korán
and prayer, and all the ceremonies of the Faith, with a neighbouring
Shaykh. He also became a <i>hakím</i>, or doctor, and called himself
Shaykh Abdullah, preparing to be a dervish. The dervish is a
chartered vagabond; nobody asks why he comes, where he goes; he
may go on foot, or on horseback, or alone, or with a large retinue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
and he is as much respected without arms, as though he were armed
to the teeth. "I only wanted," he said, "a little knowledge of medicine,
which I <i>had</i>, moderate skill in magic, a studious reputation, and
enough to keep me from starving." He provided himself with a few
necessaries for the journey.</p>

<p>When he had to leave Alexandria he wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Not without a feeling of regret, I left my little room among
the white myrtle blossoms and the rosy oleander flowers with the
almond scent. I kissed with humble ostentation my good host's
hand, in the presence of his servants. I bade adieu to my patients,
who now amounted to about fifty, shaking hands with all meekly, and
with religious equality of attention; and mounted in a 'trap'
which looked like a cross between a wheelbarrow and a dog-cart,
drawn by a kicking, jibbing, and biting mule, I set out for the
steamer, the <i>Little Asthmatic</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Start_from_Alexandria_to_Cairo"></a>His Start from Alexandria to Cairo.</i></div>

<p>"The journey from Alexandria to Cairo lasted three days and
nights. We saw nothing but muddy water, dusty banks, sand, mist,
milky sky, glaring sun, breezes like the blasts of a furnace, and the
only variation was that the steamer grounded four or five times a day,
and I passed my time telling my beads with a huge rosary. I was a
deck passenger. The sun burnt us all day, and the night dews were
raw and thick. Our diet was bread and garlic, moistened with muddy
water from the canal. At Cairo I went to a caravanserai. Here I
became a Pathán. I was born in India of Afghan parents, who had
settled there, and I was educated at Rangoon, and sent out, as is
often the custom, to wander. I knew all the languages that I required
to pass me, Persian, Hindostani, and Arabic. It is customary at the
shop, on the camel, in the Mosque, to ask, 'What is thy name?
Whence comest thou?' and you must be prepared. I had to do the
fast of the Ramazan, which is far stricter than the Catholics' Lent,
and in Cairo I studied the Moslem faith in every detail. I had great
difficulty in getting a passport without betraying myself, but the
chief of the Afghan college at the Azhar Mosque contrived it for
me. I hired a couple of camels, and put my Meccan boy and
baggage on one, and I took the other. I had an eighty-four mile
ride in midsummer, on a bad wooden saddle, on a bad dromedary,
across the Suez Desert.</p>

<p>"Above, through a sky terrible in its stainless beauty, and the
splendours of a pitiless blinding glare, the simoom caresses you like
a lion with flaming breath. Around lie drifted sand-heaps, upon
which each puff of wind leaves its trace in solid waves, frayed rocks,
the very skeletons of mountains, and hard unbroken plains, over
which he who rides is spurred by the idea that the bursting of a
waterskin, or the pricking of a camel's hoof, would be a certain
death of torture; a haggard land infested with wild beasts and
wilder men; a region whose very fountains murmur the warning
words, 'Drink and away!'</p>

<p>"In the desert, even more than upon the ocean, there is present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Death, and this sense of danger, never absent, invests the scene of
travel with a peculiar interest.</p>

<p>"Let the traveller who suspects exaggeration leave the Suez road,
and gallop northwards over the sands for an hour or two; in the
drear silence, the solitude, and the fantastic desolation of the place,
he will feel what the desert <i>may</i> be. And then the oases, and little
lines of fertility&mdash;how soft and how beautiful!&mdash;even though the
Wady-el-Ward ('the Vale of Flowers') be the name of some stern
flat in which a handful of wild shrubs blossom, while struggling
through a cold season's ephemeral existence.</p>

<p>"In such circumstances the mind is influenced through the body.
Though your mouth glows, and your skin is parched, yet you feel
no languor,&mdash;the effect of humid heat; your lungs are lightened, your
sight brightens, your memory recovers its tone, and your spirits
become exuberant. Your fancy and imagination are powerfully
aroused, and the wildness and sublimity of the scenes around you,
stir up all the energies of your soul, whether for exertion, danger,
or strife. Your <i>morale</i> improves; you become frank and cordial,
hospitable and single-minded; the hypocritical politeness and the
slavery of Civilization are left behind you in the City. Your senses
are quickened; they require no stimulants but air and exercise; in
the desert spirituous liquors excite only disgust.</p>

<p>"There is a keen enjoyment in mere animal existence. The
sharp appetite disposes of the most indigestible food; the sand is
softer than a bed of down, and the purity of the air suddenly puts
to flight a dire cohort of diseases.</p>

<p>"Here Nature returns to Man, however unworthily he has treated
her, and, believe me, when once your tastes have conformed to the
tranquillity of such travel, you will suffer real pain in returning to
the turmoil of civilization. You will anticipate the bustle and the
confusion of artificial life, its luxuries and its false pleasures, with
repugnance. Depressed in spirits, you will for a time after your
return feel incapable of mental or bodily exertion. The air of Cities
will suffocate you, and the careworn and cadaverous countenances
of citizens will haunt you like a vision of judgment.</p>

<p>"I was nearly undone by Mohammed, my Meccan boy, finding
my sextant amongst my clothes, and it was only by Umar Effendi
having read a letter of mine to Haji Wali that very morning on
Theology, that he was able to certify that I was thoroughly
orthodox.</p>

<p>"When I started my intention had been to cross the all but
unknown Arabian Peninsula, and to map it out, either from El
Medinah to Maskat, or from Mecca to Makallah on the Indian
Ocean. I wanted to open a market for horses between Arabia
and Central India, to go through the Rubá-el-Khali ('the Empty
Abode'), the great wilderness on our maps, to learn the hydrography
of the Hejaz, and the ethnographical details of this race of Arabs.
I should have been very much at sea without my sextant. I managed
to secrete a pocket compass.</p>

<p>"The journey would have been of fifteen or sixteen hundred miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and have occupied at least ten months longer than my leave. The
quarrelling of the tribes prevented my carrying it out. I had
arranged with the Beni Harb, the Bedawin tribe, to join them after
the Pilgrimage like a true Bedawin, but it <i>meant</i> all this above-mentioned
work; I found it useless to be killed in a petty tribe-quarrel,
perhaps, about a mare, and once I joined them it would
have been a point of honour to aid in all their quarrels and
raids.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Twelve_Days_in_an_Open_Sambuk"></a>Twelve Days in an Open Sambúk.</i></div>

<p>"At Suez we embarked on a <i>Sambúk</i>, an open boat of about fifty
tons. She had no means of reefing, no compass, no log, no sounding-line,
no chart. Ninety-seven pilgrims (fifteen women and children)
came on deck. They were all barefoot, bare-headed, dirty, ferocious,
and armed. The distance was doubled by detours; it would have
been six hundred miles in a straight line. Even the hardened Arabs
and Africans suffered most severely. After twelve days of purgatory,
I sprang ashore at Yambú; and travelling a fortnight in this
pilgrim-boat gave me the fullest possible knowledge of the inner life
of El Islam. However, the heat of the sun, the heavy night dews,
and the constant washing of the waves over me, had so affected one
of my feet that I could hardly put it to the ground.</p>

<p>"Yambú is the port of El Medinah, as Jeddah is that of Mecca.
The people are a good type, healthy, proud, and manly, and they
have considerable trade. Here I arranged for camels, and our
Caravan hired an escort of irregular cavalry&mdash;very necessary, for, as
the tribes were out, we had to fight every day. They did not want
to start till the tribes had finished fighting; but I was resolved,
and we went. Here I brought a <i>shugduf</i>, or litter, and seven days'
provisions for the journey, and here also I became an Arab, to
avoid paying the capitation tax, the <i>Jizyát</i>.</p>

<p>"We eventually arrived at El Hamra, the 'Red Village,' but in
a short while the Caravan arrived from Mecca, and in about four
hours we joined it and went on our way. That evening we were
attacked by Bedawi, and we had fighting pretty nearly the whole
way. We lost twelve men, camels, and other beasts of burden; the
Bedawi looted the baggage and ate the camels.</p>

<p>"One morning El Medinah was in sight. We were jaded and hungry;
and we gloried in the gardens and orchards about the town. I
was met at El Medinah by Shaykh Hamid, who received me into
his family as one of the faithful, and where I led a quiet, peaceful,
and pleasant life, during leisure hours; but of course, the pilgrimage
being my object, I had a host of shrines to visit, ceremonies to
perform, and prayers to recite, besides the usual prayers five times
a day; for it must be remembered that El Medinah contains the
tomb of Mahommad." (For description see Burton's 'Mecca and El
Medinah,' 3 vols.)</p>

<p>"The Damascus Caravan was to start on the 27th Zu'l Ka'adah
(1st September). I had intended to stay at El Medinah till the last
moment, and to accompany the <i>Kafilat el Tayyárah</i>, or the 'Flying
Caravan,' which usually leaves on the 2nd Zu'l Hijjah, two days
after that of Damascus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suddenly arose the rumour that there would be no <i>Tayyárah</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_45" id="FNanchor_2_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_45" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and that all pilgrims must proceed with the Damascus Caravan
or await the <i>Rakb</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_46" id="FNanchor_3_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_46" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Sheríf Zayd, Sa'ad, the robbers' only
friend, paid Sa'ad an unsuccessful visit. Sa'ad demanded back his
shaykhship, in return for a safe conduct through his country;
'otherwise,' said he, 'I will cut the throat of every hen that
ventures into the passes.'</p>

<p>"The Sheríf Zayd returned to El Medinah on the 25th Zu'l Ka'adah.
(30th August). Early on the morning of the next day, Shaykh
Hamid returned hurriedly from the bazar, exclaiming, 'You must
make ready at once, Effendi! There will be no <i>Tayyárah</i>. All
Hajis start to-morrow. Allah will make it easy to you! Have you
your water-skins in order? You are to travel down the Darb el
Sharki, <i>where you will not see water for three days!</i>'</p>

<p>"Poor Hamid looked horror-struck as he concluded this fearful
announcement, which filled me with joy. Burckhardt had visited
and described the Darb el Sultani, the 'High' or 'Royal Road'
along the coast; but <i>no</i> European had as yet travelled down by
Harún el Rashíd's and the Lady Zubaydah's celebrated route
through the Nejd Desert. And here was my chance!</p>

<p>"Whenever he was ineffably disgusted, I consoled him with singing
the celebrated song of Maysúnah, the beautiful Bedawin wife of the
Caliph Muawíyah." (Richard was immensely fond of this little song,
and the Bedawin screams with joy when he hears it.)</p>

</p>

<p>"The old man was delighted, clapped my shoulder, and exclaimed,
'Verily, O Father of Moustachios, I will show thee the black Tents
of my Tribe this year.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Ten_Days_Ride_to_Mecca"></a>Ten Days' Ride to Mecca.</i></div>

<p>"So, after staying at Medinah about six weeks, I set out with the
Damascus Caravan down the Darb el Sharki, under the care of a
very venerable Bedawin, who nicknamed me 'Abú Shuwárib,' meaning,
'Father of Moustachios,' mine being very large. I found myself
standing opposite the Egyptian gate of El Medinah, surrounded by
my friends&mdash;those friends of a day, who cross the phantasmagoria of
one's life. There were affectionate embraces and parting mementoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
The camels were mounted; I and the boy Mohammed in the litter
or <i>shugduf</i>, and Shaykh Nur in his cot. The train of camels
with the Caravan wended its way slowly in a direction from north
to north-east, gradually changing to eastward. After an hour's
travel, the Caravan halted to turn and take farewell of the Holy
City.</p>

<p>"We dismounted to gaze at the venerable minarets and the green
dome which covers the tomb of the Prophet. The heat was dreadful,
the climate dangerous, and the beasts died in numbers. Fresh carcases
strewed our way, and were covered with foul vultures. The Caravan
was most picturesque. We travelled principally at night, but the
camels had to perform the work of goats, and step from block to
block of basalt like mountaineers, which being unnatural to them,
they kept up a continual piteous moan. The simoom and pillars of
sand continually threw them over.</p>

<p>"Water is the great trouble of a Caravan journey, and the only
remedy is to be patient and not to talk. The first two hours gives
you the mastery, but if you drink you cannot stop. Forty-seven
miles before we reached Mecca, at El Zaríbah, we had to perform
the ceremony of <i>El Ihram</i>, meaning 'to assume the pilgrim garb.'
A barber shaved us, trimmed our moustachios; we bathed and
perfumed, and then we put on two new cotton cloths, each six
feet long by three and a half broad. It is white, with narrow red
stripes and fringe, and worn something as you wear it in the baths.
Our heads and feet, right shoulder and arm, are exposed.</p>

<p>"We had another fight before we got to Mecca, and a splendid
camel in front of me was shot through the heart. Our Sheríf Zayd
was an Arab Chieftain of the purest blood, and very brave. He
took two or three hundred men, and charged them. However,
they shot many of our dromedaries, and camels, and boxes and
baggage strewed the place; and when we were gone the Bedawi
would come back, loot the baggage, and eat the camels. On
Saturday, the 10th of September, at one in the morning, there
was great excitement in the Caravan, and loud cries of 'Mecca!
Mecca! Oh, the Sanctuary, the Sanctuary!' All burst into loud
praises, and many wept. We reached it next morning, after ten
days and nights from El Medinah. I became the guest of the boy
Mohammed, in the house of his mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Moslem_Holy_Week"></a>Moslem Holy Week.</i></div>

<p>"First I did the circumambulation at the Haram. Early next
morning I was admitted to the house of our Lord; and we went to
the holy well Zemzem, the holy water of Mecca,<a name="FNanchor_5_48" id="FNanchor_5_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_48" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and then the
Ka'abah, in which is inserted the famous black stone, where they
say a prayer for the Unity of Allah. Then I performed the seven
circuits round the Ka'abah, called the <i>Tawaf</i>. I then managed to
have a way pushed for me through the immense crowd to kiss it.
While kissing it, and rubbing hands and forehead upon it, I narrowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
observed it, and came away persuaded that it is an aerolite. It
is curious that almost all agree upon one point, namely, that the
stone is volcanic. Ali Bey calls it mineralogically a 'block of
volcanic basalt, whose circumference is sprinkled with little crystals,
pointed and straw-like, with rhombs of tile-red felspath upon a dark
ground like velvet or charcoal, except one of its protuberances,
which is reddish.' It is also described as 'a lava containing
several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellowish
substance.'</p>

<p>"All this time the pilgrims had scorched feet and burning heads,
as they were always uncovered. I was much impressed with the
strength and steadfastness of the Mohammedan religion. It was
so touching to see them; one of them was clinging to the curtain,
and sobbing as though his heart would break.<a name="FNanchor_6_49" id="FNanchor_6_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_49" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At night I and
Shaykh Nur and the boy Mohammed issued forth with the lantern
and praying-carpet.</p>

<p>"The moon, now approaching the full, tipped the brow of Abú<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Kubáya, and lit up the spectacle with a more solemn light. In the
midst stood the huge bier-like erection&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">'Black as the wings<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which some spirit of ill o'er a sepulchre flings!'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>except where the moonbeams streaked it like jets of silver falling
upon the darkest marble. It formed the point of rest for the eye;
the little pagoda-like buildings and domes around it, with all their
gilding and framework, faded to the sight. One object, unique in
appearance, stood in view&mdash;the temple of the one Allah, the God
of Abraham, of Ishmael, and of their posterity. Sublime it was, and
expressing by all the eloquence of fancy the grandeur of the one
idea which vitalized El Islam, and the strength and steadfastness of
its votaries.</p>

<p>"One thing I remarked, and think worthy of notice, is that ever
since Noah's dove, every religion seems to consider the pigeon a
sacred bird; for example, every Mosque swarms with pigeons; St.
Mark's, at Venice, and the same exists in most Italian market-places;
the Hindoo pandits and the old Assyrian Empire also
have them; whilst Catholics make it the emblem of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"The day before I went to Arafat, I spent the night in the Mosque,
where I saw many strange sights. One was a negro possessed by
the devil. There, too, he prayed by the grave of Ishmael. After
this we set out for Arafat, where is the tomb of Adam. (I have
seen two since&mdash;one at Jerusalem, and one in the mountains behind
Damascus.)</p>

<p>"It was a very weary journey, and, with the sun raining fire on our
heads and feet, we suffered tortures. The camels threw themselves
on the ground, and I myself saw five men fall out and die. On
the Mount there were numerous consecrated shrines to see, and we
had to listen to an immensely long sermon. On the great festival
day we stoned the Devil, each man with seven stones washed in
seven waters, and we said, while throwing each stone, 'In the name
of Allah&mdash;and Allah is Almighty&mdash;I do this in hatred of the Devil,
and to his shame.' There is then an immense slaughter of victims
(five or six thousand), which slaughter, with the intense heat, swarms
of flies, and the whole space reeking with blood, produces the most
noisome vapours, and probably is the birthplace of that cholera
and small-pox which generally devastate the World after the Haj.
<i>Now</i> we were allowed to doff the pilgrim's garb.</p>

<p>"We all went to barbers' booths, where we were shaved, had our
beards trimmed and our nails cut, saying prayers the while; and,
though we had no clothes, we might put our clothes over our heads,
and wear our slippers, which were a little protection from the heat.
We might then twirl our moustachios, stroke our beards, and return
to Mecca. At the last moment I was sent for. I thought, 'Now
something is going to happen to me; now I am suspected.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_All-important_Crisis"></a>The All-important Crisis.</i></div>

<p>"A crowd had gathered round the Ka'abah, and I had no wish to
stand bare-headed and bare-footed in the midday September sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
At the cry of 'Open a path for the Haji who would enter the
House!' the gazers made way. Two stout Meccans, who stood below
the door, raised me in their arms, whilst a third drew me from above
into the building. At the entrance I was accosted by several
officials, dark-looking Meccans, of whom the blackest and plainest
was a youth of the Benu Shaybah family, the true blood of the El
Hejaz. He held in his hand the huge silver-gilt padlock of the
Ka'abah, and presently, taking his seat upon a kind of wooden press
in the left corner of the hall, he officially inquired my name, nation,
and other particulars. The replies were satisfactory, and the boy
Mohammed was authoritatively ordered to conduct me round the
building, and to recite the prayers. I will not deny that, looking at
the windowless walls, the officials at the door, and a crowd of excited
fanatics below&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'And the place death, considering who I was,'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>my feelings were of the trapped-rat description, acknowledged by the
immortal nephew of his uncle Perez. A blunder, a hasty action, a
misjudged word, a prayer or bow, not strictly the right shibboleth,
and my bones would have whitened the desert sand. This did not,
however, prevent my carefully observing the scene during our
long prayer, and making a rough plan with a pencil upon my white
<i>ihram</i>.</p>

<p class="capt">MECCA AND THE KA'ABAH, OR THE HOLY GRAIL OF THE MOSLEMS.</p>
</div>


<p>"I returned home after this <i>quite</i> exhausted, performed an elaborate
toilet, washing with henna and warm water, to mitigate the pain the
sun had caused on my arms, shoulders, and breast, head and feet,
and put on my gayest clothes in honour of the festival. When the
moon rose, there was a second stoning, or lapidation, to be performed,
and then we strolled round the coffee-houses. There was
also a little pilgrimage to undertake, which is in honour of Hagar
seeking water for her son Ishmael.</p>

<p>"I now began to long to leave Mecca; I had done everything,
seen everything; the heat was simply unendurable, and the little
room where I could enjoy privacy for about six hours a day, and jot
my notes down, was a perfect little oven.<a name="FNanchor_7_50" id="FNanchor_7_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_50" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"I slowly wended my way with a Caravan to Jeddah, with donkeys
and Mohammed; I must say that the sight of the sea and the
British flag was a pleasant tonic. I went to the British Consulate,
but the Dragomans were not very civil to the unfortunate Afghan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Safe_Return"></a>His Safe Return.</i></div>

<p>"So I was left kicking my heels at the Great Man's Gate for a long
time, and heard somebody say, 'Let the dirty nigger wait.' Long
inured to patience, however, I did wait, and when the Consul
consented to see me, I presented him with a bit of paper, as if it
were a money order. On it was written, 'Don't recognize me; I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Dick Burton, but I am not safe yet. Give me some money' (naming
the sum), 'which will be returned from London, and don't take any
notice of me.' He, however, frequently afterwards, when it was
dark, sent for me, and, once safe in his private rooms, showed me
abundance of hospitality. Necessity compelled me living with Shayk
Nur in a room (to myself), swept, sprinkled with water, and spread
with mats.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="On_Board_an_English_Ship"></a>On Board an English Ship.</i></div>

<p>"When I went out in gay attire, I was generally mistaken for the
Pasha of El Medinah. After about ten days' suspense, an English
ship was sent by the Bombay Steam Navigation Company to convey
pilgrims from El Hejaz to India, so one day the Afghan disappeared&mdash;was
supposed to have departed with other dirty pilgrims, but in
reality, had got on board the <i>Dwárká</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_51" id="FNanchor_8_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_51" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> an English ship, with a first-class
passage; he had emerged from his cabin, after washing all his
colouring off, in the garb of an English gentleman; experienced
the greatest kindness from the Commander and Officers, which
he much needed, being worn out with fatigue and the fatal fiery
heat, and felt the great relief to his mind and body from being
able to take his first complete rest in safety on board an English
ship; but was so changed that the Turkish pilgrims, who crowded
the deck, never recognized their late companion pilgrim."</p></blockquote>

<p>He ends his personal narrative of his sojourn in El Hejaz thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have been exposed to perils, and I have escaped from them;
I have traversed the sea, and have not succumbed under the severest
fatigues; but they with fatal fiery heat have worn me out, and my
heart is moved with emotions of gratitude that I have been permitted
to effect the objects I had in view."</p></blockquote>

<p>An Irish missionary wrote of my husband after he was dead:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At Damascus Burton began a new chapter, but he was not permitted
to start with a clean page. Two incidents in his previous
record foreshadowed him, and hampered him in his efforts to
make the best of his new Consulate. He had offended the religious
susceptibilities of both Mohammedans and Christians, and he found
himself confronted with bitter, unreasoning prejudice.</p>

<p>"It is a question of how far Burton's Oriental disguise concealed
the Englishman in his pilgrimage to Mecca. I never conversed
with a Mohammedan who had accompanied Burton on that journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
but I have seen Arabs who saw Palgrave on his way to Nejd, and
his attempts to pose as a native were a constant source of amusement
to all with whom he came in contact. Burton's Oriental cast
of face helped him when putting on the outward appearance of a
Bedawin, but at no period of his life could he have passed for an Arab
one second after he began to speak.<a name="FNanchor_9_52" id="FNanchor_9_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_52" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> On the pilgrimage to Mecca,
Burton would be known as a devout British Mohammedan, just as
easily as we recognize an Arab convert on a missionary platform,
notwithstanding the efforts of the schoolmaster and the tailor to
transform him into an Englishman. And as a perverted Englishman,
Burton would be as welcome in the Hajj as a converted Arab
would be in Exeter Hall."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a ridiculous paragraph, and spoils an otherwise splendid
article. The writer speaks fairly good Syrian Christian Arabic with an
Irish accent, but he is not conversant with the Arabic of scholars and
high-class Mohammedans, and he does not know a word of Persian,
Hindostani, Afghani, Turkish, or any of the other ten Oriental
languages, in which my husband passed his pilgrimages. I think
native testimony is best. I can remember, at a reception at Lady
Salisbury's, the Persian Ambassador and his suite following Richard
about the whole evening, and when I joked them about it, they said,
"It is such an extraordinary thing to us, to see any foreigner,
especially an Englishman, speaking our language like ourselves.
He might have never been out of Teheran; he even knows all the
slang of the market-place as well as we do." When he arrived in
Damascus, his record was perfectly clean with the Mohammedans,
and the only bitter, unreasoning prejudice was in the breast of
Christian missionaries, and Christian Foreign Office employés, whose
friends wanted the post. Burton and Palgrave were quite two
different men, as silver and nickel. I know exactly the <i>sort</i> of
Arabic Palgrave spoke.</p>

<p>In the days that Richard went to Mecca, <i>no</i> converted Englishman
would have been received as <i>now</i>. As to his Arabic, Abd el Kadir
told me&mdash;and, mind, he was <i>the</i> highest cultivated and the most
religious Moslem in Damascus; the only Sufi, I believe&mdash;that there
were only two men in Damascus whose Arabic was worth listening
to; one was my husband, and the other was Shaykh Mijwal El
Mezrab, Lady Ellenborough's Bedawin husband. We may remember
that at Jeddah his life was saved by being mistaken for the Pasha
of El Medinah, and when he went to the departure of the Haj at
Damascus, as he rode down the lines in frock-coat and fez, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
accosted by more than one as the Pasha of the Haj; and when the
mistake was explained, and he told them who he was, they only
laughed and said, "Why don't you come along with us again to Mecca,
as you did before?" He was looked upon by <i>all</i> as a friend to the
Moslem. He <i>never</i> profaned the sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina,
and so far from being unpopular with the Moslems, he received
almost yearly an invitation to go back with the Haj, and no opposition
would have been made to him had he made another pilgrimage
to the jealously guarded Haramayn or the holy Cities of the Moslems.
Even <i>I</i> am always admitted to the Mosques with the women for <i>his</i>
sake.</p>

<p>There was no tinsel and gingerbread about anything Richard did;
it was always true and real.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Interesting_Letters"></a>Interesting Letters.</i></div>

<p>In further support of the above I quote two letters, one from
<i>Sporting Truth</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had the pleasure of a slight acquaintance with the late Sir
Richard Burton, familiarly known among his friends as 'Ruffian
Dick.' Not that there was anything offensive meant by that epithet.
Indeed, in his case, it had a playfully complimentary significance.
There were, in the old days, as many readers of <i>Sporting Truth</i>
will recollect, two familiar pugilists who went by the nicknames
respectively of the 'Old' and 'Young Ruffian.' The term referred
purely to their style of fighting, and was not intended to convey
the idea that they were any less decent or civilized members of
society than their neighbours. For much the same reason was
Sir Richard Burton dubbed 'Ruffian Dick' by his pals. He was,
without doubt, a terrible fighter, and fought in single combat
more enemies than perhaps any man of his time. A man of peculiar
temper, too, and strong individuality, with a wholesome contempt
for Mrs. Grundy and all her ways. But his great distinguishing
feature was his courage. No braver man than 'Ruffian Dick' ever
lived. His daring was of that romantic order which revels in
danger for danger's sake. No crisis, however appalling, could
shake his splendid nerve. He was as cool when his life hung on
a hair's breadth, as when he sat smoking in his own snuggery.</p>

<p>"I know of nothing in the annals of adventure to surpass his
memorable journey to Mecca with the Mohammedan pilgrims.
None but a follower of the true Prophet had ever penetrated the
shrine where the coffin of Mohammed swings between earth and
heaven. No eyes but those of the faithful were permitted to gaze
upon that holy of holies. Certain and speedy death awaited any
infidel who should profane with his footsteps those sacred precincts,
or seek to pry into those hidden mysteries. There were secret
passwords among the pilgrims, by which they could detect at once
any one who was not of the true faith; and detection meant instant
death at the hands of the enraged fanatics. Yet all these difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and dangers&mdash;apparently insurmountable&mdash;did not deter Ruffian
Dick from undertaking the perilous enterprise. He went through
a long course of preparation, studied all the minute ways of the
Arabs&mdash;he already spoke their language like a native&mdash;professed
the Mohammedan religion, acquired the secret passwords, and then
boldly joined the great annual procession of pilgrims to the shrine
of the Prophet.</p>

<p>"How perfect his disguise was, the following anecdote will show.
On his return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, his leave had expired,
and he had to return to India at once without time to rig himself
out with a fresh outfit. One evening a party of officers were
lounging outside Shepherd's Hotel, at Cairo. As they sat talking
and smoking, there passed repeatedly in front of them an Arab in
his loose flowing robes, with head proudly erect, and the peculiar
swinging stride of those sons of the desert. As he strode backwards
and forwards he drew nearer and nearer to the little knot of officers,
till at last, as he swept by, the flying folds of his burnous brushed
against one of the officers. 'Damn that nigger's impudence!' said
the officer; 'if he does that again I'll kick him.' To his surprise
the dignified Arab suddenly halted, wheeled round, and exclaimed,
'Well, damn it, Hawkins, that's a nice way to welcome a fellow
after two years' absence.' 'By G&mdash;d, it's Ruffian Dick,' cried
Hawkins. And Ruffian Dick it was, but utterly transformed out
of all resemblance to a European. His complexion was burned by
the sun to a deep umber tint, and his cast of features was more
Oriental than English, so that in the robes of an Arab he might
well pass for one of that nomad race."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is the second, from <i>Allen's Indian Mail</i>.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Late Sir Richard Burton.</span></h4>


<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Times</i> of India.</h5>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p>"Unlike your correspondent, Mr. Levick (of Suez), questioning
Sir Richard's visit to Medinah in 1853, I merely want to
say that in Sir Richard the scientific world has lost a bright star.
In linguistic attainments there was not his equal in the world. He
could not only speak the languages, but act so well that his most
intimate friends were often deceived. I was often witness to this
feat of his while at Kurrachee in 1847, as I happened to be employed
under Dr. Stocks, botanist, in Sind, as his botanical draughtsman.
Sir Richard (then a lieutenant) and the doctor occupied the
same bungalow. I had necessarily to work in the hall, and consequently
had the opportunity of seeing and admiring his ways. He
was on special duty, which in his case meant to perfect himself for
some political duty, by mastering the languages of the country.
When I knew him he was master of half a dozen languages, which
he wrote and spoke so fluently that a stranger who did not see
him and heard him speaking would fancy he heard a native. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
domestic servants were&mdash;a Portuguese, with whom he spoke Portuguese
and Goanese, an African, a Persian, and a Sindi or Belochee.
These spoke their mother tongue to Sir Richard as he was engaged
in his studies with <i>moonshees</i>, who relieved each other every two
hours, from ten to four daily. The <i>moonshees</i> would read an hour
and converse the next, and it was a treat to hear Sir Richard talk;
one would scarcely be able to distinguish the Englishman from a
Persian, Arabian, or a Scindian.</p>

<p>"His habits at home were perfectly Persian or Arabic. His hair
was dressed <i>à la Persian</i>&mdash;long and shaved from the forehead to
the top of the head; his eyes, by some means or other he employed,
resembled Persian or Arabian; he used the Turkish bath and wore
a cowl; and when he went out for a ride he used a wig and goggles.
His complexion was also thorough Persian, so that Nature evidently
intended him for the work he afterwards so successfully performed,
namely, visiting the shrine of the Prophet Mohammed&mdash;a work very
few would have undertaken unless he was a complete master of
himself.</p>

<p>"I was a witness to his first essay in disguising himself as a
poor Persian, and taking in his friend Moonshee Ali Akbar (the
father of Mirza Hossein, solicitor of this City). The <i>moonshee</i>
was seated one evening in an open space in front of his bungalow
in the town of Kurrachee, with a lot of his friends enjoying the
evening breeze, and chatting away as Persians are wont to do. Sir
Richard, disguised as a Persian traveller, approached them, and
after the usual compliments, inquired for the rest-house, and, as a
matter of course, gave a long rigmarole account of his travels and
of people the <i>moonshee</i> knew, and thus excited his curiosity and
got him into conversation; and when he thought he acted his part
to perfection, bid him the time and left him, but did not go far
when he called out to the <i>moonshee</i> in English if he did not know
him. The <i>moonshee</i> was completely taken aback; he did not know
where the voice (his friend Burton's) came from, till he was addressed
again, and a recognition took place, to the great astonishment of the
<i>moonshee</i> and his friends. Such a jovial companion Sir Richard
was, that his bungalow was the resort of the learned men of the
place, amongst whom I noticed Major (afterwards General) Walter
Scott, Lieutenant (and now General) Alfred De Lisle, Lieutenant
Edward Dansey of Mooltan notoriety, Dr. Stocks, and many others,
but who, with the exception of General De Lisle, are all gone to
their home above, where Sir Richard has now followed. May their
souls rest in peace!</p>

<p>"Some time or other Lady Burton may write a memoir of Sir
Richard's life, and a slight incident as the one I have related may
be of use to her, and if you think as I do, and consider it worth
inserting in a corner of your paper, I shall be very much obliged
to you if you will do so.</p>

<p>"Yours, etc.,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>On the return journey from Mecca, when Richard could secure any
privacy, he composed the most exquisite gem of Oriental poetry, that
I have ever heard or imagined, nor do I believe it has its equal,
either from the pen of Hafiz, Saadi, Shakespeare, Milton, Swinburne,
or any other. It is quite unique; it is called the Kasîdah, or the
"Lay of the Higher Law," by Haji Abdu el-Yezdi. It will ride over
the heads of most, it will displease many, but it will appeal to all
large hearts and large brains for its depth, height, breadth, for
its heart, nobility, its pathos, its melancholy, its despair. It is the
very perfection of romance, it seems the cry of a Soul wandering
through space, looking for what it does not find. I have read it
many times during my married life, and never without bitter tears,
and when I read it now, it affects me still more; he used to take it
away from me, it impressed me so. I give you the poem here in
full.</p>

<p>It reminds me more than any other thing of the Rubáiyát of Omar
Khayyâm, the astronomer-poet of Khorasán, known as the tent-maker,
written in the eleventh century, which poem was made
known by Mr. Edward Fitzgerald in about 1861, to Richard Burton,
to Swinburne, and Dante Rossetti. Richard at once claimed him
as a brother Sufi, and said that all his allusions are purely typical,

<p>I shall reproduce the "Kasîdah" in its entirety, with its fifteen
pages of copious annotations, in the Uniform Library of Sir Richard's
works which I am editing. I give the annotations in the Appendix.</p>

<p>It is a poem of extraordinary power on the nature and destiny of
Man, anti-Christian and Pantheistic. So much wealth of Oriental
learning has rarely been compressed into so small a compass.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">To The Reader.</span></h4>

<p>The Translator has ventured to entitle a "Lay of the Higher Law" the following Composition,
which aims at being in advance of its time; and he has not feared the danger of collision with such
unpleasant forms as the "Higher Culture." The principles which justify the name are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Author asserts that Happiness and Misery are equally divided and distributed in the world.</p>

<p>He makes Self-cultivation, with due regard to others, the sole and sufficient object of human
life.</p>

<p>He suggests that the affections, the sympathies and the "divine gift of Pity" are man's highest
enjoyments.</p>

<p>He advocates suspension of judgment, with a proper suspicion of "Facts, the idlest of
superstitions."</p>

<p>Finally, although destructive to appearance, he is essentially reconstructive.</p>

<p>For other details concerning the Poem and the Poet, the curious reader is referred to the end of
the volume (<i>i.e.</i> the Appendix).<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hour is nigh; the waning Queen walks forth to rule the later night;<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Crown'd with the sparkle of a Star, and throned on orb of ashen light:<br /></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Wolf-tail<a name="FNanchor_10_53" id="FNanchor_10_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_53" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> sweeps the paling East to leave a deeper gloom behind,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Dawn uprears her shining head, sighing with semblance of a wind:<br /></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The highlands catch yon Orient gleam, while purpling still the lowlands lie;<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And pearly mists, the morning-pride, soar incense-like to greet the sky.<br /></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The horses neigh, the camels groan, the torches gleam, the cressets flare;<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The town of canvas falls, and man with din and dint invadeth air:<br /></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Golden Gates swing right and left; up springs the Sun with flamy brow;<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The dew-cloud melts in gush of light; brown Earth is bathed in morning-glow.<br /></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Slowly they wind athwart the wild, and while young Day his anthem swells,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sad falls upon my yearning ear the tinkling of the Camel-bells:<br /></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O'er fiery waste and frozen wold, o'er horrid hill and gloomy glen,<br /></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the short solace of the ridge, by gentle zephyrs played upon,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose breezy head and bosky side front seas of cooly celadon;&mdash;<br /></span>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That Eve so gay, so bright, so glad, this Morn so dim, and sad, and grey;<br /></span>

acting "Excelsior," should leave a track of light behind him on this
World as he passes through. His idea of God was so immeasurably
grander than anything people are <i>usually</i> taught to think about God.
It always seemed to him that we dwindled God down to our own
mean imaginations; that we made something like ourselves, only
bigger, and far crueller. There is some truth in this; we are always
talking about God just as if we understood Him. His idea of a
Divine Being was so infinite, so great, that to pray to Him was an
impertinence; that it was monstrous that we should expect Him to
alter one of His decrees, because <i>we</i> prayed for it; that He was a
God of big universal love, but so far off, as to be far above anything
we can understand. These were the <i>utmost</i> extent of his <i>own</i>
Agnostic fits.</p>

<p>Almost contemporary with these sentiments, I find the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Bright imaged in the glassy lake below,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">While all of heaven was bright and gay.</span><br />

<p>He was always in one of the two extremes, meaning <i>All</i> or
<i>Nothing</i>. It is what we Catholics call "resisting of Divine grace;"
it is what Agnostics would call "resisting a temptation," or the
correct shibboleth, I believe, is "upholding his integrity," <i>i.e.</i> disbelieving
in God and another <i>world</i>, which he <i>never did</i> at any time
of his life.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h3>

<h4>HARAR&mdash;THE MOSLEM ABYSSINIA&mdash;THE TIMBUCTOO OF EAST AFRICA,
THE EXPLORATION OF WHICH HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED IN VAIN
BY SOME THIRTY TRAVELLLERS.</h4>


<p>Richard returned up the Red Sea to Egypt, and much enjoyed the
rest and safety for a short time, and then returned to Bombay, his
leave being up; but the wandering fever was still upon him, and as
the most difficult place for a white man to enter was Harar, in
Somali-land, Abyssinia, he determined that that should be his object.
It is inhabited by a very dangerous race to deal with, and no white
man had ever penetrated to Harar. The first white man who went
to Abyssinia was kept prisoner till he died. The East India Company
had long wished to explore it, because Berberah, the chief port
of Somali-land, is the safest and best harbour on the western side of
the Indian Ocean&mdash;far better than Aden. They went to work with
that strange mixture of caution and generosity with which they
treated those of their servants who stepped out of what Richard
calls their "quarter-deck" routine, that is, to let him go as a private
traveller, and the Government to give him no protection, but would
allow him to retain the same pay that he would enjoy whilst on
leave. Dr. Carter and others refused to do more than to coast
along in a cruiser.</p>

<p>Richard applied for Lieutenant Herne, of the 1st Bombay
Fusiliers, Lieutenant Stroyan, Indian Navy, and Lieutenant Speke,
46th Bengal Native Infantry. Herne was distinguished by his surveys,
photography, and mechanics on the west coast of India, in
Scinde, and on the Punjaub rivers; Stroyan as amateur surveyor;
and Speke, collector of the Fauna of Tibet and the Himalayas and
sportsman. Assistant-Surgeon Ellerton Stocks, botanist, traveller,
and a first-rate man in all ways, died before the expedition started.</p>

<p>Jealousy, as usual, immediately rose up in opposition. First, Sir
James Outram, Political Resident at Aden, called it a tempting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Providence, and Dr. Buist, the editor of the <i>Bombay Times</i>, was told
to run down the Somali Expedition, in which task he was assisted
by the unpopular chaplain. This was not very gratifying to four
high-spirited men; so, instead of using Berberah as a base of operations,
then westward to Harar, and then south-east to Zanzibar, the
Resident changed the whole scheme and made it fail. Herne was to
go to Berberah, where he was joined later by Stroyan. Speke was to
land in a small harbour called Bunder Guray, and to trace the watershed
of the Wady Nogal, to buy horses and camels, and collect red
earth with gold in it; but his little expedition failed through his
guide's treachery. Herne and Stroyan succeeded. Richard reserved
for himself the post of danger. Harar was as difficult to enter as
Mecca. It is the southernmost masonry-built settlement in North
Equatorial Africa. He would go as an Arab merchant. Harar had
never been visited, has its own language, its own unique history and
traditions. The language was unwritten, but he wrote a grammar,
and a vocabulary in which the etymology is given, and there he had
enough savage anthropology to interest him.
He writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the first place, Berberah is the true key of the Red Sea,
the centre of East African traffic, and the only safe place for shipping
upon the Western Erythræan shore, from Suez to Guardafui,
backed by lands capable of cultivation, and by hills covered with
pine and other valuable trees, enjoying a comparatively temperate
climate, with a regular, though thin monsoon. This harbour has
been coveted by many a foreign conqueror. Circumstances have
thrown it into our arms, and if we refuse a chance, another and
a rival nation will not be so blind. [We have since given it away,
and kept the far inferior Aden.] We are bound to protect the lives
of subjects on this coast. In 1825 the crew of the <i>Mary Ann</i> brig
was treacherously murdered by the Somal. They continued in that
state, and if to-morrow a Peninsular and Oriental Company steamer
by any chance fell into their power, it would be the same history.
Harar, scarcely three hundred miles distance from Aden, is a
counterpart of the ill-famed Timbuctoo. A tradition exists that
with the entrance of the first Christian, Harar will fall. All
therefore who have attempted it were murdered. It was therefore
a point of honour with me to utilize my title of Haji, by entering
this City, visiting its Ruler, and returning in safety, after breaking the
Guardian's spell."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_starts_for_Harar_in_Somali-land"></a>He starts for Harar in Somali-land.</i></div>

<p>This exploration of Harar was one of Richard's most splendid
and dangerous expeditions, and, for some reason or other, the
least known; the reason being, as I think, that his pilgrimage to
Mecca was still making a great noise, and that the Crimean War had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
cropped up, deadening the interest in all <i>personal</i> adventure. He
therefore thought himself fortunate in being able to persuade Lord
Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, to patronize an expedition into
Somali-land.</p>

<p>He was away four months. The journey was useful; at least, it
has proved so to the Egyptians, to the English, and now to the
Italians. He sailed away, leaving Herne, Stroyan, and Speke, each
engaged on his respective work, and arrived at Zayla.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My ship companions," he writes, "were the wildest of the wild, and
as we came into port Zayla a barque came up to give us the bad news.
Friendship between the Amir of Harar and the Governor of Zayla had
been broken; the road through the Eesa Somal had been closed
by the murder of Masúd, a favourite slave and adopted son of Sharmarkay;
all strangers had been expelled the City for some misconduct
by the Harar chief; moreover, small-pox was raging there with
such violence that the Galla peasantry would allow neither ingress nor
egress. The tide was out, and we waded a quarter of a mile amongst
giant crabs, who showed gristly claws, sharp coralline, and seaweed
so thick as to become almost like a mat. In the shallower pacts the
sun was painfully hot even to my well-tried feet. I was taken
immediately to the Governor at Zayla, a fellow Haji, who gave me
hospitality.</p>

<p>"The well-known sounds of El Islam returned from memory.
Again the melodious chant of the <i>muezzin</i>&mdash;no evening bell can
compare with it for solemnity and beauty&mdash;and in the neighbouring
Mosque, the loudly intoned 'Amin' and 'Allaho Akbar,' far superior
to any organ, rang in my ear. The evening gun of camp was represented
by the <i>nakkarah</i>, or kettle-drum, which sounded about seven
p.m. at the southern Gate; and at ten a second drumming warned
the paterfamilias that it was time for home, and thieves and lovers,
that it was the hour for bastinado. Nightfall was ushered in by the
song, the dance, and the marriage festival&mdash;here no permission is
required for 'native music in the lines'&mdash;and muffled figures flitted
mysteriously through the dark alleys.</p>

<p>"After a peep through the open window, I fell asleep, feeling once
more at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Preparations_at_Zayla"></a>Preparations at Zayla.</i></div>

<p>"I was too much of an Arab to weary of the endless preparations
for forming a caravan. I used to provide myself with a Korán
and sit receiving visitors, and would occasionally go into the
Mosque, my servant carrying the prayer carpet, three hundred
pair of eyes staring at me, and after reciting the customary two-bow
prayer, in honour of the Mosque, I would place a sword and
rosary before me, and, taking the Korán, read the cow-chapter,
No. 18, in a loud and twanging voice. This is the character I
adopted. You will bear in mind, if you please, that I am a Moslem
merchant, a character not to be confounded with the notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
individuals seen on ''Change.' Mercator, in the East, is a compound
of tradesmen, divine, and T.G. Usually of gentle birth, he is
everywhere welcomed and respected; and he bears in his mind
and manner that, if Allah please, he may become Prime Minister
a month after he has sold you a yard of cloth. Commerce appears
to be an accident, not an essential, with him, yet he is by no means
deficient in acumen. He is a grave and reverend seignior, with
rosary in hand and Korán on lip; is generally a pilgrim; talks at
dreary length about Holy Places; writes a pretty hand; has read
and can recite much poetry; is master of his religion; demeans
himself with respectability; is perfect in all points of ceremony and
politeness, and feels equally at home whether Sultan or slave sit
upon his counter. He has a wife and children in his own country,
where he intends to spend the remnant of his days; but 'the world
is uncertain'&mdash;'Fate descends, and man's eyes seeth it not'&mdash;'the
earth is a charnel-house;' briefly, his many old saws give him a
kind of theoretical consciousness that his bones may moulder in
other places but his fatherland.</p>

<p>"For half a generation we have been masters of Aden, filling
Southern Arabia with our calicos and rupees&mdash;what is the present
state of affairs there? We are dared by the Bedouins to come forth
from behind our stone walls and fight like men in the plain,&mdash;British
<i>protégés</i> are slaughtered within the range of our guns,&mdash;our
allies' villages have been burned in sight of Aden,&mdash;our deserters are
welcomed and our fugitive felons protected,&mdash;our supplies are cut
off, and the garrison is reduced to extreme distress, at the word of
a half-naked bandit,&mdash;the miscreant Bhagi, who murdered Captain
Mylne in cold blood, still roams the hills unpunished,&mdash;gross insults
are the sole acknowledgements of our peaceful overtures,&mdash;the British
flag has been fired upon without return, our cruisers being ordered to
act only on the defensive,&mdash;and our forbearance to attack is universally
asserted and believed to arise from mere cowardice. Such is,
and such will be, the opinion and the character of the Arab!</p>

<p>"I stayed here for twenty-six days, rising at dawn; then went to
the Terrace to perform my devotions, and make observation of my
neighbours; breakfast at six, then coffee, pipe, and a nap; then
receive visitors, who come by dozens with nothing to do or say.
When they were only Somal, I wrote Arabic, or extracted from some
useful book. When Arabs were there, I would recite tales from the
'Arabian Nights,' to their great delight. At eleven, dinner, more
coffee and pipes; then the natives would go to sleep, and I wrote
my journals and studies. At about two p.m. more visitors would come,
and at sunset again to the Terrace, or walk to a mosque, where
games are going on, or stroll to a camp of Bedawi. The Gates
are locked at sunset, and the keys are carried to the Haji. It is not
safe to be without the City later. Then comes supper.</p>

<p>"After it we repair to the roof to enjoy the prospect of the far
Tajarrah Hills and the white moonbeams sleeping upon the nearer
sea. The evening star hangs like a diamond upon the still horizon;
around the moon a pink zone of light mist, shading off into turquoise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
blue and a delicate green-like chrysopraz, invests the heavens with a
peculiar charm. The scene is truly suggestive; behind us, purpling
in the night air and silvered by the radiance from above, lie the wolds
and mountains tenanted by the fiercest of savages, their shadowy
mysterious forms exciting vague alarms in the traveller's breast.
Sweet as the harp of David, the night-breeze and the music of the
water comes up from the sea; but the ripple and the rustling sound
alternate with the hyæna's laugh, and the jackal's cry, and the wild
dog's lengthened howl.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Desert_Journey"></a>Desert Journey.</i></div>

<p>"This journey, which occupied nearly four months, was to be
through a savage, treacherous, ferocious, and bloodthirsty people,
whose tribes were in a constant state of blood-feud. The party
consisted of nine, an <i>abban</i> or guide, three Arab matchlock men,
two women cooks, who were called Shehrazade and Deenarzade
after the 'Arabian Nights,' a fourth servant, and a Bedawin woman
to drive a donkey, which camels will follow and which is the custom.
We had four or five mules, saddled and bridled, and camels for
the baggage. Every one wept over us, and considered us dead
men. The <i>abban</i> objected to some routes on account of avoiding
tribes with which he had a blood-feud."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was, as I have said, far the most dangerous of Richard's
explorations, quite as difficult as Mecca, and far more difficult than
anything Stanley has ever done, with his advantages of men, money,
and luxuries. The women seemed to be much hardier than the men;
they carried the pipe and tobacco, led the camels, adjusted the
burdens, at the halt unloaded the cattle, disposed the baggage,
covered them with a mat tent, cooked the food, made tea and
coffee, and bivouacked outside the tent.</p>

<p>He writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The air was fresh and clear; and the night breeze was
delicious after the stormy breath of day. The weary confinement
of walls made the weary expanse a luxury to the sight, whilst
the tumbling of the surf upon the near shore, and the music
of the jackal, predisposed to sweet sleep. We now felt that at
length the die was cast. Placing my pistols by my side, with
my rifle butt for a pillow, and its barrel as a bed-fellow, I
sought repose with none of the apprehension which even the most
stout-hearted traveller knows before the start. It is the difference
between fancy and reality, between anxiety and certainty; to men
gifted with any imaginative powers the anticipation must ever be
worse than the event. Thus it happens, that he who feels a thrill
of fear before engaging in a peril, exchanges it for a throb of exultation
when he finds himself hand to hand with the danger."</p></blockquote>

<p>The description of the journey is filled in his notes by being
hindered and almost captured by Bedawi, lamed with thorns, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
camels casting themselves down from fatigue, famishing from hunger,
and, worse, from thirst&mdash;the only water being sulphurous, which
affected both man and beast&mdash;and attacks from lions, sleep being disturbed
by large ants, three-quarters of an inch long, with venomous
stings. Everywhere they went, everybody wept over them, as dead
men. He finds time, nevertheless, to remark, that at the height of
3350 feet he found a buttercup and heard a woodpecker tapping,
that reminded him of home. He describes a sham attack of twelve
Bedawi, who, when they saw what his revolver could do, said they
were only in fun.</p>

<p>At one of the kraals he gives an account of how, being surrounded
by Somals, they were boasting of their shooting, and of the skill with
which they used the shield, but they seemed not to understand the
proper use of the sword.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thinking it was well to impress them with the superiority of
arms, I requested them to put up one of their shields as a mark.
They laughed very much, but would not comply. The Somal hate
a vulture, because it eats the dead and dying; so, seeing a large
brown bare-necked vulture at twenty paces distance, I shot it with
my revolver; then I loaded a gun with swan-shot, which they had
never seen, and, aiming at a bird that they considered far out of
gunshot distance, I knocked it over flying. Fresh screams followed
this marvellous feat, and they said, 'Lo! he bringeth down the
birds from heaven.' Their Chief, putting his forefinger in his mouth,
praised Allah, and prayed to be defended from such a calamity;
and always after, when they saw me approach, they said, 'Here comes
the Shaykh who knows knowledge.' I then gave a stick to the
best man; I provided myself in the same way, and allowed him to
cut at me as much as ever he liked, easily warding off the blows
with a parry. After repeated failures, and tiring himself enormously,
he received a sounding blow from me upon the least bony part of
his person. The crowd laughed long and loud, and the knight-at-arms
retired in confusion.</p>

<p>"Every now and then we got into difficulties with the Bedawi, who
would not allow us to proceed, declaring the land was theirs. We
did not deny the claim, but I threatened sorcery, death, and wild
beasts, and foraging parties to their camels, children, and women.
It generally brought them to their senses. They would spit on us
for good luck, and let us depart. Once a Chief was smitten by
Shehrazade's bulky charms, and wanted to carry her off. Once in
the evening we came upon the fresh trail of a large Habr Awal
cavalcade, which frightened my companions dreadfully. We were
only nine men and two women, to contend against two hundred
horsemen, and all, except the Hammal and Long Guled, would have
run away at the first charge. The worst of the ride was over rough
and stony road, the thorns tearing their feet and naked legs, and the
camels slipping over the rounded pebbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"The joy of coming to a kraal was great, where the Chiefs of the
village appeared, bringing soft speech, sweet water, new milk, fat sheep
and goats, for a <i>tobe</i> of Cutch canvas. We passed a quiet, luxurious
day of coffee and pipes, fresh cream and roasted mutton. After the
great heats and dangers from horsemen on the plain, we enjoyed the
cool breeze of the hills, cloudy skies, and the verdure of the glades
which refreshed our beasts. Here I shot a few hawks, and was
rewarded with loud exclamations of 'Allah preserve thy hand! may
thy skill never fail thee before the foe.' A woman ran away from my
steam kettle, thinking it was a weapon. They looked upon my
sunburnt skin with a favour they denied to the lime-white face.
The Somali Bedawi gradually affiliated me to their tribes.</p>

<p>"At one village the people rushed out, exclaiming, 'Lo! let us look
at the Kings;' at others, 'Come and see the white man; he is the
Governor of Zayla.' My fairness (for, brown as I am, I am fair to
them) and the Arab dress made me sometimes the ruler of Aden,
the Chief of Zayla, the Haji's son, a boy, an old woman, a man
painted white, a warrior in silver armour, a merchant, a pilgrim, a
head priest, Ahmed the Indian, a Turk, an Egyptian, a Frenchman,
a Banyan, a Sheríf, and, lastly, a calamity sent down from heaven
to weary out the lives of the Somal. Every kraal had its own
conjecture.</p>

<p>"On December 9th, I rode a little off my way to visit some ruins,
Darbíyah Kola, or Kola's Fort, so called on account of its Galla
queen. There were once two cities, Aububah, and they fought like
the Kilkenny cats till both were eaten up. This was about three
hundred years ago, and the substantial ruins have fought a stern
fight with Time.</p>

<p>"Remnants of houses cumber the soil, and the carefully built wells
are filled with rubbish. The palace was pointed out to me, with its
walls of stone and clay, intersected by layers of woodwork. The
Mosque is a large, roofless building, containing twelve square pillars
of rude masonry, and the <i>mihrab</i>, or prayer niche, is denoted by a
circular arch of tolerable construction. But the voice of the <i>muezzin</i>
is hushed for ever, and creepers now twine around the ruined fane.
The scene was still and dreary as the grave; for a mile and a half in
length all was ruins&mdash;ruins&mdash;ruins.</p>

<p>"Leaving this Dead City, we rode towards the south-west between
two rugged hills. Topping the ridge, we stood for a few minutes to
observe the view before us. Beneath our feet lay a long grassy
plain&mdash;the sight must have gladdened the hearts of our starving
mules&mdash;and for the first time in Africa horses appeared grazing free
amongst the bushes. A little further off lay the Aylonda Valley,
studded with graves and dark with verdure. Beyond it stretched
the Wady Haráwwah, a long gloomy hollow in the general level.
The background was a bold sweep of blue hill, the second gradient
of the Harar line, and on its summit, closing the western horizon,
lay a golden streak, the Marar Prairie. Already I felt at the end of
my journey.</p>

<p>"It was not an unusual thing in the dusk to see a large animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
following us with quick stealthy strides, and that I, sending a rifle
ball as correctly as I could in the direction, put to flight a large
lion.</p>

<p>"The nearer I got to Harar, the more I was stopped by parties
of Gallas, and some went on to report evil of me, and many threats
were uttered. The 'End of Time' in the last march turned tail.
'Dost thou believe me to be a coward, O Pilgrim?' 'Of a truth
I do,' I answered. Nothing abashed, and with joy at his heart,
he hammered his mule with his heel, and rode off, saying, 'What
hath man but a single life, and he who throweth it away, what is
he but a fool?'"</p></blockquote>

<p>He gives a good account of elephant-hunting, but they did not
get near any. The water was in some places so hard it raised
lumps like nettle-stings, and they had to butter themselves. At one
place the inhabitants flocked out to stare at them. He fired his
rifle by way of salute over the head of the prettiest girl. The people,
delighted, exclaimed, "Mod! Mod! honour to thee!" and he
replied with shouts of "Kulliban! may Heaven aid thee!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When there is any danger a Somali watchman sings and addresses
himself in dialogue, with different voices, to persuade thieves that
several men are watching. Ours was a spectacle of wildness as he
sat before the blazing fire. The 'End of Time' conceived the
jocose idea of crowning me King of the country, with loud cries of
'Buh! Buh! Buh!' while showering leaves from a gum tree and
water from a prayer-bottle over my head, and then with all solemnity
bound on my turban. I was hindered and threatened in no end
of places, and my companions threatened to desert me, saying,
'They will spoil that white skin of thine at Harar.' Still I pushed
on. The Guda Birsi Bedawi number ten thousand spears.</p>

<p>"One night we came upon a sheet of bright blaze, a fire threatening
the whole prairie.</p>

<p>"At last came the sign of leaving the Desert. The scene lifted,
and we came to the second step of the Ethiopian highlands. In
the midst of the valley beneath ran a serpentine of shining waters,
the gladdest spectacle we had yet witnessed. Further in front,
masses of hill rose abruptly from shady valleys, encircled on the
far horizon by a straight blue line of ground resembling a distant sea.
Behind us glared the desert. We had now reached the outskirts of
civilization, where man, abandoning his flocks and herds, settles,
cultivates, and attends to the comforts of life.</p>

<p>"We saw fields, with lanes between, the daisy, the thistle, and
the sweet-briar, settled villages, surrounded by strong <i>abatis</i> of
thorns, which stud the hills everywhere, clumps of trees, to which
the beehives are hung, and yellow crops of holcus, or grain. The
Harvest-Home-song sounded pleasant to my ears, and, contrasting
with the silent desert, the hum of man's habitation was music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
They flocked out to gaze upon us, unarmed, and welcomed us.
We bathed in the waters, on whose banks were a multitude of
huge Mantidæ, pink and tender green. I now had ample time to
see the manners and customs of the settled Somali, as I was conducted
to the cottage of the Gerad's pretty wife, and learned the
home, and the day, and the food. They spoke Harari, Somali, Galla,
Arabic, and dialects. My kettle seems to have created surprise
everywhere.</p>

<p>"Here the last preparations were made for entering this dreadful
City. All my people, and my camels, and most of my goods,
had to be left here for the return journey, and it was the duty
of this Chief (Gerad) to accompany me. I happened to hear
one of them say, 'Of what use is his gun? Before he could
fetch fire I should put this arrow through him.' I wheeled round,
and discharged a barrel over their heads, which threw them into
convulsions of terror. The man I had now to depend upon was
Adan bin Kaushan, a strong wiry Bedawin. He was tricky, ambitious,
greedy of gain, fickle, restless, and treacherous, a cunning idiot,
always so difficult to deal with. His sister was married to the father
of the Amir of Harar, but he said, 'He would as soon walk into a
crocodile's mouth as go into the walls of Harar.' He received a
sword, a Korán, a turban, an Arab waistcoat of gaudy satin, about
seventy <i>tobes</i>, and a similar proportion of indigo-dyed stuff&mdash;he
privily complained to me that the Hammal had given him but
twelve cloths. A list of his wants will best explain the man. He
begged me to bring him from Berberah a silver-hilted sword and
some soap, one thousand dollars, two sets of silver bracelets, twenty
guns with powder and shot, snuff, a scarlet cloth coat embroidered
with gold, some poison that would not fail, and any other little
article of luxury which might be supposed to suit him. In return he
was to present me with horses, mules, slaves, ivory, and other
valuables: he forgot, however, to do so before he departed.</p>

<p>"Whilst we were discussing the project, and getting on satisfactorily,
five strangers well mounted rode in. Two were citizens, and three
were Habr Awal Bedawi, high in the Amir's confidence; they had
been sent to settle blood-money with Adan. They then told him that
I, the Arab, was not one who bought and sold, but a spy; that I and
my party should be sent prisoners to Harar. Adan would not give
us up, falsely promising to present our salaams to the Amir. When
they were gone he told me how afraid he was, and that it was
impossible for him to conduct me to the City. I then relied upon
what has made many a small man Great, my good star and audacity.</p>

<p>"Driven to bay, I wrote an English letter from the Political Agent
at Aden, to the Amir of Harar, intending to deliver it in person; it
was 'neck or nothing.' I only took what was necessary, Sherwa
the son of Adan, the Bedawi Actidon and Mad Said, and left everything
behind me, excepting some presents for the Amir, a change of
clothes, an Arab book or two, a few biscuits, ammunition, and a little
tobacco. I passed through a lovely country, was stopped by the
Gallas, and by the Habr Awal Bedawi, who offered, if we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
wait till sunrise, to take us into the City; so I returned a polite
answer, leading them to expect that I should wait till eight a.m. for
them. I left my journals, sketches, and books in charge of Adan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_enters_the_City_in_Triumph"></a>He enters the City in Triumph.</i></div>

<p>"The journey was hard, and I encountered a Harar Grandee,
mounted upon a handsomely caparisoned mule, and attended by
servants. He was very courteous, and, seeing me thirsty, ordered
me a cup of water. Finally arriving, at the crest of a hill, stood
the City&mdash;the end of my present travel&mdash;a long, sombre line,
strikingly contrasting with the white-washed towns of the East. The
spectacle, materially speaking, was a disappointment; nothing conspicuous
appeared but two grey minarets of rude shape; many would
have grudged exposing three lives to win so paltry a prize. But
of all that have attempted it, none ever succeeded in entering that
pile of stones; the thoroughbred traveller will understand my exultation,
although my two companions exchanged glances of wonder.
Stopping while my companions bathed, I retired to the wayside and
sketched the town. We arrived at three p.m., and advancing to the
gate, Mad Said accosted a warder whom he knew, sent our salaams
to the Amir, saying we came from Aden, and requested the honour
of audience. The Habr Awal collected round me <i>inside</i> the town,
and scowling, inquired why we had not apprised them of our intention
of entering the City; but it was 'war to the knife,' and I did
not deign to answer.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ten Days at Harar&mdash;the Most Exciting Trial of all.</span></h4>


<p>"We were kept waiting half an hour, and were told by the warder
to pass the threshold. Long Guled gave his animal to the two
Bedawi, every one advising my attendants to escape with the
beasts, as we were going to be killed, on the road to this African
St. James. We were ordered to run, but we leisurely led our
mules in spite of the guide's wrath, entered the gate, and strolled
down the yard, which was full of Gallas with spears, and the
waiting gave me an opportunity to inspect the place. I walked into
a vast hall, a hundred feet long, between two long rows of Galla
spearmen, between whose lines I had to pass. They were large
half-naked savages, standing like statues, with fierce movable eyes,
each one holding, with its butt end on the ground, a huge spear, with
a head the size of a shovel. I purposely sauntered down them
coolly with a swagger, with my eyes fixed upon their dangerous-looking
faces. I had a six-shooter concealed in my waist-belt, and
determined, at the first show of excitement, to run up to the Amir,
and put it to his head, if it were necessary, to save my own life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Interview_with_the_Amir"></a>Interview with the Amir.</i></div>

<p>"The Amir was like a little Indian Rajah, an etiolated youth about
twenty-four or twenty-five years old, plain, thin bearded, with a
yellow complexion, wrinkled brows, and protruding eyes. His dress
was a flowing robe of crimson cloth, edged with snowy fur, and a
narrow white turban tightly twisted round a tall conical cap of red
velvet, like the old Turkish headgear of our painters. His throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
was a common Indian <i>kursi</i>, or raised cot, about five feet long, with
back and sides supported by a dwarf railing; being an invalid, he
rested his elbow upon a pillow, under which appeared the hilt of a
Cutch sabre. Ranged in double line, perpendicular to the Amir,
stood the 'Court,' his cousins and nearest relations, with right arms
bared after the fashion of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>"I entered this second avenue of Galla spearsmen with a loud
'Peace be upon ye!' to which H.H. replying graciously, and
extending a hand, bony and yellow as a kite's claw, snapped his
thumb and middle finger. Two chamberlains stepping forward,
held my forearms, and assisted me to bend low over the fingers,
which, however, I did not kiss, being naturally averse to performing
that operation upon any but a woman's hand. My two servants
then took their turn: in this case, after the back was saluted, the
palm was presented for a repetition.<a name="FNanchor_1_82" id="FNanchor_1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_82" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These preliminaries concluded,
we were led to, and seated upon a mat in front of the Amir,
who directed towards us a frowning brow and an inquisitive eye.</p>

<p>"I made some inquiries about the Amir's health: he shook his
head captiously, and inquired our errand. I drew from my pocket
my own letter: it was carried by a chamberlain, with hands veiled
in his <i>tobe</i>, to the Amir, who, after a brief glance, laid it upon the
couch, and demanded further explanation. I then represented in
Arabic that we had come from Aden, bearing the compliments of
our <i>Daulah</i>, or Governor, and that we had entered Harar to see the
light of H.H.'s countenance: this information concluded with a little
speech describing the changes of Political Agents in Arabia, and
alluding to the friendship formerly existing between the English and
the deceased Chief Abubakr.</p>

<p>"The Amir smiled graciously.</p>

<p>"This smile, I must own, was a relief. We had been prepared for
the worst, and the aspect of affairs in the Palace was by no means
reassuring.</p>

<p>"Whispering to his Treasurer, a little ugly man with a baldly shaven
head, coarse features, pug nose, angry eyes, and stubbly beard, the
Amir made a sign for us to retire. The <i>baisé main</i> was repeated, and
we backed out of the audience-shed in high favour. According to
grandiloquent Bruce, 'the Court of London and that of Abyssinia
are, in their principles, one;' the loiterers in the Harar palace-yard,
who had before regarded us with cut-throat looks, now smiled as
though they loved us. Marshalled by the guard, we issued from the
precincts, and, after walking a hundred yards, entered the Amir's
second palace, which we were told to consider our home. There we
found the Bedawi, who, scarcely believing that we had escaped
alive, grinned in the joy of their hearts, and we were at once provided
from the Chief's kitchen with a dish of <i>shabta</i>, holcus cakes soaked in
sour milk, and thickly powdered with red pepper, the salt of this
inland region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"When we had eaten, the Treasurer reappeared, bearing the Amir's
command that we should call upon his Wazir, the Gerad Mohammad.
We found a venerable old man, whose benevolent countenance
belied the reports current about him in Somali-land. Half rising,
although his wrinkled brow showed suffering, he seated me by his
side upon the carpeted masonry-bench, where lay the implements
of his craft&mdash;reeds, inkstands, and whitewashed boards for paper&mdash;politely
welcomed me, and, gravely stroking his cotton-coloured
beard, desired to know my object in good Arabic.</p>

<p>"I replied almost in the words used to the Amir, adding, however,
some details, how in the old day one Madar Faríh had been charged
by the late Sultan Abubakr with a present to the Governor of Aden,
and that it was the wish of our people to re-establish friendly
relations and commercial intercourse with Harar.</p>

<p>"'Khayr Inshallah! it is well, if Allah please!' ejaculated the
Gerad. I then bent over his hand, and took leave.</p>

<p>"Returning, we inquired anxiously of the Treasurer about my
servants' arms, which had not been returned, and were assured that
they had been placed in the safest of storehouses, the Palace. I
then sent a common six-barrelled revolver as a present to the Amir,
explaining its use to the bearer, and we prepared to make ourselves
as comfortable as possible. The interior of our new house was
a clean room, with plain walls, and a floor of tamped earth; opposite
the entrance were two broad steps of masonry, raised about two
feet, and a yard above the ground, and covered with hard matting.
I contrived to make upon the higher ledge a bed with the cushions
which my companions used as <i>shabracques</i>, and after seeing the
mules fed and tethered, lay down to rest, worn out by fatigue and
profoundly impressed with the <i>poésie</i> of our position. I was under
the roof of a bigoted prince whose least word was death; amongst
a people who detest foreigners; the only European that had ever
passed over their inhospitable threshold; and, more than that, I was
<i>the fated instrument of their future downfall</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>He gives a very detailed account of the City of Harar, its inhabitants,
and all he saw during his ten days there, for which I refer
people to "First Footsteps in East Africa," one large volume,

<p>"The explorer must frequently rest satisfied with descrying from
his Pisgah, the knowledge which another more fortunate is destined
to acquire. <i>Inside</i> Harar, I was so closely watched, that it was
impossible to put pen to paper. It was only when I got back to
Wilensi that I hastily collected the grammatical forms, and a
vocabulary which proves that the language is not Arabic; that it
<i>has</i> an affinity with the Amharic. Harar has its own tongue, unintelligible
to any save the citizens. Its little population of eight
thousand souls is a distinct race. A common proverb is, 'Hard as
the heart of Harar.' They are extremely bigoted, especially against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Christians, and are fond of a religious war, or <i>jehád</i>, with the Gallas.
They hold foreigners in hate and contempt, and divide them into
two classes, Arabs and Somal.</p>

<p>"The Somals say that the State dungeon is beneath the palace,
and that he who once enters it lives with unkempt beard and
untrimmed nails till the day when death sets him free. There is
nothing more terrible; the captive is heavily ironed, lies in a filthy
dungeon, and receives no food, except what he can obtain from
his own family, or buy or beg from his guards. The Amir has
bad health; I considered him consumptive. It is something in
my favour that, as soon as I departed, he wrote to the acting
Political Resident at Aden, earnestly begging to be supplied with
a Frank physician, and offering protection to any European who
might be persuaded to visit his dominions. His rule was severe,
if not just, and it has all the prestige of secrecy. Even the Gerad
Mohammad, even the Queen Dowager, are threatened with fetters
if they offer uncalled-for advice. His principal occupation is spying
his many stalwart cousins, indulging in vain fears of the English
and the Turks, amassing treasure by commerce and cheating.</p>

<p>"The Amir Ahmed is alive to the fact that some State should
hedge in a Prince. Neither weapons nor rosaries are allowed in
his presence; a chamberlain's robe acts as spittoon; whenever
anything is given to or taken from him his hand must be kissed;
even on horseback two attendants fan him with the hems of their
garments. Except when engaged on the Haronic visits, which he,
like his father, pays to the streets and byways at night, he is always
surrounded by a strong body-guard. He rides to Mosque escorted
by a dozen horsemen, and a score of footmen with guns and whips
precede him; by his side walks an officer, shading him with a huge
and heavily fringed red-satin umbrella&mdash;from India to Abyssinia the
sign of princely dignity. Even at his prayers, two or three chosen
matchlockmen stand over him with lighted fusees. When he rides
forth in public, he is escorted by a party of fifty men; the running
footmen crack their whips and shout, 'Let! Let!' (Go! go!), and
the citizens avoid stripes by retreating into the nearest house, or
running into another street.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Has_Great_Success"></a>Has Great Success.</i></div>

<p>"Immediately on our arrival we were called upon by all sorts of
Arabs; they were very civil to me at first, but when the Amir
ceased to send for me, just as at civilized Courts, they prudently
cut me. The moment the Amir sent for me, my Habr Awal
enemies, seeing the tide of fortune setting in my favour, changed
their tactics, and proposed themselves as my escort to return to
Berberah, which I politely refused. They did me all the harm they
could, but my good star triumphed. After one day's rest, I was
summoned to wait upon the Gerad Mohammad, who was Prime
Minister. Sword in hand, and, followed by my two attendants, I
walked to the Palace, and found him surrounded by six counsellors;
they were eating <i>jat</i>, which has somewhat the effect of hashish.</p>

<p>"He sat me by his right hand on the dais, where I ate <i>jat</i>, being,
fortunately, used to these things, and fingered the rosary. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
followed prayer, and then a theological discussion, in which, fortunately,
I was able to distinguish myself. My theology won general
approbation and kind glances from the elders. In a very short
time I was sent for by the Amir, and this time was allowed to
approach the outer door with covered feet. I entered as ceremoniously
as before, and the prince motioned me to sit near the
Gerad, on a Persian rug to the right of the throne; my attendants
on humble mats at a greater distance. After sundry inquiries of
what was going on at Aden, the Resident's letter was suddenly produced
by the Amir, who bade me explain its contents, and wished
to know if it was my intention to buy and sell at Harar. I replied,
'We are neither buyers nor sellers; we have become your guests to
pay our respects to the Amir, who may Allah preserve, and that
the friendship between the two Powers may endure.' The Amir was
pleased, and I therefore ventured to hope that the Prince would
soon permit me to return, as the air of Harar was too dry for me,
and that we were in danger of small-pox, then raging in the town,
and through the Gerad, the Amir said, 'The reply will be vouchsafed,'
and the interview was over.</p>

<p>"I sent my salaam to one of the Ulema, Shaykh Jámi; he accepted
the excuse of health and came to see me. He was remarkably well
read in the religious sciences, and a great man at Mecca, with much
influence with the Sultan, and employed on political Missions amongst
the Chiefs. He started with the intention of winning the Crown of
Glory by murdering the British Resident at Aden, but he was so
struck with the order of justice of our rule, he offered El Islam
to that officer, who received it so urbanely, that the simple Eastern,
instead of cutting the Kaffir's throat, began to pray fervently for his
conversion. We were kindly looked upon by a sick and decrepid
eunuch, named Sultán. I used to spend my evenings preaching to
the Gallas.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Damaging_Reports"></a>Damaging Reports.</i></div>

<p>"The Gerad Mohammad was now worked upon by the Habr
Awal, my enemies, to make inquiries about me, and one of the
Ayyal Gedíd clan came up and reported that three brothers<a name="FNanchor_2_83" id="FNanchor_2_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_83" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> had
landed in the Somal country, that two of them were anxiously
waiting at Berberah the return of the fourth from Harar, and that,
though dressed like Moslems, they were really English spies in
Government employ, and orders were issued for cutting off Caravans.
We, however, were summoned to the Gerad's, where, fortunately for
me, I found him suffering badly from bronchitis. I saw my chance.
I related to him all its symptoms, and told him that if I could only
get down to Aden, I could send him all the right remedies, with
directions. He clung to the hope of escaping his sufferings, and
begged me to lose no time. Presently the Amir sent for him, and
in a few minutes I was sent for alone. A long conversation ensued
about the state of Aden, of Zayla, of Berberah, and of Stamboul.
The Chief put a variety of questions about Arabia, and every object
there; the answer was that the necessity of commerce, confined us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to the gloomy rock Aden. He used some obliging expressions about
desiring our friendship, and having considerable respect for a people
who built, he understood, large ships. I took the opportunity of
praising Harar in cautious phrase, and especially of regretting that
its coffee was not better known amongst the Franks. The small
wizen-faced man smiled, as Moslems say, the smile of Umar;<a name="FNanchor_3_84" id="FNanchor_3_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_84" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> seeing
his brow relax for the first time, I told him that, being now restored
to health, we requested his commands for Aden. He signified consent
with a nod, and the Gerad, with many compliments, gave me
a letter addressed to the Political Resident, and requested me to
take charge of a mule as a present. I then arose, recited a short
prayer, the gist of which was that the Amir's days and reign might
be long in the land, and that the faces of his foes might be blackened
here and hereafter, bent over his hand, and retired. Returning to
the Gerad's levée-hut, I saw by the countenances of my two attendants
that they were not a little anxious about the interview, and
comforted them with the whispered word, 'Achha!' (all right!)</p>

<p>"Presently appeared the Gerad, accompanied by two men, who
brought my servants' arms, and the revolver which I had sent to
the prince. This was a <i>contretemps</i>. It was clearly impossible
to take back the present; besides which, I suspected some <i>finesse</i>
to discover my feelings towards him. The other course would ensure
delay. I told the Gerad that the weapon was intended especially to
preserve the Amir's life, and, for further effect, snapped caps in rapid
succession, to the infinite terror of the august company. The Minister
returned to his Master, and soon brought back the information that,
after a day or two, another mule should be given to me. With
suitable acknowledgments we arose, blessed the Gerad, bade adieu
to the assembly, and departed joyful; the Hammal, in his glee,
speaking broken English, even in the Amir's courtyard.</p>

<p>"Shaykh Jámi was rendered joyful by the news he told me when
I arrived; he had been informed that in the Town was a man who
had brought down the birds from heaven, and the citizens had
been thrown into a great excitement by my probable intentions.
One of the principal Ulema, and a distinguished Haji, had been
dreaming dreams in my favour, and sent their salaams. My long
residence in the East had made me grateful to the learned, whose
influence over the people, when unbiased by bigotry, is for the good.
On January 11th, I was sent for by the Gerad, and given the second
mule; he begged me not to forget his remedies as soon as I reached
Aden, and I told him that I would start on the morrow. I scarcely
had got in, when there were heavy showers and thunder. When I
got up to mount early on Friday morning, of course a mule had
strayed; then Shaykh Jámi would not go till Monday. Now, as
I had been absent from my goods and chattels a whole fortnight,
as the people at Harar are immensely fickle, as you never know the
moment that the Amir may change his mind, for all African Cities
are prisons on a large scale&mdash;you enter by your own will, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
leave by another's&mdash;I longed to start; however, the storms warned
me to be patient, and I deterred my departure till next morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_leaves_Harar_safely"></a>He leaves Harar safely.</i></div>

<p>"Long before dawn on Saturday, January 13th, the mules were
saddled, bridled, and charged with our scanty luggage. After a
hasty breakfast we shook hands with old Sultán, the eunuch,
mounted and pricked through the desert streets. Suddenly my
weakness and sickness left me&mdash;so potent a drug is joy&mdash;and, as
we passed the Gates, loudly salaaming to the warders, who were
crouching over the fire inside, a weight of care and anxiety fell
from me like a cloak of lead.</p>

<p>"Yet I had time, on the top of my mule, for musing upon how
melancholy a thing is Success. Whilst failure inspirits a man,
attainment reads the sad prosy lesson that all our glories</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Are shadows, not substantial things.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>Truly said the <i>sayer</i>, 'Disappointment is the salt of life'&mdash;a salutary
bitter which strengthens the mind for fresh exertion, and gives a
double value to the prize.</p>

<p>"This shade of melancholy soon passed away. We made in a
direct line for Kondura. At one p.m. we safely threaded the Gallas'
pass, and about an hour afterwards we exclaimed, 'Alhamdulillah,'
at the sight of Sagharrah and the distant Marar Prairie. Entering
the village, we discharged our firearms. The men gave cordial
<i>poignées de mains</i>&mdash;some danced with joy to see us return alive; they
had heard of our being imprisoned, bastinadoed, slaughtered; they
swore that the Gerad was raising an army to rescue or revenge us&mdash;in
fact, had we been their kinsmen, more excitement could not have
been displayed. Lastly, in true humility, crept forward the "End of
Time," who, as he kissed my hand, was upon the point of tears.</p>

<p>"A pleasant evening was spent in recounting our perils, as
travellers will do, and complimenting one another upon the power
of our star.</p>

<p>"At eight next morning we rode to Wilensi, and as we approached,
all the villagers and wayfarers inquired if we were the party that had
been put to death by the Amir of Harar.</p>

<p>"Loud congratulations and shouts of joy awaited our arrival.
The Kalendar was in a paroxysm of delight; both Shehrazade and
Deenarzade were affected with giggling and what might be blushing.
We reviewed our property and found that the One-eyed had been a
faithful steward, so faithful indeed that he had wellnigh starved
the two women. Presently appeared the Gerad and his sons,
bringing with them my books; the former was at once invested
with a gaudy Abyssinian <i>tobe</i> of many colours, in which he sallied
forth from the cottage the admired of all admirers. The pretty
wife, Sudíyah, and the good Khayrah were made happy by sundry
gifts of huge Birmingham ear-rings, brooches and bracelets, scissors,
needles, and thread. The evening as usual ended in a feast.</p>

<p>"We were obliged to halt a week at Wilensi to feed, for both
man and beast to lay in a stock of strength for the long desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
march before us, to buy onions, tobacco, spices, wooden platters,
and a sort of bread called <i>karanji</i>. Here I made my grammar and
vocabulary of the Harari tongue, under the supervision of Mad Said
and Ali the poet, a Somali educated at Harar, who knew Arabic,
Somali, Galla, and Harar languages.</p>

<p>"On January 21st I wanted to start, but Shaykh Jámi appeared
with all the incurables of the country. Nobody can form an idea
of the difficulties that an Eastern will put in your way when you
want to start, and unfortunately in nine cases out of ten the ruses
they have resort to, <i>do</i> prevent your starting. Now, in this case,
I decided that talismans were the best and safest medicines in
these mountains. The Shaykh doubted them, but when I exhibited
my diploma as a Master-Sufi, a new light broke in upon him and
his attendants. 'Verily he hath declared himself this day!' whispered
each to his neighbour, sorely mystified. Shaykh Jámi carefully
inspected the document, raised it reverently to his forehead, muttered
prayers, and owned himself my pupil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Fearful_Desert_Journey"></a>A Fearful Desert Journey.</i></div>

<p>"Now, however, all my followers had got some reason why they
could not go, so I sauntered out alone, attended only by the
Hammal, and, in spite of the Chief summoning me to halt, I took
an abrupt leave and went off, and entered the Marar Prairie with
pleasure. The truants joined us later on, and we met a party
whose Chief, a Somali, expressed astonishment at our escaping from
Harar, told us that the Berberi were incensed with us for leaving
the direct road, advised us to push on that night, to 'ware the bush,
whence the Midjans would use their poisoned arrows. The Berberi
had offered a hundred cows for our person dead or alive. Then
my party sat down to debate; they palavered for three hours. They
said that the camels could not walk, that the cold of the prairies
was death to man, till darkness came on. Experience had taught
me that it was waste of time to debate overnight about dangers
to be faced next day, so I ate my dates, drank my milk, and lay
down to enjoy sweet sleep in the tranquil silence of the desert.
Although I did not know it till after my return from Berberah,
Gerad Adan was my greatest danger. If his plotting had succeeded
it would have cost him dear, but would also have proved fatal to me.
The 23rd of January passed in the same manner, and the explanation
I had with my men was, that on the morrow at dawn I would
cross the Marar Prairie by myself; and we started at dawn on the
24th, giving a wide berth to the Berberis, whose camp-fires were quite
visible at a distance. As we were about to enter the lands of the
Habr Awal, our enemies, a week would elapse before we could get
protection. We had resolved to reach the coast within the fortnight,
instead of which a month's march was in prospect. Suddenly Beuh
appeared, and I proposed to him that he should escort the Caravans
to Zayla, and that I and the two others who had accompanied me to
Harar would mount our mules, only carrying arms and provisions for
four days. I pushed through the land of our enemies the Habr Awal.
In the land we were to traverse every man's spear would be against
us, so I chose the desert roads, and carefully avoided all the kraals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
It was with serious apprehension that I pocketed all my remaining
provisions&mdash;five biscuits, a few limes, a few lumps of sugar. Any
accident to our mules, any delay would starve us; we were traversing
a desert where no one would sell us meat or milk, and only one
water-bottle in the whole party.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Want_of_Water"></a>Want of Water.</i></div>

<p>"We rode thirty-five miles over awful tracks. Our toil was
rendered doubly dreadful by the Eastern traveller's dread&mdash;the
demon of Thirst rode like Care behind us&mdash;for twenty-four hours
we did not taste water, the sun parched our brains, the mirage
mocked us at every turn, and the effect was a species of monomania.
As I jogged along with eyes closed against the fiery air, no image
unconnected with the want suggested itself. Water ever lay before
me, water lying deep in the shady well, water in streams bubbling
icy from the rock, water in pellucid lakes inviting me to plunge and
revel in their treasures. Now an Indian cloud was showering upon
me fluid more precious than molten pearl, then an invisible hand
offered a bowl for which the mortal part would gladly have
bartered years of life. Then&mdash;drear contrast!&mdash;I opened my eyes
to a heat-reeking plain, and a sky of that eternal metallic blue so
lovely to painter and poet, so blank and death-like to us, whose
χαλον [Greek: chalon] was tempest, rain-storm, and the huge purple nimbus. I
tried to talk&mdash;it was in vain; to sing&mdash;in vain; vainly to think;
every idea was bound up in one subject&mdash;water.<a name="FNanchor_4_85" id="FNanchor_4_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_85" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"As a rule, twelve hours without water in the desert during hot
weather kill a man. We had another frightful journey to the next
water. I never suffered severely from thirst but on this expedition;
probably it was in consequence of being at the time but in weak
health so soon after Mecca. A few more hours and the little party
would have been food for the desert beasts. We were saved by
a bird. When we had been thirty-six hours without water we
could go no further, and we were prepared to die the worst of all
deaths. The short twilight of the tropics was drawing in, I looked
up and saw a <i>katta</i>, or sand-grouse, with its pigeon-like flight,
making for the nearer hills. These birds must drink at least once
a day, and generally towards evening, when they are safe to carry
water in their bills to their young. I cried out, 'See, the <i>katta</i>!
the <i>katta</i>!' All revived at once, took heart, and followed the bird,
which suddenly plunged down about a hundred yards away, showing
us a charming spring, a little shaft of water, about two feet in
diameter, in a margin of green. We jumped from our saddles, and
men and beasts plunged their heads into the water and drank till
they could drink no more. I have never since shot a <i>katta</i>.</p>

<p>"With unspeakable delight, after another thirty hours, we saw in
the distance a patch of lively green: our animals scented the blessing
from afar, they raised their drooping ears, and started with us at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
a canter, till, turning a corner, we suddenly sighted sundry little
wells. To spring from the saddle, to race with our mules, who now
feared not the crumbling sides of the pits, to throw ourselves into
the muddy pools, to drink a long slow draught, and to dash the
water over our burning faces, took less time to do than to recount.
A calmer inspection showed a necessity for caution; the surface was
alive with tadpoles and insects: prudence, however, had little power
at that time&mdash;we drank, and drank, and then drank again. As our
mules had fallen with avidity upon the grass, I proposed to pass
a few hours near the wells. My companions, however, pleading the
old fear of lions, led the way before dark to a deserted kraal upon a
neighbouring hill. We had marched this time about thirty hours
<i>eastward</i>, and had entered a safe country belonging to the Bahgoba,
our guide's clan.</p>

<p>"There is nothing so dreadful as crossing a country full of blocks
and boulders piled upon one another in rugged steps, and it was
such a ravine, the Splügen of Somali-land, that we had to dismount.
To a laden camel it is almost impossible; the best-fed horses, mules,
or asses, having to perform the work of goats instead of their own,
are worn out by it after a few hours; and this was what I and my
party had to do, and often the boulders were covered with thorns
two inches long, tipped with wooden points as sharp as a needle.
After three days of hard travelling in this way we saw the face
of man&mdash;some shepherds, who fled at our approach. We then
followed an undulating growth of parched grass, shaping our
course for Jebel Almis, to sailors the chief landmark of this coast,
and for a certain thin blue stripe on the far horizon,&mdash;the sea,&mdash;upon
which we gazed with gladdened eyes. That night we
arrived at a kraal, unsaddled, and began to make ourselves comfortable,
when we found we had fallen upon the Ayyal Shirdon,
our bitterest enemies. They asked, 'What tribe be ye?' I boldly
answered, 'Of Habr Gerhagis.' Thereupon ensued a war of words;
they rudely insisted on knowing what had taken us to Harar,
when a warrior armed with two spears came forward, recognized
the 'End of Time,' and they retired but spoke of fighting. So
we made ready with our weapons and bade them come on; but
while they were considering, we saddled our mules and rode off.
We stopped at three villages, and the Hammal failed to obtain even
a drop of water from his relations. It was most distressful, as men
and beasts were faint from thirst, so I determined to push forward
for water that night. Many times the animals stopped,&mdash;a mute hint
that they could go no further;&mdash;but <i>I</i> pushed on, and the rest had
learned to follow without a word. The moon arose, and still we
tottered on. About midnight&mdash;delightful sound!&mdash;the murmur of
the distant sea. Revived by the music, we pushed on more cheerily.
At three in the morning we found some holes which supplied us
with bitter water, truly delicious after fifteen hours' thirst. Repeated
draughts of this element, and coarse stubbly grass, saved us and our
mules. Rain came on, but we slept like the dead. At six, we
resumed our march, going slowly along the seacoast, and at noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
we were able to sit on the sands and bathe in the sea. Our beasts
could hardly move, and slippery mud added to their troubles.
At three p.m. we again got a patch of grass, and halted the animals
to feed; and a mile further some wells, where we again rested them,
watered them, finished our last mouthful of food, and prepared for
a long night march.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="They_reach_Berberah_Join_Speke_Herne_Stroyan"></a>They reach Berberah&mdash;Join Speke, Herne, Stroyan.</i></div>

<p>"We managed to pass all our enemies in the dark, and they cursed
the star that had enabled us to slip unhurt through their hands.
I was obliged to call a halt within four miles of Berberah; the
animals could not move, neither could the men, except the Hammal
and I, and they all fell fast asleep on the stones. As soon as we could
go on, a long dark line appeared upon the sandy horizon, the silhouettes
of shipping showing against sea and sky. A cry of joy burst
from every mouth. 'Cheer, boys, cheer! our toils here touch their
end.' The 'End of Time' still whispered anxiously lest enemies
might arise; we wound slowly and cautiously round the southern
portion of the sleeping town, through bone-heaps, and jackals tearing
their unsavoury prey, straight into the quarter of the Ayyal Gedíd,
our protectors. Anxiously I inquired if my comrades had left
Berberah, and heard with delight that they were there. It was two
o'clock in the morning, and we had marched forty miles.</p>

<p>"I dismounted at the huts where my comrades were living. A
glad welcome, a dish of rice, and a glass of strong waters made
amends for past privations and fatigue. The servants and the
wretched mules were duly provided for, and I fell asleep, conscious
of having performed a feat which, like a certain ride to York, will
live in local annals for many and many a year.</p>

<p>"Great fatigue is seldom followed by long sleep. Soon after
sunrise I woke, hearing loud voices, seeing masses of black faces, and
tawny wigs. The Berberah people, who had been informed of our
five-day ride, swore that the thing was impossible, that we <i>had</i> never,
<i>could</i> never have been near Harar, but were astonished when they
found it was true. I then proceeded to inspect my attendants and
cattle. The former were delighted, having acquitted themselves of
their trust; the poor mules were by no means so easily restored.
Their backs were cut to the bone by the saddle, their heads drooped
sadly, their hams showed dread marks of the spear-point. I directed
them to be washed in the sea, to be dressed with cold-water bandages,
and copiously fed. Through a broad gap, called Duss Malablay,
appear in fine weather the granite walls of Wagar and Gulays,
5700 feet above the level of the sea. Lieutenant Herne found
it would make an admirable sanitarium. The emporium of Eastern
Africa has a salubrious climate, abundance of sweet water, a mild
monsoon, a fine open country, an excellent harbour, a highly productive
soil, is the meeting-place of commerce, has few rivals, and
for half the money wasted on Aden, might have been covered with
houses, gardens, and trees. My companions and I, after a day's
rest, made some excursions. We had a few difficulties about our
<i>Abans</i>, or protectors. We did not choose to be dictated to, so there
was a general council of the elders. It took place upon the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
each Chief forming a semicircle with his followers, all squatting on
the sand, with shield and spear planted upright in the ground. I
entered the circle sword in hand, and sat down in their midst.
After much murmuring had gone on the Chief asked, in a loud
voice, 'Who is thy protector?' The reply was, 'Burhale Nuh,'
followed by an Arabic speech as long as an average sermon, and then,
shouldering my blade, I left the circle abruptly. It was a success;
they held a peace conference, and the olive waved over the braves
of Berberah. On the 5th of February, 1855, I left my comrades <i>pro
tem.</i>, and went on board <i>El Kásab</i>, or the Reed, the ill-omened
name of our cranky craft, and took with me the Hammal, Long
Guled, and the 'End of Time,' who were in danger, and rejoiced at
leaving Berberah with sound skins. I met with opposition at landing.
I could not risk a quarrel so near Berberah, and was returning
to moralize on the fate of Burckhardt&mdash;after a successful pilgrimage
refused admittance to Aaron's tomb at Sinai&mdash;when a Bedawin ran
to tell us that we might wander where we pleased.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_sails_for_Aden"></a>He sails for Aden.</i></div>

<p>"The captain of the <i>Reed</i> drew off a great deal further than I
ordered, and when I went down to go on board, the vessel was a
mere speck upon the sea horizon. He managed to cast anchor at
last, after driving his crazy craft through a bad sea. I stood on the
shore making signs for a canoe, but he did not choose to see me till
about one p.m. As soon as I found myself on quarter-deck&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Dawwír el farmán!' (Shift the yard!) I shouted, with a voice
of thunder.</p>

<p>"The answer was a general hubbub. 'He surely will not sail in a
sea like this?' asked the trembling captain of my companions.</p>

<p>"'He will!' sententiously quoth the Hammal, with a Burleigh nod.</p>

<p>"'It blows wind,' remonstrated the <i>rais</i>.</p>

<p>"'And if it blew fire?' asked the Hammal, with the air <i>goguenard</i>,
meaning that from the calamity of Frankish obstinacy there was no
refuge.</p>

<p>"A kind of death-wail rose, during which, to hide untimely
laughter, I retreated to a large drawer in the stern of the vessel,
called a cabin. There my ears could distinguish the loud entreaties
of the crew, vainly urging my attendants to propose a day's delay.
Then one of the garrison, accompanied by the Captain, who shook
as with fever, resolved to act forlorn hope, and bring a <i>feu d'enfer</i> of
phrases to bear upon the Frank's hard brain. Scarcely, however, had
the head of the sentence been delivered, before he was playfully
upraised by his bushy hair and a handle somewhat more substantial,
carried out of the cabin, and thrown, like a bag of biscuit, on the
deck.</p>

<p>"The case was hopeless. All strangers plunged into the sea&mdash;the
popular way of landing in East Africa&mdash;the anchor was weighed,
the ton of sail shaken out, and the <i>Reed</i> began to dip and rise in
the yeasty sea laboriously, as an alderman dancing a polka.</p>

<p>"For the first time in my life I had the satisfaction of seeing the
Somal unable to eat&mdash;unable to eat mutton!! In sea-sickness and
needless terror, the Captain, crew, and passengers abandoned to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
all the baked sheep, which we three, not being believers in the Evil
Eye, ate from head to trotters with especial pleasure. That night
the waves broke over us. The 'End of Time' occupied himself in
roaring certain orisons which are reputed to calm stormy seas; he
desisted only when Long Guled pointed out that a wilder gust seemed
to follow, as in derision, each more emphatic period. The Captain, a
noted reprobate, renowned on shore for his knowledge of erotic verse
and admiration of the fair sex, prayed with fervour; he was joined
by several of the crew, who apparently found the charm of novelty
in the edifying exercise. About midnight a <i>sultan el bahr</i>, or sea-King&mdash;a
species of whale&mdash;appeared close to our counter; and
as these animals are famous for upsetting vessels in waggishness,
the sight elicited a yell of terror, and a chorus of religious
exclamations.</p>

<p>"On the morning of Friday, the 9th of February, 1855, we hove
in sight of Jebel Shamsan, the loftiest peak on the Aden crater.
And ere evening fell, I had the pleasure of seeing the faces of
friends and comrades once more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Returns_with_Forty_Men"></a>Returns with Forty Men.</i></div>

<p>"If I had 'let well alone,' I should have done well; but I
wanted to make a new expedition Nile-wards, <i>viâ</i> Harar, on a
larger and more imposing scale. For that I went back to Aden.
On April 7th, 1855, I returned successful. Lieutenant King,
Indian Navy, commanded the gunboat <i>Mahi</i>, and entered the
harbour of Berberah with us on board. I was in command
of a party of forty-two men, armed, and we established an agency,
and selected the site of our camp in a place where we could have
the protection of the gunboat; but the Commander of the schooner
had orders to relieve another ship, and so could not remain and
superintend the departure of the Expedition. It was the time after
the Fair, and one might say that Berberah was empty, and that there
was scarcely any one but ourselves. Our tents were pitched in one
line&mdash;Stroyan's to the right, Herne and myself in the middle, and
Speke on the left. The baggage was placed between our tents, the
camels were in front, the horses and mules behind us. Two sentries
all night were regularly relieved and visited by ourselves. We were
very well received, and they listened with respectful attention to a
letter, in which the Political Resident at Aden enjoined them to
treat us with consideration and hospitality. We had purchased
fifty-six camels; Ogadayn Caravan was anxious for our escort. If
we had departed then, perhaps all would have been well; but we
expected instruments and other necessaries by the mid-April mail
from Europe. Three days afterwards, a craft from Aden came in
with a dozen Somals, who wanted to accompany us, and fortunately
I feasted the Commander and the crew, which caused them to remain.
We little knew that our lives hung upon a thread, and that had the
vessel departed, as she would otherwise have done, the night before
the attack, nothing could have saved us. Between two and three
a.m. of April 19th, there was a cry that the enemy was upon us,
three hundred and fifty strong. Hearing a rush of men, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
stormy wind, I sprang up, and called for my sabre, and sent
Herne to ascertain the force of the foray. Armed with a 'Colt,' he
went to the rear and left of the camp, the direction of danger,
collecting some of the guards&mdash;others having already disappeared&mdash;and
fired two shots into the assailants. Then finding himself alone,
he turned hastily towards the tent; in so doing, he was tripped up by
the ropes, and, as he arose, a Somali appeared in the act of striking
at him with a club. Herne fired, floored the man, and, rejoining me,
declared that the enemy was in great force and the guard nowhere.
Meanwhile, I had aroused Stroyan and Speke, who were sleeping in
the extreme right and left tents. The former, it is presumed, arose
to defend himself, but, as the sequel shows, we never saw him alive.
Speke, awakened by the report of firearms, but supposing it to be the
normal false alarm&mdash;a warning to plunderers&mdash;remained where he
was; presently, hearing clubs rattling upon his tent, and feet shuffling
around, he ran to my <i>rowtie</i>, which we prepared to defend as long
as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="They_are_attacked_A_Desperate_Fight"></a>They are attacked&mdash;A Desperate Fight.</i></div>

<p>"The enemy swarmed like hornets, with shouts and screams, intending
to terrify, and proving that overwhelming odds were against us.
It was by no means easy to avoid in the shades of night the jobbing
of javelins, and the long, heavy daggers thrown at our legs from
under and through the opening of the tent. We three remained
together; Herne knelt by my right, on my left was Speke guarding
the entrance, I stood in the centre, having nothing but a sabre.
The revolvers were used by my companions with deadly effect;
unfortunately there was but one pair. When the fire was exhausted,
Herne went to search for his powder-horn, and, that failing, to find
some spears usually tied to the tent-pole. Whilst thus engaged,
he saw a man breaking into the rear of our <i>rowtie</i>, and came back
to inform me of the circumstance.</p>

<p>"At this time, about five minutes after the beginning of the affray,
the tent had been almost beaten down&mdash;an Arab custom, with which
we were all familiar&mdash;and had we been entangled in its folds, like
mice in a trap, we should have been speared with unpleasant facility.
I gave the word for escape, and sallied out, closely followed by
Herne, with Speke in the rear. The prospect was not agreeable.
About twenty men were kneeling and crouching at the tent entrance,
whilst many dusky figures stood further off, or ran about shouting
the war-cry, or with shouts and blows drove away our camels.
Among the enemy were many of our friends and attendants; the
coast being open to them, they naturally ran away, firing a few
useless shots, and receiving a modicum of flesh-wounds.</p>

<p>"After breaking through the mob at the tent entrance, imagining
that I saw the form of Stroyan lying upon the sand, I cut my
way with my sabre towards it amongst dozens of Somal, whose
war-clubs worked without mercy, whilst the Balyuz, who was
violently pushing me out of the fray, rendered the strokes of my
sabre uncertain. This individual was cool and collected. Though
incapacitated by a sore right thumb from using the spear, he did not
shun danger, and passed unhurt through the midst of the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
His efforts, however, only illustrated the venerable adage, 'Defend
me from my friends.' I mistook him in the dark and turned to
cut him down; he cried out in alarm. The well-known voice
stopped me, and that instant's hesitation allowed a spearman
to step forward, and leave his javelin in my mouth, and retire
before he could be punished. Escaping as by a miracle, I sought
some support. Many of our Somal and servants lurking in the
darkness offered to advance, but 'tailed off' to a man as we
approached the foe. Presently the Balyuz reappeared, and led me
towards the place where he believed my three comrades had taken
refuge. I followed him, sending the only man that showed presence
of mind, one Golab of the Yusuf tribe, to bring back the <i>Aynterad</i>
craft from the Spit into the centre of the harbour. Again losing
the Balyuz in the darkness, I spent the interval before dawn wandering
in search of my comrades, and lying down when overpowered
with faintness and pain. As the day broke, with my remaining
strength I reached the head of the creek, was carried into the vessel,
and persuaded the crew to arm themselves and visit the scene of
our disasters.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, Herne, who had closely followed me, fell back,
using the butt-end of his discharged six-shooter upon the hard
heads around him. In so doing he came upon a dozen men, who,
though they loudly vociferated, 'Kill the Franks who are killing
the Somal!' allowed him to pass uninjured.</p>

<p>"He then sought his comrades in the empty huts of the town, and
at early dawn was joined by the Balyuz, who was similarly employed.
When day broke, he also sent a negro to stop the native craft, which
was apparently sailing out of the harbour, and in due time he came
on board. With the exception of sundry stiff blows with the war-club,
Herne had the fortune to escape unhurt.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, Speke's escape was in every way wonderful.
Sallying from the tent, he levelled his 'Dean and Adams'
close to an assailant's breast. The pistol refused to revolve. A
sharp blow of a war-club upon the chest felled our comrade, who
was in the rear and unseen. When he fell, two or three men sprang
upon him, pinioned his hands behind, felt him for concealed
weapons&mdash;an operation to which he submitted in some alarm&mdash;and
led him towards the rear, as he supposed, to be slaughtered.
There, Speke, who could scarcely breathe from the pain of the
blow, asked a captor to tie his hands before instead of behind, and
begged a drop of water to relieve his excruciating thirst. The
savage defended him against a number of the Somal who came up
threatening and brandishing their spears. He brought a cloth for
the wounded man to lie upon, and lost no time in procuring a
draught of water.</p>

<p>"Speke remained upon the ground till dawn. During the
interval he witnessed the war-dance of the savages&mdash;a scene
striking in the extreme; the tallest and largest warriors marching
with the deepest and most solemn tones, the song of thanksgiving.
At a little distance the grey uncertain light disclosed four or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
men lying desperately hurt, whilst their kinsmen kneaded their
limbs, pouring water upon their wounds, and placing lumps of dates
in their stiffening hands.<a name="FNanchor_5_86" id="FNanchor_5_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_86" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> As day broke, the division of plunder
caused angry passions to rise. The dead and dying were abandoned.
One party made a rush upon the cattle, and with shouts and yells
drove them off towards the wilds. Some loaded themselves with
goods; others fought over pieces of cloth, which they tore with hand
and dagger; whilst the disappointed, vociferating with rage, struck
at one another and brandished their spears. More than once during
these scenes a panic seized them; they moved off in a body to
some distance; and there is little doubt that, had our guard struck
one blow, we might still have won the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_and_Speke_desperately_wounded"></a>Richard and Speke desperately wounded.</i></div>

<p>"Speke's captor went to seek his own portion of the spoil, when
a Somal came up and asked in Hindostani what business the Frank
had in their country, and added that he would kill him if a
Christian, but spare the life of a brother Moslem. The wounded
man replied that he was going to Zanzibar, that he was still a
Nazarene, and therefore that the work had better be done at once.
The savage laughed, and passed on. He was succeeded by a
second, who, equally compassionate, whirled a sword round his
head, twice pretending to strike, but returning to the plunder without
doing damage. Presently came another manner of assailant.
Speke, who had extricated his hands, caught the spear levelled at
his breast, but received at the same moment a blow which, paralyzing
his arm, caused him to lose his hold. In defending his
heart from a succession of thrusts, he received severe wounds on
the back of his hand, his right shoulder, and his left thigh. Pausing
a little, the wretch crossed to the other side, and suddenly passed
his spear clean through the right leg of the wounded man. The
latter, 'smelling death,' then leapt up, and, taking advantage of
his assailant's terror, rushed headlong towards the sea. Looking
behind, he avoided the javelin hurled at his back, and had the good
fortune to run, without further accident, the gauntlet of a score of
missiles. When pursuit was discontinued, he sat down, faint from
loss of blood, upon a sandhill. Recovering strength by a few
minutes' rest, he staggered on to the town, where some old women
directed him to us. Then, pursuing his way, he fell in with the
party sent to seek him, and by their aid reached the craft, having
walked and run at least three miles, after receiving eleven wounds,
two of which had pierced his thighs. A touching lesson how difficult
it is to kill a man in sound health!<a name="FNanchor_6_87" id="FNanchor_6_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_87" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> My difficulty was, with my
comrades' aid, to extract the javelin which transfixed my jaws. It
destroyed my palate and four good back teeth, and left wounds on
my two cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"When we three survivors had reached the craft, Yusuf, the
Captain, armed his men with muskets and spears, landed them near
the camp, and ascertained that the enemy, expecting a fresh attack,
had fled, carrying away our cloth, tobacco, swords, and other
weapons. The corpse of Stroyan was then brought on board. Our
lamented comrade was already stark and cold. A spear had traversed
his heart, another had pierced his abdomen, and a frightful gash,
apparently of a sword, had opened the upper part of his forehead.
The body had been bruised with war-clubs, and the thighs showed
marks of violence after death. This was the severest affliction that
befell us. We had lived together like brothers. Stroyan was a
universal favourite, and his sterling qualities of manly courage,
physical endurance, and steady perseverance had augured for him
a bright career, thus prematurely cut off. Truly melancholy to
us was the contrast between the evening when he sat with us full
of life and spirits, and the morning when we saw amongst us a livid
corpse.</p>

<p>"We had hoped to preserve the remains of our friend for interment
at Aden. But so rapid were the effects of exposure that we were
compelled most reluctantly, on the morning of the 20th of April, to
commit them to the deep, Herne reading the Funeral Service.</p>

<p>"Then, with heavy hearts, we set sail for the near Arabian shore,
and, after a tedious two days, carried our friends the news of the
unexpected disaster.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F. Burton</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>When Speke wrote the manuscript of this affair, and in <i>Blackwood</i>,
and also in his book on the "Sources of the Nile," he said that <i>he</i> was
the Head of the Expedition; <i>he</i> had given the order for the night,
it was before <i>him</i> the spies were brought, <i>he</i> was the first to turn out,
and no one but <i>he</i> had the courage to defend himself. It is hardly
worth while to contradict it. It is obvious that this expedition
could only be commanded by a man who knew Arabic and some of
the other languages, of which he was perfectly ignorant.</p>

<p>So the results of this Expedition, to sum up in short, were, that
they barely escaped being caught like mice in a trap, by having their
tents thrown down upon them, the four fought bravely against three
hundred and fifty Bedawi, poor Stroyan was killed, Herne was
untouched, Richard and Speke were desperately wounded, though
they all cut their way gallantly through the enemy. Poor Speke had
eleven wounds, and Richard, with a lance transfixing his jaws, which
carried away four back teeth and part of his palate, wandered up
and down the coast suffering from his wounds, fever, hunger, and
thirst consequent on the wounds; but they met, they carried off the
dead body of their comrade, and were taken on board the native dhow
or boat, which the fortunate accident of Richard's hospitality had
retained there just half an hour, long enough to save them, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
natives sacked their property. They were so badly wounded, he had
to return to England, and here his wounds soon healed and he
picked up health. He rendered an account of his explorations
before the Royal Geographical Society.<a name="FNanchor_7_88" id="FNanchor_7_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_88" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> After a month's rest, he
obtained leave to volunteer for the Crimea. Here I would rather
give his own original manuscript word for word, because it is so
fresh, and, in a few pages, gives a better insight into outspoken
truth than many other large volumes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Crimea"></a>The Crimea.</i></div>

<p>The Crimean War is an affair of the last generation; thirty years'
distance has given it a certain perspective, and assigned its proper
rank and place in the panorama of the nineteenth century. Estimates
of its importance, of course, vary; while one man would vindicate its
<i>péripéties</i> on the plea of being the first genuine attempt to develop
the European Concert, to create an International tribunal for the
discouragement of the modern revival of <i>La Force prime le droit</i>,
and for the protection of the weak minority, others, like myself, look
upon it as an unmitigated evil to England. It showed up all her
characteristic unreadiness, all her defects of organization. It proved
that she could not <i>then</i> produce a single great <i>sailor</i> or <i>soldier</i>. It
washed her dirty linen in public, to the disgust and contempt of
Europe; and, lastly, it taught her the wholly novel and unpleasant
lesson of "playing second fiddle" (as the phrase is) to France.
Considered with regard to her foreign affairs, this disastrous blunder
lost us for ever the affection of Russia, our oldest and often our only
friend amongst the continentals of Europe. It barred the inevitable
growth of the northern Colossus in a southern direction, and
encouraged her mighty spread to the south-east, India-wards, at the
same time doubling her extent by the absorption of Turcomania.</p>

<p>The causes which led to the war are manifold enough. Some are
trivial enough, like the indiscreet revelation of Czar Nicholas' private
talk, talk anent the "Sick Man," by the undiplomatic indiscretion of
the diplomatist, Sir Hamilton Seymour. Others are vital, especially
the weariness caused by a long sleep of peace which made England,
at once the most unmilitary and the most fighting of peoples, "spoil
for a row." The belief in the wretched Turk's power of recuperation
and even of progress had been diffused by such authorities as Lords
Palmerston and Stratford de Redcliffe, and, <i>en route</i> to the war, I
often heard, to my disgust, British officers exclaim, "If there ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
be a justifiable campaign (in support of the unspeakable Turk!) it is
this."</p>

<p>Outside England, the main moving cause was our acute ally
Louis Napoleon, whose ambition was to figure arm-in-arm in the
field with the nation which annihilated his uncle. But he modestly
proposed that France should supply the army, England the navy, an
arrangement against which, even now, little can be said. Here,
however, our jaunty statesman stepped in; Cupidon (Lord Palmerston),
the man with the straw in his mouth, the persistent "Chaffer"
of wiser men that appreciated the importance of the Fenian movement,
the opposer of the Suez Canal,<a name="FNanchor_1_89" id="FNanchor_1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_89" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Minister who died one day
and was forgotten the next, refused to give up the wreath of glory;
and, upon the principle that one Englishman can fight three Frenchmen,
sent an utterly inadequate force and enabled the French to
"revenge Waterloo." French diplomatists were heavily backed
against English; a nervous desire to preserve the <i>entente cordiale</i>
made English Generals and Admirals (as at Alma and the bombardment
of Sebastopol) put up with the jockeying and bullying measures
of French officers. And the alliance ended not an hour too soon.</p>

<p>After French successes and our failures the <i>piou-piou</i> would cry
aloud, "Malakoff&mdash;yes, yes; Redan&mdash;no, no;" whereto Tommy
Atkins replied with a growl, "Waterloo, ye beggars!" And the
English medal distributed to the <i>troupier</i> was pleasantly known as
the "Médaille de Sauvetage." At the end of the disastrous year '56
England had come up smiling, after many a knock-down blow, and
was ready to go in and win. But Louis Napoleon had obtained all
<i>he</i> wanted, the war was becoming irksome to <i>his</i> fickle lieges; so an
untimely peace was patched up, and England was left to pay the
piper by the ever-increasing danger to India.</p>

<p>After the disastrous skirmish with the Somali at Berberah, it is no
wonder that I returned to England on sick certificate, wounded and
sorely discomfited. The Crimean War seemed to me some opportunity
of recovering my spirits, and, as soon as my health permitted,
I applied myself to the ungrateful task of volunteering. London
then was in the liveliest state of excitement about the Crimean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
bungles, and the ladies pitilessly cut every officer who shirked his
duty. So I read my paper about Harar before the Royal Geographical
Society, and had the pleasure of being assured by an ancient
gentleman, who had never <i>smelt</i> Africa, that when approaching the
town Harar I had crossed a large and rapid river. It was in vain for
me to reject this information. Every one seemed to think he must
be right.<a name="FNanchor_2_90" id="FNanchor_2_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_90" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Having obtained a few letters of introduction, and remembering
that I had served under General James Simpson, at Sakhar, in Sind,
I farewelled my friends, and my next step was to hurry through
France, and to embark at Marseille on board one of the Messageries
Impériales, bound for Constantinople. Very imperial was the demeanour
of her officers. They took command of the passengers in
most absolute style, and soundly wigged an Englishman, a Colonel,
for opening a port, and shipping a sea. I was ashamed of my fellow-countryman's
tameness, and yet I knew him to be a brave man.
The ship's surgeon was Dr. Nicora, who afterwards became a friend
of ours at Damascus, where he died attached to the French sanitary
establishment; he talked much, and could not conceal his Anglophobia
and hatred of the English. The only pleasant Frenchman on
board was General MacMahon, then fresh from his Algerian campaign,
and newly transferred to the Crimea, where his fortunes
began.</p>

<p>It was a spring voyage on summer seas, and in due time we stared
at the Golden Horn, and lodged ourselves at Missiri's Hôtel. The
owner, who had been a dragoman to Eöthen, presumed upon his
reputation, and made his house unpleasant. His wine, called
"Tenedos," was atrocious, his cookery third rate, and his prices
first rate. He sternly forbade "gambling," as he called card-playing,
in his house, private as well as public; and we had periodically to
kick downstairs the impudent dragomans who brought us his insolent
messages. However, he had some excuse. Society at Missiri's was
decidedly mixed; "bahaduring" was the rule, and the extra military
swagger of the juveniles, assistant-surgeons, commissariats, and such
genus, booted to the crupper, was a caution to veterans.</p>

<p>At Stamboul, I met Fred Wingfield, who was bound to Balaclava,
as assistant under the unfortunate Mr. Commissary-General Filder,
and had to congratulate myself upon my good fortune. We steamed
together over the inhospitable Euxine, which showed me the reason
for its sombre name.</p>

<p>The waters are in parts abnormally sweet, and they appear veiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
in a dark vapour. Utterly unknown the blues, amethyst and turquoise,
of that sea of beauty, the Mediterranean; the same is the case
with the smaller Palus Meotis&mdash;Azoff. After the normal three days
we sighted the Tauric Chersonese, the land of the Cimmerians and
Scythians, the colony of the Greek, the conquest of Janghiz and the
Khans of Turkey, and finally annexed by Russia after the wars, in
which Charles XII. had taught the Slav to fight. We then made
Balaclava (Balik-liwa, "Fish town"), with its dwarf fjord, dug out of
dove-coloured limestones, and forming a little port stuffed to
repletion with every manner of craft.</p>

<p>But it had greatly improved since October 17, 1854, when we
first occupied it and formally opened the absurdly so-called siege, in
which we were as often the besieged as the besiegers. Under a
prodigiously fierce-looking provost-marshal, whose every look meant
"cat," some cleanliness and discipline had been introduced amongst
the suttlers and scoundrels who populated the townlet. Store-ships
no longer crept in, reported cargoes which were worth their weight
of gold to miserables, living</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"On coffee raw and potted cat,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and crept out again without breaking bulk. A decent road had
been run through Kadikeui (Kazi's village) to camp and to the
front, and men no longer sank ankle-deep in dust, or calf-deep in
mud. In tact, England was, in the parlance of the "ring," getting
her second wind, and was settling down to her work!</p>

<p>The unfortunate Lord Raglan, with his <i>courage antique</i>, his old-fashioned
excess of courtesy, and his nervous dread of prejudicing
the <i>entente cordiale</i> (!) between England and France, had lately died.
He was in one point exactly the man <i>not</i> wanted. At his age and
with one arm and many infirmities, he could not come up to the
idea of Sir Charles Napier's model officer under the same circumstances,
"eternally on horseback, with a sword in his hand, eating,
sleeping, and drinking in the saddle."</p>

<p>But with more energy and fitness for command he might have
deputed others to take his place. A good ordinary man, placed by
the folly of his aristocratic friends in extraordinary circumstances, he
was fated, temporarily, to ruin the prestige of England. He began
by allowing himself to be ignobly tricked by that shallow intriguer,
Maréchal de Saint Arnaud (<i>alias</i> Leroy). At Alma he was persuaded
to take the worst and the most perilous position; his delicacy in not
disturbing the last hours of his fellow Commander-in-Chief prevented
his capturing the northern forts of Sebastopol, which Todleben
openly declared were to be stormed by a <i>coup de main</i>; and allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Louis Napoleon, in the <i>Moniteur</i>, to blame England only for the
<i>lâches</i> of the French, after the "last of European battles fought on
the old lines," etc. At Inkermann, where the Guards defended
themselves, like prehistoric men, with stones, Lord Raglan allowed
his whole army to be surprised by the Russians, and to be saved
by General Bosquet, with a host of Zouaves, Chasseurs, and Algerian
rifles. No wonder that a Russian general declared, "The French
saved the English at Inkermann as the Prussians did at Waterloo,
and all Europe believed that France would conquer both Russia and
England, the first by arms and the second by contrast." The "thin
red line" of Balaclava allowed some national chauvinism, but that
was all to be said in its favour, except that the gallantry of the men
was to be equalled only by the incompetency of their Chiefs.</p>

<p>I passed a week with Wingfield and other friends, in and about
Balaclava, in frequent visits to the front and camp. A favourite
excursion from the latter was to the Monastery of St. George, classic
ground where Iphigenia was saved from sacrifice. There was a
noble view from this place, a foreground of goodly garden, a deep
ravine clad with glorious trees, a system of cliffs and needles studding
a sandy beach, and a lovely stretch of sparkling sea. No wonder
that it had been chosen by a hermit, whose little hut of unhewn
blocks lay hard by; he was a man upwards of sixty apparently,
unknown to any one, and was fed by the black-robed monks. At
Kadikeui also I made the acquaintance of good Mrs. Seacole,
Jamaican by origin, who did so much for the comfort of invalids,
and whom we afterwards met with lively pleasure at Panámá.</p>

<p>The British cavalry officers in the Crimea were still violently
excited by reports that Lord Cardigan was about returning to
command; and I heard more than one say, "We will not serve
under him." And after a long experience of different opinions on
the spot, I came to the following conclusion:&mdash;The unhappy charge
of the "Six Hundred" was directly caused by my old friend, Captain
Nolan of the 15th Hussars. An admirable officer and swordsman,
bred in the gallant Austrian Cavalry of that day, he held, and
advocated through life, the theory that mounted troops were an
overmatch for infantry, and wanted only good leading to break
squares and so forth. He was burning also to see the Lights
outrival the Heavies, who, under General Scarlett, had charged down
upon Russians said to be four times their number. Lord Lucan
received an order to take a Russian 12-gun battery on the Causeway
Heights, from General Liprandi, and he sent a verbal message
by Nolan (General Airey's aide-de-camp) to his brother-in-law,
Lord Cardigan, there being bad blood between the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Nolan, who was no friend to the hero of the Black Bottle,
delivered the order disagreeably, and when Lord Cardigan showed
some hesitation, roughly cut short the colloquy with, "You have
your commands, my Lord," and prepared, as is the custom, to join
in the charge. Hardly did it begin, than he was struck by a shot
in the breast, and, as he did not fall at once, some asked Lord
Cardigan where he was, and the reply came, "I saw him go off
howling to the rear." During the fatal charge Lord Cardigan lost
his head, and had that <i>moment de peur</i> to which the best soldiers are
at times subject. He had been a fire-eater with the "Saw-handles,"
and the world expected too much of him; again, a man of ordinary
pluck, he was placed in extraordinary circumstances, and how few
there are who are <i>born</i> physically fearless. I can count those
known to me on the fingers of my right hand. Believing that his
force was literally mown down, he forgot his duty as a Commanding
Officer, and instead of rallying the fugitives, he thought only of
<i>sauve qui peut</i>. Galloping wildly to the rear, he rushed up to
many a spectator, amongst others to my old Commander, General
Beatson, nervously exclaiming, "You saw me at the guns?" and
almost without awaiting a reply, rode on. Presently returning to
England, he had not the sound sense and good taste to keep himself
in the background; but received a kind of "ovation," as they call it,
the ladies trying to secure hairs from his charger's tail by way of
keepsake. Of course he never showed his face in the Crimea again.
The tale of this ill-fated and unprofessional charge has now changed
complexion. It is held up as a <i>beau fait d'armes</i>, despite the best
bit of military criticism that ever fell from soldier's lips: "<i>c'est beau,
mais ce n'est pas la guerre</i>," the words of General Bosquet, who saved
the poor remnants of the Lights.</p>

<p>At head-quarters I called upon the Commander-in-Chief, General
Simpson, whom years before I had found in charge of Sakhar,
Upper Sind, held by all as wellnigh superannuated. He was
supposed to be one of Lever's heroes, the gigantic Englishman
who, during the occupation of Paris, broke the jaw of the duelling
French officer, and spat down his throat. But age had told upon
him, mentally as well as bodily, and he became a mere plaything in
the hands of the French, especially of General Pélissier, the typical
Algerian officer, who well knew when to browbeat and when to
cajole. "Jimmy Simpson," as the poor old incapable was called,
could do nothing for me, so I wrote officially at once to General
Beatson, whom I had met at Boulogne, volunteering for the Irregular
Cavalry then known as "Beatson's Horse," and I was delighted
when my name appeared in orders. Returning to Constantinople,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
I called upon the Embassy, then in summer quarters at Therapia,
where they had spent an anxious time. The gallant Vukados,
Russianized in Boutákoff, a Greek, who, in the nineteenth century,
belonged to the heroic days of Thermopylæ and Marathon, and who
was actually cheered by his enemies, with the little merchant-brig
the <i>Wladimir</i>, alias <i>Arciduca Giovanni</i>, had shown himself a
master-breaker-of-blockades, and might readily have taken into his head to
pay the Ambassador a visit.</p>

<p>I looked forward to a welcome and found one; a man who had
married my aunt, Robert Bagshaw, of Dovercourt, M.P., and
quondam Calcutta merchant, who had saved from impending bankruptcy
the house of Alexander and Co., to which Lady Stratford
belonged.</p>

<p>Nothing quainter than the contrast between that highly respectable
middle-class British peer and the extreme wildness of his surroundings.
There were but two exceptions to the general rule of
eccentricity&mdash;one, Lord Napier and Ettrick with his charming wife, and
the other, Odo (popularly called "O don't!") Russell, who died as
Lord Ampthill, Ambassador to Berlin. It was, by-the-by, no bad idea
to appoint this high-bred and average talented English gentleman
to the Court of Prince Bismarck, who disliked and despised nothing
more thoroughly than the pert little political, the "Foreign Office
pet" of modern days.</p>

<p>Foremost on the roll stood Alison, who died Minister at Teheran.
He was in character much more a Greek than an Englishman, with
a peculiar <i>finesse</i>, not to put too fine a point upon it, which made him
highly qualified to deal with a certain type of Orientals. He knew
Romaic perfectly, Turkish well, Persian a little, and a smattering of
Arabic; so that, most unlike the average order of ignorant secretaries
and attachés, he was able to do good work. He seemed to affect
eccentricity, went out walking with a rough coat with a stick torn
from a tree, whence his cognomen "The Bear with the Ragged
Staff," and at his breakfasts visitors were unpleasantly astonished by
a weight suddenly mounting their shoulders in the shape of a bear-cub
with cold muzzle and ugly claws. He managed to hold his own
with his testy and rageous old Chief, and the following legend was
told of him:&mdash;"Damn your eyes, Mr. Alison, why was not that
despatch sent?" "Damn your Excellency's eyes, it went this
morning." Miladi also seemed to regard his comical figure with
much favour. At Teheran he did little good, having become
unhappily addicted to "tossing the elbow," which in an evil hour
was reported home by my late friend Edward Eastwick; and he
married a wealthy Levantine widow, who predeceased him. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
occasion he behaved uncommonly well, by returning all her large
fortune to her family.</p>

<p>Next to him in office, and far higher in public esteem, ranked
Percy Smythe, who succeeded his brother as Lord Strangford.
Always of the weakest possible constitution, and so purblind that
when reading he drew the paper across his nose, he fulfilled my
idea of the typical linguist in the highest sense of the word; in
fact, I never saw his equal except, perhaps, Professor Palmer, who
was murdered by Arábi's orders almost within sight of Suez. Strangford
seemed to take in a language through every pore, and to
have time for all its niceties and eccentricities: for instance, he
could speak Persian like a Shirázi, and also with the hideous drawl
of a Hindostani. Yet his health sent him to bed every night
immediately after dinner, for which he was more than once taken
severely to task by Lady Stratford. He dressed in the seediest of
black frock-coats, and was once mightily offended by a Turkish officer,
who, overhearing us talking in Persian about "Tasáwaf" (Sufi-ism),
joined in the conversation. He treated me with great regard because
I was in the gorgeous Bashi-Bazouk uniform, blazing with gold, but
looked upon Lord Strangford with such contempt that the latter
exclaimed, "Hang the fellow! Can't he see that I am a gentleman?"
I then told him that an Eastern judges <i>entirely</i> by dress, and
that, as I was gorgeous, I was supposed to be the swell, and that, as
his coat was very shabby, he was taken for a poor interpreter,
probably my dragoman, and induced him to change for the
future.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards, when he came to the title, he married
Emily Beaufort, the result of reviewing her book "Syrian Shrines,"
etc. The choice was a mistake; she was far too like him in body
and mind, with a strong dash of Israelitish blood, to be a success
matrimonially speaking. Had he taken to wife a comely "crummy"
little girl with blue eyes, barley-sugar hair, and the rest to match,
he might have lived much longer. But the lady was an overmatch
for him. When she was a little tot of twelve I saw her at the head
of her father's, the hydrographer's table, laying down the law of
professional matters to grey-headed Admirals. The last of the Staff
was General Mansfield, an ill-conditioned and aggressive man, who
held General Beatson in especial dislike for "prostitution of military
rank." I have the most unpleasant remembrance of him; he
afterwards became Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India, and
his conduct in the "Affair of the Pickles" ought to have caused
the recall of "Lord Sandhurst."</p>

<p>The Ambassador, whose name was at that time in every mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
was as remarkable in appearance as in character and career. When
near sixty years of age he had still the clear-cut features and handsome
face of his cousin, whom he loved to call the "Great Canning,"
and under whom, he, like Lord Palmerston, had began official life as
private secretary. One of the cleanest and smoothest shaven of old
men, he had a complexion white and red as a Westphalia ham, and
his silver locks gave him a venerable and pleasing appearance;
whilst his chin, that most characteristic feature, showed, in repose,
manliness, and his "Kaiser-blue" eye was that of the traditional
Madonna, only at excited moments the former tilted up with an
expression of reckless obstinacy, and the latter flashed fire like an
enraged feline's. The everyday look of the face was diplomatic, an
icy impassibility (evidently put on, and made natural by long habit);
but it changed to the scowl of a Medusa in fits of rage, and in
joyous hours, such as sitting at dinner near the beautiful Lady
George Paget&mdash;whose like I never saw&mdash;it was harmonious and
genial as a day in spring.</p>

<p>Such was the personal appearance of the man who, together with
the Emperor Nicholas, one equally, if not more remarkable, both in
body and in mind, set the whole Western World in a blaze. I
heard the origin of the blood-feud minutely told by the late Lord
Clanricarde, one of the most charming <i>raconteurs</i> and original
conversationalists ever met at a London dinner-table. Mr. Stratford
Canning became, in early manhood, <i>Chargé d'affaires</i> at Constantinople,
and took a prominent part in the Treaty of Bucharest,
which the Czar found, to speak mildly, unpalatable. However,
some years after, when the Embassy at St. Petersburg fell vacant,
the Emperor refused to receive this <i>personâ ingrata</i>, and aroused
susceptibilities which engendered a life-long hatred and a lust for
revenge. Lastly, after the affair of 1848, the "Eltchi" persuaded
his unhappy tool, the feeble-minded Sultan, Abd Al-Majid, whom he
scolded and abused like a naughty schoolboy, now by threats then
by promises, to refuse giving up the far-famed Hungarian refugees.
This again became well known to all the world, and thus a private
and personal pique between two elderly gentlemen of high degree,
involved half Europe in hideous war, and was one of the worst
disasters ever known to English history, by showing the world how
England could truckle to France, and allow her to play the leading
part.</p>

<p>Lord Stratford had, as often happens to shrewder men, completely
mistaken his vocation. He told me more than once that his inclination
was wholly to the life of a <i>littérateur</i>, and he showed himself unfit
for taking any, save the humblest, <i>rôle</i> among the third-rates. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
had lived his life in the East without learning a word of Turkish,
Persian, or Arabic.</p>

<p>He wrote "poetry," and, amid the jeers of his staff, he affixed to
a rustic seat near Therapia, where once Lady Stratford had sat, a
copy of verses beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"A wife, a mother to her children dear,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>with rhyme "rested here," and reason to match. After his final
return home he printed a little volume of antiquated "verse or
<i>worse</i>" with all the mediocrity which the gods and the columns
disallow, and which would hardly have found admittance to the
poet's corner of a country paper. His last performance in this line
was a booklet entitled, "Why I am a Christian" (he of all men!),
which provoked a shout of laughter amongst his friends. They
owned that, mentally, he was a fair modern Achilles&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis acer;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>but of his "Christianity," the popular saying was, "He is a Christian,
and he never forgives." His characteristic was vindictiveness; he
could not forget (and here he was right), but also he could not
forgive (and here he was wrong). One instance: he tried to hunt
out of the service Grenville Murray, whose "Roving Englishman"
probably owed much of its charm to Dickens's staff in <i>Household
Words</i>. Yet Murray, despite all his faults, was a capable man,
and a Government more elastic and far-seeing and less "respectable"
than that of England, would have greatly profited by his services.
Lord Stratford could not endure badinage, he had no sense for and
of humour; witness the scene between him and Louis Napoleon's
Ambassador, General Baraguay d'Hilliers, recorded by Mr. Consul
Skene in his "Personal Reminiscences." He abhorred difference
of opinion, and was furious with me for assuring him that "Habash"
and "Abyssinia" are by no means equivalent and synonymous
terms; he had been enlightening the "Porte" with information
that Turkey had never held a foot of ground in "Habash," when
the Turk, as my visit to Harar showed, had been an occupant, well
hated, as he was well known. And when in a rage he was not
pleasant; his eyes flashed fury, his venerable locks seemed to rise
like the quills of a fretful porcupine, he would rush round the room
like a lean maniac using frightful language&mdash;in fact, "langwidge," as
the sailor hath it&mdash;with his old dressing-gown working hard to keep
pace with him, and when the fit was at its worst, he would shake his
fist in the offender's face.</p>

<p>The famous Ambassador struck me as a weak, stiff-necked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
violent old man, whose strength physically was in his obstinate chin,
together with a "pursed-up mouth and beak in a pet," and morally
in an exaggerated "respectability," iron-bound prejudices, and
profound self-esteem. He had also a firm respect for rank and the
divine right of Kings; witness his rage, when the young naval lieutenant,
Prince of Leiningen, was ordered by a superior officer to
"swab decks." He lived long enough to repent the last step of his
official life. After peace was concluded, a visit to the Crimea
greatly disgusted him. With a kind of bastard repentance, he quoted
John Bright and the Peace Party in his sorrow at having brought
about a Campaign whose horrors contrasted so miserably with its
promised advantages.</p>

<p>In the next Russian-Turkish War he remembered that some ten
thousand English lives and £80,000,000 had been sacrificed to humble
Russia, whose genius and heroism had raised her so high in the
opinion of Europe, only to serve the selfish ends of Louis Napoleon,
to set up Turkey and the Sultan ("Humpty-dumpty," who refused to
be set up), and to humour the grudges of two rancorous old men. So
he carefully preached non-intervention to England. He took his
seat in the House of Lords, but spoke little, and when he spoke he
mostly broke down. Of his literary failures I have already spoken.
Yet this was the "Great Eltchi" of Eöthen, a man who gained a
prodigious name in Europe, chiefly by living out of it.</p>

<p>After seeing all that was to be seen at Therapia and Constantinople,
I embarked on an Austrian Lloyd steamer, and ran down to the
Dardanelles, then the head-quarters of the Bashi-Bazouks. The
little town shared in the factitious importance of Gallipoli, and
other places more or less useful during the war; it had two Pashas,
Civil and Military, with a large body of Nizam or Regulars, whilst
the hillsides to the north were dotted with the white tents of the
Irregulars. General Beatson had secured fair quarters near the
old windmills, and there had established himself with his wife and
daughters. I at once recognized my old Boulogne friend, although
slightly disguised by uniform. He looked like a man of fifty-five,
with bluff face and burly figure, and probably grey hair became him
better than black. He always rode English chargers of good blood,
and altogether his presence was highly effective.</p>

<p>There had been much silly laughing at Constantinople, especially
amongst the grinning idiot tribe, about his gold coat, which was
said to stand upright by force of embroidery. But here he was
perfectly right, and his critics perfectly wrong. He had learnt
by many years' service to recognize the importance of show and
splendour when dealing with Easterns. And no one had criticised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the splendid Skinner or General Jacob of the Sind Horse, for wearing
a silver helmet and a diamond-studded sabretache. General Beatson
had served thirty-five years in the Bengal army, and was one of the
few amongst his contemporaries who had campaigned in Europe
during the long peace which followed the long war. In his subaltern
days he had volunteered into the Spanish Legion, under the
Commander, General Sir de Lacy Evans. After some hard fighting
there, and seeing not a few adventures, he had returned to India.
When the Crimean War broke out he went to Head-quarters at
once, and, for the mere fun of the thing, joined in the Heavy Cavalry
charge.</p>

<p>In October, 1854, the Duke of Newcastle, then Minister of
War, addressed him officially, directing him to organize a Corps of
Bashi-Bazouks, not exceeding in number four thousand, who were
to be independent of the Turkish Contingent, consisting of twenty-five
thousand Regulars under General Vivian. So, unfortunately
for himself, he had made the Dardanelles his Head-quarters, and
there he seemed to be settled with his wife and family. Mrs.
Beatson was a quiet-looking little woman, who was reputed to rule
her spouse with a rod of iron in a velvet case; and the two daughters
were charming girls who seemed to have been born on horseback,
and who delighted in setting their terriers at timid aides-de-camp,
and teaching their skittish little Turkish nags to lash out at them
when within kicking distance. General Beatson at once introduced
me to his Staff and officers, amongst whom I found some most
companionable comrades. There were two ex-Guardsmen, poor
Charles Wemyss, who died years after, chronically impecunious,
in London, and Major Lennox-Berkeley, who is still living. Of
the Home army were Lieut.-Colonel Morgan, ex-cavalry man, and
Major Synge. The Indian army had contributed Brigadier-General
De Renzi, Brett, Hayman, Money, Grierson, and others. Sankey,
whom I had known in Egypt, and whose family I had met at Malta,
had been gazetted as lieutenant-colonel. There was also poor
Blakeley of the Gun, who afterwards died so unhappily of yellow
fever at Chorillos, in Perú.</p>

<p>But there were unfortunately black sheep among the number.
Lieut.-Colonel Fardella had only the disadvantage of being a Sicilian,
but Lieut.-Colonel Giraud, the head interpreter, was a Smyrniote
and a Levantine of the very worst description, and, worse still, there
was a Lieut.-Colonel O'Reilly, whose antecedents and subsequents
were equally bad. He had begun as a lance-corporal in one of her
Majesty's regiments, which he had left under discreditable circumstances.
In the Bashi-Bazouks he joined a faction against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
General Beatson, and when the war was over he openly became
a Mussulman, and entered the Turkish service. He left the worst
of reputations between Constantinople and Marocco, and Englishmen
had the best reason to be ashamed of him. In subsequent
years to the Massacre of Damascus, the English Government had
chosen out Fuad Pasha, a witty, unscrupulous, and over-clever
Turk, and proposed him as permanent Governor-General of the
Holy Land, or to govern in a semi-independent position, like
that of the Khedive of Egypt.</p>

<p>No choice could be worse, except that of the French, who favoured
with even more inaptitude, by way of a rival candidate, their Algerian
captive, the Emir Abd el Kadir, one of the most high-minded,
religious, and honourable of men, who was utterly unfit to cope
with Turkish roguery and Syrian rascaldom. The project fell
through, but till his last day Fuad Pasha never lost sight of it, and
kept up putting in an appearance, by causing perpetual troubles
amongst the Bedawi and the Druzes.</p>

<p>This man O'Reilly was one of his many tools, and at last, when
he had brought about against the Turkish Government an absurd
revolt of naked Arabs, upon the borders of the Hamah Desert, he
was taken prisoner and carried before Rashíd Pasha, then the
Governor-General, and in his supplications for pardon he had the
meanness to kneel down and kiss the Turk's foot.</p>

<p>But worse still was the position of the affairs which met my eyes
at the Dardanelles. Everything had combined to crush our force of
Irregulars. First, there was the Greek faction, who naturally hated
the English, and adored the Russians, and directed all the national
genius to making the foreigners fail. Their example was followed by
the Jews, many of them wealthy merchants at the Dardanelles, who
in those days, before the Juden-hetze, loved and believed in Russia
and had scanty confidence in England. The two Turkish pashas
were exceedingly displeased to see an <i>Imperium in Imperio</i>, and did
their best to breed disturbance between their Regulars and the English
Irregulars. They were stirred up by the German Engineers, who
were employed upon the fortifications of the Dardanelles, and who
strongly inoculated them with the idea that France and England
aimed at nothing less than annexation.</p>

<p>Hence the Pashas not only fomented every disturbance, but they
supplied deserters with passports and safe-conducts. The French
played the friendly-foelike party; the envy, jealousy, and malice
of the <i>Gr-r-r-ande Nation</i> had been stirred to the very depths by
the failure of their Algerine General Yousouf in organizing a corps
of Irregulars, and they saw with displeasure and disgust that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Englishman was going to succeed. Accordingly Battus, their wretched
little French Consul for the Dardanelles, was directed to pack the
local Press at Constantinople (which was almost wholly in the French
interests) with the falsest and foulest scandals. He had secured
the services of the <i>Journal de Constantinople</i>, which General Beatson
had with characteristic carelessness neglected to square, and his
cunningly concocted scandals found their way not only into the
Parisian, but even into the London Press.</p>

<p>But our deadliest enemies were of course those nearest home.
Mr. Calvert was at that time Vice-Consul for the Dardanelles, and
he openly boasted of its having been made by himself so good a
thing that he would not exchange it for a Consulate General. I
need not enter into the subsequent career of this man, who, shortly
after the Crimean War, found his way into a felon's jail at Malta, for
insuring a non-existing ship. He had proposed to General Beatson
a contract in the name of a creature of his own, who was a mere
man of straw, and it was at once refused, because, although Mr.
Vice-Consul Calvert might have gained largely thereby, Her Majesty's
Government would have lost in proportion. This was enough to
make a bitter enemy of him, and he was a manner of Levantine,
virulent and scrupulous as he was sharp-witted. He also had another
grievance. In his Consulate he kept a certain Lieutenant Ogilvie,
who years after fought most gallantly in the Franco-German War,
and was looked upon, after he was killed, as a sort of small national
hero.</p>

<p>He and his agents were buying up cattle for the public use, and
it was a facetious saying amongst the "Buzoukers," as the Bashi-Bazouk
officers were called, that they had not left a single three-legged
animal in the country. It is no wonder that the reports of
these men had a considerable effect upon Lord Stratford, who was
profoundly impressed with the opinions of unhappy Lord Raglan,
the Commander, who by weak truckling to the French, a nettle fit
only to be grasped, had more than once placed us in an unworthy
position. He was angrily opposed to the whole scheme; it was contrary
to precedent: Irregulars were unknown at Waterloo, and the
idea was offensive, because unknown to the good old stock and
pipe-clay school. Moreover, but for a Campaign these men are
invaluable to act as eyes and feelers for a regular force. The
English soldier, unless he be a poacher&mdash;by-the-by, one of the best
of them&mdash;cannot see by night; his want of practice gives him a kind
of "noctilypia," and he suffers much from want of sleep. His
Excellency already had his own grievance against General Beatson,
being enormously scandalized by a letter from the Irregular officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
casually proposing to hang the Military Pasha of the Dardanelles, if
he continued to intrigue and report falsely concerning his force.
And I must confess the tone of the General's letter was peculiar,
showing that he was better known to "Captain Sword" than to
"Captain Pen." When he put me in orders as "Chief of the Staff"
I overhauled his books and stood aghast to see the style of his
official despatches. He was presently persuaded, with some difficulty,
to let me mitigate their candour under the plea of copying, but on
one occasion after the copy was ready I happened to look into the
envelope, and I found&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;This is official, but I would have your Lordship to know
that I also wear a black coat."</p></blockquote>

<p>Fancy the effect of a formal challenge to combat, "pistols for two
and coffee for one," upon the rancorous old man of Constantinople,
whose anger burnt like a red-hot fire, and whose revenge was always
at a white heat! I took it out, but my General did not thank me
for it.</p>

<p>The result of these scandalous rumours was, that Lord Stratford
deemed fit to send down the Dardanelles (for the purpose of reporting
the facts of the case) a certain Mr. Skene. I have no intention
of entering into the conduct of this official, who had been an officer in
the English army, and who proposed to make himself comfortable
in the Consulate of Aleppo! He has paid the debt of Nature, and
I will not injure his memory. Suffice it to say, that he was known
on the spot to be taking notes, that every malignant won his ear, and
that he did not cease to gratify the Ambassador's prejudices by
reporting the worst.</p>

<p>General Beatson was peppery, like most old Indians, and instead
of keeping diplomatically on terms with Mr. Skene, he chose to have
a violent personal quarrel with him. Consequently Mr. Skene
returned to Constantinople, and his place was presently taken by
Brigadier T. G. Neil, who shortly appeared in the same capacity&mdash;note-taker.
His offensive presence and bullying manner immediately
brought on another quarrel, especially when he loudly declared that
"he represented Royalty," and that he was a universal unfavourite
with Beatson's Horse. He afterwards served in the Indian Mutiny,
and there he ended well. He made an enormous reputation at
home by recklessly daring to arrest a railway clerk, and he was shot
before his incapacity could be discovered.</p>

<p>I was also struck with consternation at the condition of Beatson's
Horse, better known on the spot as the "Bashi-Bazouks." The
correct term in Turkish is <i>Bāsh Buzuk</i>, equivalent to <i>Tête-pourrie</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
it succeeded the ancient <i>Dillis</i>, or madmen, who in the good old
times represented the Osmanli Irregular Cavalry. It was the habit
of those men in early spring, when the fighting season opened, to
engage themselves for a term to plunder and loot all they could
(and at this process they were first-rate hands), and to return home
when winter set in. General Beatson wisely determined that his
four thousand sabres should be wholly unconnected with the twenty-five
thousand men of the Turkish Contingent. He wished to
raise them in Syria, Asia Minor, Bulgaria, and other places,
regiment them according to their nationalities, and to officer them,
like Sepoy regiments, with Englishmen and Subalterns of their own
races.</p>

<p>The idea was excellent, but it was badly carried out, mainly by
default of the War Office, which had overmuch to do and could
not be at the trouble of sending out officers. So the men, whose
camps looked soldier-like enough, were left lying on the hillsides,
and Satan found a very fair amount of work for them. This was,
however, chiefly confined to duelling, and other such pastimes. The
Arnauts or Albanians, who generally fight when they are drunk, had
a peculiar style of monomachy. The principals, attended by their
seconds and by all their friends, stood close opposite, each holding a
cocked pistol in their right hand and a glass of <i>raki</i>, or spirits of wine,
in their left. The first who drained his draught had the right to fire,
and generally blazed away with fatal effect. It would have been
useless to discourage this practice, but I insisted on fair play.
Although endless outrages were reported at Constantinople, very few
really took place: only one woman was insulted, and robbery with
violence was exceptionally rare. In fact, the <i>Tête-pourries</i> contrasted
most favourably with the unruly French detachments at Gallipoli, and
with the turbulent <i>infirmiers</i> of the Nagara Hospital. With the
English invalids at the Abydos establishment no disputes ever arose.</p>

<p>The exaggerated mutinies were mere sky-larking. After a few
days' grumbling, a knot of "Rotten Heads" would mount their nags
with immense noise and clatter, and, loudly proclaiming that they
could stand the dullness of life no longer, would ride away, hoping
only to be soon caught. But the worst was, I could see no business
doing; there were no morning roll-calls or evening parades, no drilling
or disciplining of men, and the General contented himself with riding
twice a day through the camp, and listening to many grievances.
However, as soon as I was made "Chief of the Staff," I persuaded
him that this was not the thing, and induced him to establish all
three, and to add thereto a riding school for sundry officers of
infantry who were not very firm in the saddle, and also to open a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
School of Arms for the benefit of <i>all</i> (the last thing a British officer
learns is, to use his "silly sword"); and the consequence was, that
we soon had a fine body of well-trained sabres, ready to do anything
or to go anywhere.</p>

<p>The <i>Maître d'armes</i> was an Italian from Constantinople, and
he began characteristically by proposing to call out the little
Consul Battus, while another purposed making love to Madame!
Alas! it was too late. On September 12th, a gunboat, dressed
in all her colours, steamed at full speed down the Dardanelles,
and caused an immense excitement in camp. The news flew like
wildfire that Sebastopol had been captured. It proved, to say the
least, premature, and the details filled every Englishman with disgust.
I need not describe the grand storming of the Malakoff,
which gave Pélissier his <i>bâton de Maréchal</i>, or the gallant carrying
of the Little Redan by Bourbaki. But our failure at the Great Redan
was simply an abomination. Poor old Jemmy Simpson was persuaded
by Pélissier to play the second part, and to attack from the
very same trench as that which sent forth the unsuccessful assault of
June 18th. About half the force required was sent, and these were
mostly regiments which had before suffered severely, and the
bravest of them could only stand up to be shot down, instead of
sneaking, as not a few did, in the trenches. Lastly, instead of leading
them himself, the Commander-in-Chief sent General Wyndham,
whose gasconade about putting on his gloves under fire seems to
be the only item of this disgraceful affair which appears known to
and remembered by the British public. The result of our attack
was simply a <i>sauve qui peut</i>, and (<i>proh pudor!</i>) the Piedmontese
General Cialdini was obliged to order up one of his brigades to save
the British.</p>

<p>Continentals attributed this systematic paucity of our troops to
the most urgent emergencies, either to inconsiderate national
parsimony, or to overweening contempt for the enemy. It was
nothing of the kind; it resulted from the normal appointment of
thoroughly incapable Commanders. The private soldier was perfectly
right, who volunteered before Lord Raglan that he and his
comrades were perfectly ready to take Sebastopol by storm, under
the Command of their own officers, if not interfered with by the
<i>Generals</i>.</p>

<p>I now thought that I saw my way to a grand success, and my
failure was proportionally absurd. This was nothing less than the
relief of Kars, which was doomed to fall by famine, to the Russians.
Pélissier and the Frenchmen were long-sighted enough to know the
culminating importance of this stronghold as a <i>pierre d'échappe</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
way of Russia, and possibly, or rather probably, they had orders
from home. However, they managed to keep Omar Pasha and his
Turkish troops in the Crimea, where this large force were compelled
to lie idle, instead of being sent to attack the Trans-Caucasian
provinces, where they might have done good service. So when
Omar Pasha, on the 29th of September, gloriously defeated the
Russians before the walls of Kars, his victory was useless, and he was
compelled to retire. Had the affair been managed in other ways,
England might have struck a vital blow at Russia, by driving her
once more behind the Caucasus, and by putting off for many a
year the threatened advance upon India, which is now one of our
<i>cauchemars</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the reports concerning the siege of Kars, whose
gallant garrison was allowed to succumb to famine, cholera, and the
Russians, were becoming a scandal. It was reported that General
Williams, who, with the Hungarian General Metz, was taking a
prominent part in the defence, addressed upwards of eighty officials
to Lord Stratford without receiving a single reply; in fact, as Mr.
Skene's book shows, the great man only turned them into ridicule.
However, the "Eltchi" feared ultimate consequences, and wrote to
Lieut.-General (afterwards Sir) Robert J. Hussey-Vivian, to consult
him concerning despatching on secret errand the Turkish Contingent,
consisting, as it may be remembered, of twenty-five thousand Nizam
or Regulars, commanded by a sufficiency of British officers.</p>

<p>The answer was that <i>no</i> carriage could be procured. Vivian,
who was a natural son of Lord Vivian's, had seen some active
service in his youth, but he was best known as an Adjutant-General
of the Madras army, a man redolent of pipe-clay and red tape, and
servilely subject to the Ambassador. So I felt that the game was in
<i>my</i> hands, and proceeded in glorious elation of spirits to submit my
project for the relief of Kars to his Excellency. We had already 2640
sabres in perfect readiness to march, and I could have procured <i>any
quantities</i> of carriage. The scene which resulted passes description.
He shouted at me in a rage, "You are the most impudent man
in the Bombay Army, Sir!" But I knew him, and understood him
like Alison, and did not mind. It ended with, "Of course you'll
dine with us to-day?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not until some months afterwards that I learnt what my
unhappy plan proposed to do. Kars was doomed to fall as a make-weight
for the capture of half of Sebastopol, and a Captain of Bashi-Bazouks
(myself) had madly attempted to arrest the course of <i>haute
politique</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The tale of the fall of Kars is pathetic enough. While the
British officers dined with General Mouravieff, the gallant Turkish
soldiers were ordered to <i>pile</i> arms and march off under escort, and,
dashing their muskets to the ground, they cried, "Perish our Wazirs
who have even shamed us with this shame." And the disastrous
and dishonourable result brought about by our political inaptitude
has never ceased to weaken our prestige in Central Asia. Civilized
Turks simply declared that an officer of artillery, sent out as Commissioner
by England, had unwarrantably interfered with the legitimate
command of Kars, where Turkey had a powerful army and an
important position; and that by keeping the soldiers behind walls,
when he knew the City could not be saved, he had lost both Army
and City. The criticism was fair and sound.</p>

<p>General (afterwards Sir) W. F. Williams of Kars was at first in
huge indignation, and declared that he would persuade the Government
to impeach Lord Stratford. But on the way he was met by an
offer of the Command at Woolwich, which apparently made him hold
his peace. He was somewhat an exceptional man. For years an
instructor of the Turkish Artillery, then English member of the
mixed Commission for the topography of the Turko-Persian frontier,
and finally Queen's Commissioner with the Turkish army at Kars,
he had never learnt a word of Turkish. Of course he was hustled
into the House of Commons. Whenever a man makes himself
known in England that is apparently his ultimate fate. But he fell
flatly, as even Kars did, before the sharp tongue of Bernal Osborne.
During some debate on the Chinese question, he had assured the
House that he was an expert, because he had had much experience
of Turkish matters. "Oh, the fall of Kars!" cried the wit; and
the ex-Commissioner was extinguished for ever.</p>

<p>Lord Stratford, I suppose by way of consoling <i>me</i>, made an
indirect offer, through Lord Napier and Ettrick, about commissioning
me to pay an official visit to Schamyl, whom some call "The
Patriot," and others "The Bandit," of the Caucasus. The idea was
excellent, but somewhat surprised me. Schamyl had lately been
accused, amongst other atrocious actions, of flogging Russian ladies
whom he had taken prisoners, and I could not understand how Lord
Stratford, who had an unmitigated horror of all Russian cruelties,
and who always expressed it in the rawest terms, could ally himself
with such a ruffian. Possibly the political advantages in his opinion
counterbalanced his demerits, for, had Schamyl been fairly supported,
the Russian conquest of the great mountains might have been
retarded for years. I consulted on the subject Alison and Percy
Smythe, and both were of the same opinion, namely, that although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
there were difficulties and dangers, involving a long ride through
Russian territory, the task might have been accomplished. They
relied greatly upon the ardent patriotism of the Circassian women
who then filled the harems of Constantinople. I should not have
seen a single face, except perhaps that of a slave-girl, but I should
have been warmly assisted with all the interest the fair patriots
could make. So I began seriously to think of the matter. But the
first visit to Lord Stratford put it entirely out of my head. I asked
his Excellency what my reply was to be, should Schamyl ask me
upon what mission I came. "Oh, say that you are sent to report
to <i>me</i>." "But, my lord, Schamyl will expect money, arms, and
possibly troops, and what am I to reply if he asks me about it?
Otherwise he will infallibly set me down for a spy, and my chance
of returning to Constantinople will be uncommonly small."</p>

<p>However, the "Eltchi" could not see it in that light, and the
project fell through.</p>

<p>Here also, although somewhat out of place, I may relate my last
chance of carrying out a project upon which I was very warm,
namely, to assist Circassia and to attack Georgia.</p>

<p>On returning to London I received a hint that Lord Palmerston
had still some project of the kind, and was willing that I should be
employed on it. So I wrote a number of letters, which I was
allowed to publish in the <i>Times</i>, upon the subject of levying a large
force of Kurdish Irregular Cavalry, and these being supported by
the excellent work of Sir Henry Rawlinson, found favour with the
public. But presently came the Franco-Russian peace of 1856.
France, who had won all the credit of the mismanaged Campaign
because she washed her dirty linen at home, and who had left all
the discredit to England, whose practice was the opposite, lost all
interest in the war. Louis Napoleon was thoroughly satisfied with
what he had done, and Russia, after a most gallant and heroic
defence of her territory, wanted time to heal her wounds. Accordingly
the Treaty of Paris was entered into, the result being that,
fifteen years afterwards, when France was in her sorest straits,
Russia, with the consent of England (!), tore up that treaty and
threw it in our face.</p>

<p>After this fruitless visit to Constantinople, I returned post haste
to the Dardanelles, where I found the Bashi-Bazouks, like the unfortunate
Turks at Kars, in a state of siege. On the morning of the
26th of September we were astounded to see the Turkish Regulars
drawn out in array against us, Infantry supported by the guns,
which were pointed at our camp, and patrols of Cavalry occupying
the rear. Three War-steamers commanded the main entrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the Town, and the enemy's outposts were established within three
hundred yards of the 1st Regiment of Beatson's Horse, evidently
for the purpose of ensuring a sanguinary affair. The inhabitants
had closed their shops, and the British Consulate was deserted.
The steamer <i>Redpole</i> was sent off in hottest haste to Constantinople
with a report that a trifling squabble between the French <i>infirmiers</i>
and the Bashi-Bazouks had ended in deadly conflict, and that the
most terrible consequences were likely to ensue.</p>

<p>General Beatson at once issued an order to his men, who were
furious at this fresh insult, and requested permission to punish the
aggressors by taking the enemy's guns; and by means of his officers
<i>he restrained the natural anger of his much-suffering men</i>.</p>

<p>The result was a triumph of discipline, and not a shot was fired
that day. About four p.m. the Military Pasha, ashamed of his attitude,
marched the Regulars back to their barracks, but he did not
fail to complain to Constantinople of General Beatson's order,
keeping his men in camp "till the Turkish authorities should have
recovered from their panic and <i>housed</i> their guns." But the <i>Redpole</i>
had also carried from the English and French Consuls an exaggerated
account of the state of affairs, and earnestly requesting a reinforcement.
The reply was an order from Lieut.-General Vivian
removing General Beatson from command, and directing him to
make it over to Major-General Richard Smith, who appeared at
the Dardanelles on September 28th, supported by a fresh body
of Nizam; and, lest any insult might be omitted, three hundred
French soldiers had been landed at the Nagára Hospital to attack
us in the rear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="End_of_Crimea"></a>End of Crimea.</i></div>

<p>General Beatson was at the time suffering from an accident, and
was utterly unfitted for business. So Major Berkeley and I collected
as many of the officers as we could at head-quarters, and proposed
to go in a body to General Smith and lay the case before him. We
assured him that all the reports were false, and proposed to show
him the condition and the discipline of the Bashi-Bazouks; we also
suggested that Brigadier-General Brett might be directed to assume
temporary Command of the Force, until fresh orders and instructions
should be received from General Vivian. Of course General Smith
could not comply with our request, so we both declared that we
would send in our resignations. After an insult of the kind, we felt
that we could no longer serve with self-respect. It was this proceeding,
I suppose, which afterwards gave rise to a report that I
had done my best to cause a Mutiny.</p>

<p>On the last day of September General Beatson, with his Chief of
Staff and military Secretary, left the Dardanelles for ever. Arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
at Buyukdere, a report was sent to General Vivian, and he presently
came on board, where a lengthened communication passed between
the Generals. Rumours of a Russian attack had induced a most
conciliatory tone. General Vivian appeared satisfied with the
explanation, and listened favourably to General Beatson's urgent
request for permission to return at once to the Dardanelles. He
asked expressly if the "Buzouker" could keep his men in order.
The answer was a <i>decided affirmative</i>, which appeared to have
considerable weight with him, and he expressed great regret for
having, under a false impression, written an unfavourable letter to
Lord Panmure, the tone of whose correspondence had been most
offensive. He stated, however, that nothing could be done without
the order of her Majesty's Ambassador; and, promising to call upon
him for instructions, he left the steamer about midday, declaring
that he would return in the course of the afternoon. After a few
hours appeared, instead of General Vivian, a stiff official letter,
directed to General Beatson. The interview with Lord Stratford
had completely altered the tone of his official conduct.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October General Beatson reported officially to
Lords Panmure and Stratford the efficient state of his force, concerning
which General Smith had written most favourably. An equally favourable
view was expressed in the public press by that Prince of War
Correspondents, William H. Russell, whose name in those days was
quoted by every Englishman. General Beatson begged to be sent
on service, offering, upon his own responsibility, to take up transports,
and to embark his men for Eupatoria, Yinikali, Batum,
Balaclava, or&mdash;that unhappy Kars. To this no reply was returned.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained to be done, and on the 18th of October
we left Therapia <i>en route</i> to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Beatsons_Trial"></a>Beatson's Trial.</i></div>

<p>The sequel to this affair was sufficiently remarkable. General
Beatson came home and attempted to take civil proceedings against
his enemies. Chief amongst them was Mr. Skene&mdash;one of the
Consuls already referred to&mdash;who, from the inception of General
Beatson's scheme, had shown himself most bitterly opposed to it,
and who had used all his influence to make General Beatson's
position untenable.</p>

<p>Afterwards he chose to say that, "when General Smith arrived
at the Dardanelles, General Beatson assembled the Commanding
Officers of the regiments, and actually endeavoured to persuade
them to make a mutiny in the regiments against General Smith,
and against the authority of Vivian. Two of these Commanding
Officers then left the room, saying they were soldiers, and they could
not listen to language which they thought most improper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
mutinous. These two were Lieut.-Colonels O'Reilly and Shirley.
General Beatson subsequently had a sort of round robin prepared
by the Chief Interpreter, and sent round to the different officers,
in the hope that they would sign it, refusing to serve under any
other General than himself. Both of these mutinous attempts are
said to have originated from Captain Burton, who it also appears
kept the order from Lord Panmure, placing the Irregular Horse
under Lieut.-General Vivian, for three whole weeks unknown to
any one but General Beatson, and the order was not promulgated
until after General Smith had arrived."</p>

<p>General Beatson went into the witness-box and categorically denied
the charges made against him.<a name="FNanchor_3_91" id="FNanchor_3_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_91" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I followed and gave evidence to
the same effect, as did also General Watt; but there was a great
difficulty in proving the publication of the libel, the War Office, then
represented by Mr. Sidney Herbert, refusing to produce certain
letters. Mr. Skene was very ably defended by Mr. Bovill (afterwards
Lord Chief Justice), Mr. Lush (afterwards a judge), and Mr. Garth,
and he brought forward a considerable number of witnesses, including
General Vivian himself. Their evidence, however, tended rather to
establish the case against him (Skene), so that he was compelled to plead
that his libel was a privileged communication. Mr. Baron Bramwell
confined himself in his summing-up strictly to the legal aspects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the case, but he allowed his view of Mr. Skene's conduct to be very
distinctly understood.</p>

<p>The jury (a special one), after half an hour's deliberation,
returned a verdict for the defendant on the technical ground,
but added a rider to their verdict, expressive of their disgust at
Mr. Skene for having refrained from retracting his charges against
General Beatson when he found how utterly without foundation they
were. The verdict of the jury was confirmed on appeal, but it was
generally felt that General Beatson had fully vindicated his character,
and had very successfully exposed the conspiracy against the
Irregulars, which had ended so disastrously for him and for his
officers. The characters of the plaintiff and the defendant respectively
may be estimated from one small circumstance. Beatson
began his action just as the Indian Mutiny broke out, and being
reasonably refused an extension of leave for the purpose of prosecuting
it, went out to India. When the Mutiny was suppressed he
obtained six months' leave, without pay, for the purpose of prosecuting
his case. Mr. Skene had obtained the appointment of Consul at
Aleppo, and could have reached England in a fortnight, but he
chose to remain at his Consulate, though there would have been no
difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on full pay. Under such
circumstances, it was perhaps hardly worth while for his counsel to
dwell upon the cruelty of pushing on this case in his absence, a
complaint for which the presiding judge somewhat emphatically
declared <i>that there was not the smallest foundation</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_91" id="Footnote_3_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_91"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Richard was not altogether lucky, as far as promotion went, about his Chiefs.
Sir Charles Napier had seen what stuff he was made of, and had utilized and
praised him to the utmost, but Napier's patronage was not in those days a recommendation,
because he was always fighting some big-wig at home, and high
officials who are ruffled up are quite as dangerous as fighting Sikhs or Afghans.
He then served under General Beatson, who, like Napier, was always plunging into
hot water; but Richard was devoted to his Chiefs, who well deserved his loyalty,
and in this instance Richard gave valuable evidence on his old Commander's
behalf. He was very amusing in the witness-box; he was so cool and ready, and
always worried his cross-examiner into a white heat of rage, playing with him as
a cat does a mouse, when the lawyer was doing his best to bewilder him, and
make him contradict himself, especially when Richard got him into a network of
military terms, the cross-examiner being rather at sea among its technicalities. I
can see him now, just as he used to be in the fencing school; he would play with
his adversary, just as if he was carving a chicken, and tire him out long before the
real play began, so that an ill-tempered man would almost spit himself with rage,
if the button had not been on.
</p>
<p>
It was good to see him under cross-examination. Bovill, subsequently Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, was leading counsel on the other side, and was
so ill-advised as to attempt to browbeat Richard. His failure was naturally
disastrous. A very simple answer of Richard's quite upset Bovill. "In what
regiment did you serve under the plaintiff?" "Eh?" "In what regiment, I
say&mdash;&mdash;" "In no regiment." After playing with counsel for a minute or two,
Richard let him know that he had served in a "corps." Bovill was still further
discomfited in the course of the trial, by a manœuvre of Edwin James, who was
managing Beatson's case. James coolly got up while Bovill was speaking for the
defence, declared he could not stay and listen to such stuff, and left the court
for a while. It is only fair to add that Bovill won the case.&mdash;I. B.</p>

<p>As soon as Richard was well home from the Crimea, and had
attended Beatson's trial, he began to turn his attention to the "Unveiling
of Isis," in other words, "Discovering the sources of the Nile,
the Lake Regions of Central Africa," on which his heart had long
been set, and he passed most of his time in London working it up.</p>

<p>One summer day, in August, 1856, thirty-seven years ago, we had
not gone out of town, and I was walking in the Botanical Gardens
with my sister, Blanche Pigott, and a friend, and Richard was there,
walking with the gorgeous creature of Boulogne&mdash;then married. We
immediately stopped and shook hands, and asked each other a
thousand questions of the four intervening years, and all the old
Boulogne memories and feelings which had lain dormant, but not
extinct, returned to me. He asked me before I left if I came very
often to the Botanical Gardens, and I said, "Oh yes, we always
come and read and study here from eleven to one, because it is
so much nicer than staying in the hot rooms at this season."'
"That is quite right," he said. "What are you studying?" I
had that day with me an old friend, Disraeli's "Tancred," the book
of my heart and tastes, which he explained to me. We were there
about an hour, and when I had to leave, as I moved off, I heard
him say to his companion, "Do you know that your cousin has
grown charming? I would not have believed that the little schoolgirl
of Boulogne would have become such a sweet girl;" and I heard
her say, "Ugh!" with a tone of disgust.</p>

<p>Next day, when we got there, he was also there&mdash;alone&mdash;composing
poetry to show to Monckton-Milnes on some pet subject, and he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
forward, saying laughingly, "You won't chalk up 'Mother will be
angry' now, will you, as you did when you were a little girl?" Again
we walked and talked. This went on for a fortnight&mdash;I trod on air.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_become_engaged"></a>We become engaged.</i></div>

<p>At the end of a fortnight he asked me "if I could dream of
doing anything so sickly as to give up Civilization, and if he could
obtain the Consulate at Damascus, to go and live there." He said,
"Don't give me an answer <i>now</i>, because it will mean a very serious
step for you&mdash;no less than giving up your people, and all that you
are used to, and living the sort of life that Lady Hester Stanhope
led. I see the capabilities in you, but you must think it over." I
was so long silent from emotion&mdash;it was just as if the moon had
tumbled down and said, "I thought you cried for me, so I came"&mdash;that
he thought I was thinking worldly thoughts, and said, "Forgive
me! I ought not to have asked so much." At last I found my voice,
and said, "I don't <i>want</i> to 'think it over'&mdash;I have been 'thinking
it over' for six years, ever since I first saw you at Boulogne on the
Ramparts. I have prayed for you every day, morning and night. I
have followed all your career minutely. I have read every word you
ever wrote, and I would rather have a crust and a tent with <i>you</i> than
be Queen of all the world. And so I say now, Yes! <span class="smcap">Yes!</span> YES!" I
will pass over the next few minutes. Then he said, "Your people
will not give you to me." I answered, "I know that, but I belong
to myself&mdash;I give myself away." "That is all right," he answered;
"be firm, and so shall I."</p>

<p>After that he came and visited a little at our house as an acquaintance,
having been introduced at Boulogne, and he fascinated,
amused, and pleasantly shocked my mother, but completely magnetized
my father and all my brothers and sisters. My father used
to say, "I don't know what it is about that man, but I can't get
him out of my head, I dream about <i>him every night</i>."</p>

<p>Cardinal Wiseman and Richard had become friends in early days.
Languages had brought them together, and the Cardinal now furnished
him with a special passport, recommending him to all the
Catholic Missions in wild places all over the World, with special
letters describing him as a Catholic Officer.</p>

<p>I now think I must introduce to you two cuttings from the
<i>Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society</i>. The first was an obituary after
his death, January, 1891; the other was a small contribution from
me, throwing a light on his Gypsy interests, and this will explain
better than any other way why I was so impressed on hearing his
name when we were introduced, and why I was so startled at his
pursuit and mingling with the Jats, the aboriginal Gypsies in India,
mentioned in my Boulogne recital.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Obituary in the "Gypsy Lore Society Journal," January,</span>
1891.</h4>


<p>"Not only this Society, but the whole civilized world, has recently
had to mourn the death of our distinguished fellow-member, Sir
Richard Francis Burton. Of the many events of his eventful life it
is needless to speak here. As soldier, explorer, linguist, and man of
letters (the writer of about eighty more or less bulky volumes), he
made himself separately famous. 'His most famed achievement&mdash;the
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina in the character of an Afghan
Muslim&mdash;was,' says one writer, 'an achievement of the first order.
To consider it without a wondering admiration is impossible: so vast
is the amount involved of hardihood and self-confidence, of linguistic
skill and histrionic genius, of resourcefulness and vigilance and
resolve.'</p>

<p>"But the aspect in which he may most suitably be regarded in
these pages, is that of a student of the Gypsies, to whom he was
affiliated by nature, if not actually by right of descent.</p>

<p>"Whether there may not be also a tinge of Arab, or, perhaps, of
Gypsy blood in Burton's race, is a point which is perhaps open to
question. For the latter suspicion an excuse may be found in the
incurable restlessness which has beset him since his infancy, a restlessness
which has effectually prevented him from ever settling long
in any one place, and in the singular idiosyncrasy which his friends
have often remarked&mdash;the peculiarity of his eyes. 'When it (the eye)
looks at you,' said one who knows him well, 'it looks through you,
and then, glazing over, seems to see something behind you. Richard
Burton is the only man (not a Gypsy) with that peculiarity, and he
shares with them the same horror of a corpse, death-bed scenes, and
graveyards, though caring little for his own life.' When to this
remarkable fact he added the scarcely less interesting detail that
'Burton' is one of the half-dozen distinctively Romany names, it is
evident that the suspicion of Sir Richard Burton having a drop
of Gypsy blood in his descent&mdash;crossed and commingled though
it be with an English, Scottish, French, and Irish strain&mdash;is not
altogether unreasonable.</p>

<p>"Unreasonable or not, it can hardly be said that this constitutes a
firm basis on which to rear a theory of Gypsy lineage. Yet Burton
himself acknowledged a certain Gypsy connection, though, it will be
noticed, he does not say the affinity was that of blood, in the following
extract from a letter to Mr. J. Pincherle, accepting that gentleman's
dedication of his Romany version of the 'Song of Songs' (<i>I
Ghiléngheri Ghilia Salomuneskero</i>). 'Dear Mr. Pincherle,' writes
Sir Richard, 'I accept the honour of your dedication with the same
frankness with which you accompanied its offer. And indeed, I am
not wholly dissociated from this theme; there is an important family
of Gypsies in foggy England, who, in very remote times, adopted our
family name. I am yet on very friendly terms with several of these
strange people; nay, a certain Hagar Burton, an old fortune-teller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
(<i>divinatrice</i>), took part in a period of my life which in no small
degree contributed to determine its course.'</p>

<p>"Whether such slight indications as these really point to a Gypsy
line of descent or not, there can be no question as to the interest
which Sir Richard Burton took in Gypsy lore. Apart from his
various well-known published accounts of the Jats and other tribes of
the Indus Valley, he had a work specially entitled 'The Gypsies,'
which his biography of 1887 announces as then 'in course of preparation.'
The materials of this work are now, we understand, in the
possession of Lady Burton, and we trust that they will some day see
the light. Sir Richard was himself one of the original members of
the Gypsy Lore Society, in which he always took a deep interest; and
a letter which he wrote to the secretary, only five days before his
death, concludes with the good wish&mdash;'All luck to the Society; I
will not fail to do what little I can.'</p>

<p>"His death, which was very sudden, took place on October 20th
last, while he still held the office of British Consul at Trieste. The
high esteem in which he was held by the citizens of Trieste, not only
on account of his official position and the great name which he had
made for himself in the world of science, but also for those personal
qualities which had won their regard, is amply testified by the sincere
expressions of regret which accompanied the last honours there paid
to his memory. At the time of his death Sir Richard Burton was
sixty-nine years of age, having been born at Barham House, Hertfordshire,
on March 19th, 1821."</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">An Episode from the Life of Sir Richard Burton,
by his Wife.</span></h4>


<p>"In our obituary notice of the late Sir Richard Burton, mention
was made of a certain Gypsy named Hagar Burton, who, Sir Richard
stated, had been instrumental, to some extent, in shaping his destiny.
This reference has been fully explained by Lady Burton, who, in
favouring us with some account of her illustrious husband, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'In the January number of the <i>Gypsy Lore Journal</i> a passage
is quoted from "a short sketch of the career" of my husband (a
little black pamphlet) which half suspects a remote drop of Gypsy
blood in him. There is no proof that this was ever the case, but
there is no question that he showed many of their peculiarities in
appearance, disposition, and speech&mdash;speaking Romany like themselves.
Nor did we ever enter a Gypsy camp without their claiming
him: "What are you doing with a black coat on?" they would say,
"why don't you join us and be our King?"</p>

<p>"'He had the peculiar eye, which looked you through, glazed over
and saw something behind, and is the only man, not a Gypsy,
with that peculiarity. He had the restlessness which could stay
nowhere long, nor own any spot on earth&mdash;the same horror of a
corpse, death-bed scenes, and graveyards, or anything which was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the slightest degree ghoulish, though caring but little for his own life&mdash;the
same aptitude for reading the hand at a glance. With many,
he would drop it at once and turn away, nor would anything induce
him to speak a word about it.</p>

<p>"'You quote a letter of his to Mr. James Pincherle, a dear old
friend of ours, where he relates the influence that a Gypsy, named
Hagar Burton, had upon his life. I will now tell you the story, which
will reappear in his biography, if I live to finish it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Hagar_Burton_the_Gipsy"></a>Hagar Burton the Gipsy.</i></div>

<p>"'When I was a girl in the schoolroom in the country, I was
enthusiastic about Gypsies, Bedouin Arabs, everything Eastern and
mysterious, and especially wild, lawless life. Disraeli's "Tancred"
was my second Bible. I was strictly forbidden to associate with the
Gypsies in our lanes, which was my delight. When they were only
travelling tinkers or basket-menders I was very obedient, but wild
horses would not have kept me out of the camps of the Oriental, yet
English-named, tribes of Burton, Cooper, Stanley, Osbaldiston, and
one other whose name I forget. My particular friend was Hagar Burton,
a tall, slender, handsome, distinguished, refined woman, of much weight
in the tribe. Many an hour have I passed with her (she called me
Daisy), and many a little service I did them when any of them were
sick, or had got into a scrape with the squires, anent poultry or eggs
and other things. At last a time came when we were to go to school
in France, and my departure was regretted by them. The last day
but one I ever saw Hagar, she cast my horoscope, and wrote it in
Romany. The rest of the tribe presented me with a straw flycatcher
of many colours, which I still have. The horoscope was translated
to me by her, and I give you the most important part concerning my
husband&mdash;</p>

<p>"'"You will cross the sea, and be in the same town with your
Destiny, and know it not. Every obstacle will rise up against you,
and such a combination of circumstances, that it will require all your
courage and energy and intelligence to meet them. Your life will
be like one always swimming against big waves, but God will always
be with you, so you will always win. You will fix your eye on your
polar star, and you will go for that without looking right or left.
<i>You will bear the name of our Tribe, and be right proud of it. You
will be as we are, but far greater than we.</i> Your life is all wandering,
change, and adventure. One soul in two bodies, in life or death;
never long apart. Show this to the man you take for your husband.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hagar
Burton</span>."</p>

<p>"'In June, 1856, I went to Ascot. I met Hagar and shook hands
with her. "Are you Daisy Burton yet?" was her first question. I
shook my head&mdash;"Would to God I were!" Her face lit up. "Patience,
it is just coming." She waved her hand, being rudely thrust from the
carriage. I never saw her since, but I was engaged to Richard two
months later.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Strange_Parting"></a>Our Strange Parting.</i></div>

<p>"'After we were engaged, I gave him the horoscope in Romany.
It was before he set out in October, 1856, with Speke, for the discovery
of Tanganyika. We had been engaged for some weeks.
One day in October we had passed several hours together, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
appointed to come next day, at four o'clock in the afternoon. I went
to bed quite happy, but I could not sleep at all. At two a.m. the
door opened, and he came into my room. A current of warm air
came towards my bed. He said, "Good-bye, my poor child. My
time is up, and I have gone, but do not grieve. I shall be back in
less than three years, and <i>I am your destiny</i>. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"'He held up a letter&mdash;looked long at me with those Gypsy eyes,
and went slowly out, shutting the door. I sprang out of bed to the
door, into the passage&mdash;there was nothing&mdash;and thence into the room
of one of my brothers. I threw myself on the ground, and cried
my heart out. He got up, asked me what ailed me, and tried to
soothe and comfort me. "Richard is gone to Africa," I said, "and
I shall not see him for three years." "Nonsense," he replied; "you
have only got a nightmare. You told me he was coming at four in
the afternoon." "So I did; but I have seen him, and he told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
this; and if you wait till the post comes in, you will see I have told
you truly." I sat all the night in my brother's armchair, and at eight
o'clock, when the post came in, there was a letter to my sister,
Blanche Pigott, enclosing one for me. "He had found it too painful
to part, and had thought we should suffer less that way, begged her
to break it gently to me, and to give me the letter" (which assured
me we should be reunited in 1859&mdash;as we were, on the 22nd May of
that year). He had left London at six o'clock the previous evening,
eight hours before I saw him in the night.</p>

<p>"'This is the story of Hagar Burton. We have mixed a great deal
since with Gypsies, in all parts of the world, and have sought her in
vain. The other Gypsies have chiefly warned us of having to fight
through our lives, and to be perpetually on guard against treacheries
and calumnies "<i>chiefly through jealous men and nasty women</i>." Well,
we have mostly left them to God, and they nearly always come to
grief. I may add that all that Hagar Burton foretold came true, and
I pray God it may be so to the end, <i>i.e.</i> "never long apart" in Life
<i>or</i> Death.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton</span>.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard traced for me a little sketch of what he expected to find
in the Lake Regions (see below).</p>

<p>That last afternoon I had placed round his neck a medal of
the Blessed Virgin upon a steel chain, which we Catholics commonly
call "the miraculous medal." He promised me he would
wear it throughout his journey, and show it me on his return. I had
offered it to him on a gold chain, but he had said, "Take away
the gold chain; they will cut my throat for it out there." He did
show it me round his neck when he came back; he wore it all his
life, and it is buried with him.</p>

<p>What made my position more painful was, that he knew that I
should not be allowed to receive any letters from him, and therefore
it was not safe to write often, and then only to say what others might
read. He left to me, at my request, the task of breaking the fact of
my engagement to my people, when, where, and how I pleased, as it
would be impossible to marry me until he came back. I would here
insert a little poem he wrote on leaving&mdash;</p>

<h4>HIS EXPLORATION OF THE LAKE REGIONS, TAKING CAPTAIN SPEKE
AS SECOND IN COMMAND.</h4>


<h4><span class="smcap">My Foreword.</span></h4>


<p>It was the Royal Geographical Society which induced Lord
Clarendon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to supply Richard
with funds for an exploration of the then utterly unknown Lake
Regions of Central Africa. In October, 1856, he set out for
Bombay, applied for Captain Speke, and landed at Zanzibar on
December 19th, 1856. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, her Majesty's
Consul at Zanzibar, was very good to them; they made a tentative
expedition from January 5th to March 6th, 1857, about the Mombas
regions. They got a bad coast fever, and returned to Zanzibar.
They then set out again into the far interior, into which only one
European, Monsieur Maizan, a French naval officer, had attempted
to penetrate; he was cruelly murdered at the outset of his journey.</p>

<p>It was the first successful attempt to penetrate that country, and
laid the foundation for others. It was the base on which all subsequent
journeys were founded; Livingstone, Cameron, Speke and
Grant, Sir S. Baker, and Stanley carried it out. Where Richard
found the rudest barbarians, Church missions have been established,
and commerce, and now a railway is proposed to connect the coast
with the Lake Regions. This expedition brought neither honour
nor profit to Richard; but the world is not likely to forget it; the
future will be more generous and juster than the past or present.
During these African explorations, Richard was attacked by fever
twenty-one times, by temporary paralysis and partial blindness. On
his return he brought out "The Lake Regions of Equatorial Africa,"
2 vols., 1860, and the Royal Geographical Society devoted the
whole of their thirty-third volume to its recital (Clowes and Son).
Richard's book was translated into French by Madame H. Loreau,
and republished in New York by Fakir, 1861. It will shortly be
added to the Uniform Library in preparation. In May, 1859, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
moment he returned to England, he immediately proposed another
Expedition, which, however, the Royal Geographical Society gave to
his disloyal companion, who completely and wilfully spoiled the first
Expedition as far as lay in his power.</p>

<p>"Of the gladdest moments, methinks, in human life, is the departing
upon a distant journey into <i>unknown</i> lands. Shaking off with
one effort the fetters of habit, the leaden weight of routine, the
cloak of carking care, and the slavery of Civilization, Man feels once
more happy. The blood flows with the fast circulation of youth,
excitement gives a new vigour to the muscles, and a sense of sudden
freedom adds an inch to the stature. Afresh dawns the morn of life,
again the bright world is beautiful to the eye, and the glorious face of
Nature gladdens the soul. A journey, in fact, appeals to Imagination,
to Memory, to Hope&mdash;the sister Graces of our moral being.</p>

<p>"The shrill screaming of the boatswain's whistle, and sundry
shouts of, 'Stand by yer booms!' 'All ready, for'ard?' 'Now
make sail!' sounded in mine ears with a sweet significance.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Zanzibar.</span></h4>


<p>"Our captain decided, from the absence of Friday flags on the
Consular Staffs, that some great man had gone to his long home.
The <i>Elphinstone</i>, however, would not have the trouble of casting
loose her guns for nothing with H.H. the Sayyid of Zanzibar's
ensign&mdash;a plain red&mdash;at the fore, and the Union at the main, she cast
anchor in Front Bay, about half a mile from shore, and fired a salute
of twenty-one. A gay bunting thereupon flew up to every truck, and
the brass cannon of the <i>Victoria</i> roared a response of twenty-two.
We had arrived on the fortieth, or the last day of mourning.</p>

<p>"When 'chivalry' was explained to the late ruler, Said of Zanzibar
(1856), as enlightened a prince as Arabia ever produced, and surrounded
by intrigue, he was shrewd enough to remark 'that only
the <i>siflah</i> (low fellows) interfere between husband and wife.'</p>

<p>"Peace to his soul! he was a model of Arab princes, a firm
friend to the English nation, and a great admirer of the 'Malikat el
Aazameh,' our most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>"The unworthy merchants of Zanzibar, American and European,
did their best to secure for us the fate of M. Maizan, both on this
and on a subsequent occasion, by spreading all manner of reports
amongst the Banyans, Arabs, and Sawahilis.</p>

<p>"Considering the unfitness of the season, we were strongly advised
to defer exploration of the interior until we had learned something of
the coast, and for that purpose we set out at once, for a two or three
months' cruise.</p>

Consul and H.E.I. Co.'s agent at the court of H.H. Sayyid Said,
and directed to make this island his Head-quarters, Colonel Hamerton
found that for nine years not a British cruiser had visited it, and
that report declared us to be no longer Masters of the Indian seas.
Slavery was rampant. Wretches were thrown overboard, when sick,
to prevent paying duty; and the sea-beach before the town, as well
as the plantations, presented horrible spectacles of dogs devouring
human flesh. The Consul's representations were accepted by Sayyid
Said; sundry floggings and confiscation of property instilled into
slave-owners the semblance of humanity. The insolence of the
negro was as summarily dealt with. The Arabs had persuaded
the Sawahilis and blacks that a white man is a being below contempt,
and the 'poor African' carries out the theory. Only
seventeen years have elapsed since an American Trader-Consul, in
consular cocked hat and sword, was horsed upon a slave's back, and
solemnly 'bakered' in his own consular house, under his own consular
flag. A Sawahili would at any time enter the merchant's
bureau, dispose his sandalled feet upon the table, call for a cognac,
and if refused, draw his dagger. Negro fishermen would anchor
their craft close to a window, and, clinging to the mast, enjoy the
novel spectacle of Kafirs feeding.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> an Englishman here is even more civilly treated than at
one of our Presidencies. This change is the work of Colonel
Hamerton, who, in the strenuous and unremitting discharge of his
duties, has lost youth, strength, and health. The iron constitution
of this valuable public servant&mdash;I have quoted merely a specimen of
his worth&mdash;has been undermined by the terrible fever, and at fifty
his head bears the 'blossoms of the grave,' as though it had seen its
seventieth summer.</p>

<p>"The reader asks, What induced us to take a guide apparently so
little fit for rough-and-ready work? In the first place, the presence
of Said bin Salim el Lamki was a pledge of respectability. And
lastly, a bright exception to the rule of his unconscientious race, he
<i>appears</i> truthful, honest, and honourable. I have never yet had
reason to suspect him of a low action. 'Verily,' was the reply,
'whoso benefiteth the beneficent becometh his Lord; but the vile
well-treated turneth and rendeth thee.' I almost hope that he may
not deceive us in the end.</p>

<p>"The traveller in Eastern Africa must ever be prepared for three
distinct departures&mdash;the little start, the great start, and the start.</p>

<p>"On the 10th of January we ran through the paradise of verdant
banks and plateaus, forming the approach to Pemba,<a name="FNanchor_1_92" id="FNanchor_1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_92" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and halted a
day to admire the Emerald Isle of these Eastern seas. In A.D. 1698
the bold buccaneer, Captain Kidd, buried there his blood-stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
hoards of precious stones and metal, the plunder of India and the
further Orient. The people of Pemba have found pots full of gold
lumps, probably moulded from buttons that the pirate might wear
his wealth.</p>

<p>"On the heights of Chhaga, an image or statue of a long-haired
woman, seated in a chair and holding a child, is reported to remain.
Iconolatry being here unknown, the savages must have derived them
from some more civilized race&mdash;Catholic missionaries.</p>

<p>"The Mazrui, a noble Arab tribe, placed themselves under
British protection in their rebellion against the late Sayyid. They
were permitted to fly our flag&mdash;a favour for which, when danger
disappeared, they proved themselves ungrateful; and a Mr. Reece
was placed at Mombas to watch its interests. The travellers lamented
that we abandoned Mombas: had England retained it, the whole
interior would now be open to us. But such is the history of
Britain the Great: hard won by blood and gold, her conquests are
parted with for a song.</p>

<p>"The very Hindús required a lesson in civility. With the <i>Wali</i>,
or Governor, Khalfan bin Ali, an Omani Arab of noble family, we
were on the best of terms. But the manifest animus of the public
made us feel light-hearted, when, our inquiries concluded, we bade
adieu to Mombas.</p>

<p>"The people of Eastern Intertropical Africa are divided by their
occupations into three orders. First is the fierce pastoral nomad,
the Galla and Masai, the Somal and the Kafir, who lives upon the
produce of his cattle, the chase, and foray. Secondly rank the
semi-pastoral, as the Wakamba, who, though without fixed abodes,
make their women cultivate the ground. And the last degree of
civilization, agriculture, is peculiar to the Waníka, the Wasumbára,
and the various tribes living between the coast and the interior lakes.</p>

<p>"The Waníka, or Desert race, is composed of a Negritic base,
now intimately mixed with Semitic blood.</p>

<p>"When that enlightened Arab statesman, H.E. Ali bin Nasir,
H.H. the Imaum of Muscat's Envoy Extraordinary to H.B.
Majesty, was Governor of Mombas, he took advantage of a scarcity
to feed the starving Waníka from the public granaries. He was
careful, however, to secure as pledges of repayment, the wives and
children of his debtors, and he lost no time in selling off the whole
number. Such a feat was probably little suspected by our countrymen,
when, to honour enlightened beneficence, they welcomed the
Statesman with all the triumphs of Exeter Hall, presented him with
costly specimens of Government, and sent him from Aden to
Zanzibar in the H.E.I. Co.'s brig of war <i>Tigris</i>. This Oriental votary
of free trade came to a merited end. Recognized by the enraged
savages, he saw his sons expire in torments; he was terribly mutilated
during life, and was put to death with all the refinements of cruelty.</p>

<p>"A report, prevalent in Mombas&mdash;even a Sawahili sometimes
speaks the truth&mdash;and the march of an armed party from the town
which denoted belief in their own words, induced my companions
and myself to hasten up once more to the Rabai Hills, expecting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
find the mission-house invested by savages. The danger had been
exaggerated, but the inmates were strongly advised to take temporary
shelter in the town. Left Kisulodiny on the 22nd of January, 1857.
Some nights afterwards, fires were observed upon the neighbouring
hills, and Waníka scouts returned with a report that the Masai were
in rapid advance. The wise few fled at once to the <i>kaza</i>, or hidden
and barricaded stronghold, which these people prepare for extreme
danger. The foolish many said, 'To-morrow morning we will drive
our flocks and herds to safety.' But ere that morning dawned upon
the world, a dense mass of wild spearmen, sweeping with shout and
yell, and clashing arms, by the mission-house, which they either
saw not or they feared to enter, dashed upon the scattered villages
in the vale below, and left the ground strewed with the corpses of
hapless fugitives. When driving off their cattle, the Masai, rallying,
fell upon them, drove them away in ignominious flight, and slew
twenty-five of their number.</p>

<p>"Jack<a name="FNanchor_2_93" id="FNanchor_2_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_93" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and I landed at Wasin, and found the shore crowded with
a mob of unarmed gazers, who did not even return our salaams: we
resolved in future to keep such greetings for those who deserved
them. Abd-el-Karím led us to his house, seated us in chairs upon
a terrace, and mixed a cooling drink in a vase not usually devoted
to such purpose. There is no game on the island, or on the main.
In the evening we quitted the squalid settlement without a single
regret.</p>

<p>"Our <i>nakhoda</i> again showed symptoms of trickery; he had
been allowed to ship cargo from Mombas to Wasin, and, Irish-like,
he thereupon founded a right to ship cargo from Wasin to Tanga.
Unable to disabuse his mind by mild proceedings, I threatened to
cut the cable.</p>

<p>"At last, having threaded the <i>báb</i>, or narrow rock-bound passage
which separates the bluff headland of Tanga Island from Ras Rashíd
on the main, we glided into the bay, and anchored in three fathoms
of water, opposite, and about half a mile from, the town.</p>

<p>"Tanga Bay extends six miles deep by five in breadth. The
entrance is partially barred by a coralline bank, the ancient site of
the Arab settlement.</p>

<p>"We landed on the morning of the 27th of January, and were
met upon the sea-shore, in absence of the Arab Governor, by the
<i>Diwans</i> or Sawahili Headmen, the <i>Jemadar</i> and his Belochies, the
Collector of customs, Mizan Sahib, a daft old Indian, and other
dignitaries. They conducted us to the hut formerly tenanted by
M. Erhardt; brought coffee, fruit, and milk; and, in fine, treated
us with peculiar civility. Here Sheddad built his City of brass, and
encrusted the hill-top with a silver dome that shines with various
and surpassing colours.</p>

<p>"The mountain recedes as the traveller advances, and the higher
he ascends the higher rises the summit. At last blood bursts from
the nostrils, the fingers bend backwards, and the most adventurous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
is fain to stop. Amongst this Herodotian tissue of fact and fable,
ran one fine thread of truth: all testified to the intense cold.</p>

<p>"They promised readily, however, to escort me to one of the
ancient Cities of the coast.</p>

<p>"Setting out at eight a.m. with a small party of spearmen, I walked
four or five miles south of Tanga, on the Tangata road, over
a country strewed with the bodies of huge millepedes, and dry as
Arabian sand.</p>

<p>"I assumed an Arab dress&mdash;a turban of portentous circumference,
and a long henna-dyed shirt&mdash;and, accompanied by Said bin Salim,
I went to inspect the scene.</p>

<p>"The wild people, Washenzy, Wasembára, Wadígo, and Waségeju,
armed as usual, stalking about, whilst their women, each with baby
on back, carried heavy loads of saleable stuff, or sat opposite their
property, or chaffered and gesticulated upon knotty questions of
bargain.</p>

<p>"The heat of the ground made my barefooted companions run
forward to the shade, from time to time, like the dogs in Tibet.
Sundry excursions delayed us six days at Tanga.</p>

<p>"Five hours of lazy sailing ran us into Tangata, an open road
between Tanga and Pangany. Here we delayed a day to inspect
some ruins, where we had been promised Persian inscriptions and
other wonders.</p>

<p>"We spent the remainder of the day and night at Tangata,
fanned by the north-east breeze, and cradled by the rocking send of
the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>"At five a.m. on the 3rd of February we hoisted sail, and slipped
down with the tepid morning breeze to Pangany, sighting Maziny
Island, its outpost, after three hours' run. Soon after arrival I sent Said
bin Salim, in all his bravery, on shore with the Sayyid of Zanzibar's
circular letter to the <i>Wali</i> or Governor, to the <i>Jemadar</i>, to the
Collector of customs, and the different <i>Diwans</i>. All this preparation
for a mere trifle! We were received with high honour. The <i>Diwans</i>
danced an ancient military dance before us with the pomp and circumstance
of drawn swords, whilst bare-headed slave-girls, with hair
<i>à la Brutus</i>, sang and flapped their skirts over the ground, with
an affectedly modest and downcast demeanour. After half an hour's
endurance, we were led into the upper-storied house of the Wali
Meriko, a freedman of the late Sayyid Said, and spent the evening
in a committee of ways and means.</p>

<p>"African villages are full of bleared misery by day, and animated
filth by night, and of hunting adventures and hair-breadth escapes,
lacking the interest of catastrophe.</p>

<p>"We arose early in the morning after arrival at Pangany, and
repaired to the terrace for the better enjoyment of the view.</p>

<p>"If it had half-a-dozen white kiosks, minarets, and latticed summer-houses,
it would almost rival that gem of creation, the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>"The settlement is surrounded by a thorny jungle, which at times
harbours a host of leopards. One of these beasts lately scaled the
high terrace of our house, and seized upon a slave-girl. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
master, the burly black <i>Wali</i>, who was sleeping by her side, gallantly
caught up his sword, ran into the house, and bolted the door,
heedless of the miserable cry, 'B'ana, help me!' The wretch was
carried to the jungle and devoured. The river is equally full of
alligators, and whilst we were at Pangany a boy disappeared.</p>

<p>"Of course the two tribes, Wasumbara and Wazegura, are deadly
foes. Moreover, about a year ago, a violent intestine feud broke
out amongst the Wazegura, who, at the time of our visit, were
burning and murdering, kidnapping, and slave-selling in all
directions.</p>

<p>"The timid townsmen had also circulated a report that we were
bound for Chhaga and Kilimanjaro: the Masai were 'out,' the rains
were setting in, and they saw with us no armed escort. They
resolved therefore not to accompany us.</p>

<p>"With abundance of money&mdash;say not less than £5000 per annum&mdash;an
exploring party can trace its own line, pay the exactions of
all Chiefs; it can study whatever is requisite; handle sextants in
presence of negroes, who would cut every throat for one inch of
brass; and, by travelling in comfort, can secure a very fair chance
of return. Even from Mombas or from Pangany, with an escort of
one hundred matchlock-men, we might have marched through the
Masai plunderers to Chhaga and Kilimanjaro. But pay, porterage,
and provisions for such a party would have amounted to at least £100
per week; a month and a half would have absorbed our means.
Thus it was, gentle reader, that we were compelled to rest contented
with a visit on foot to Fuga, for we had only one thousand pounds.</p>

<p>"Presently the plot thickened. Muigni Khatib, son of Sultan
Kimwere, a black of most unprepossessing physiognomy, with a
'villanous trick of the eye, and a foolish hanging of the nether lip,'
a prognathous jaw, garnished with cat-like moustaches and cobweb
beard, a sour frown, and abundant surliness by way of dignity,
dressed like an Arab, and raised by El Islam above his fellows, sent
a message directing us to place in his hands what we intended for
his father. This Chief was travelling to Zanzibar in fear and
trembling. He had tried to establish at his village, Kirore, a
Romulian asylum for runaway slaves, and, having partially succeeded,
he dreaded the consequences. The Beloch <i>Jemadar</i> strongly urged
us privily to cause his detention at the islands, a precaution somewhat
too Oriental for our tastes. We refused, however, the <i>muigni's</i>
demand in his own tone. Following their Prince, the dancing
<i>Diwans</i> claimed a fee for permission to reside; as they worded it,
'<i>el adah</i>'&mdash;the habit; based upon an ancient present from Colonel
Hamerton; and were in manifest process of establishing a local
custom which, in Africa, becomes law to remotest posterity. We
flatly objected, showed our letters, and in the angriest of moods
threatened reference to Zanzibar. Briefly, all began to beg bakhshish;
but I cannot remember any one obtaining it.</p>

<p>"Weary of these importunities, we resolved to visit Chogway, a
Beloch outpost, and thence, aided by the <i>Jemadar</i> who had preceded
us from Pangany, to push for the capital village of Usumbara. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
made preparations secretly, dismissed the 'Riami,' rejected the
<i>Diwans</i> who wished to accompany us as spies, left Said bin Salim and
one Portuguese to watch our property in the house of Meriko, the
Governor, who had accompanied his <i>muigni</i> to Zanzibar, and, under
pretext of a short shooting excursion, hired a long canoe with four
men, loaded it with the luggage required for a fortnight, and started
with the tide at eleven a.m. on the 6th of January, 1857.</p>

<p>"First we grounded; then we were taken aback; then a puff of
wind drove us forward with railway speed; then we grounded again.</p>

<p>"And now, while writing amid the soughing blasts, the rain, and
the darkened air of a south-western monsoon, I remember with
yearning the bright and beautiful spectacle of those African rivers,
whose loveliness, like that of the dead, seems enhanced by proximity
to decay. We had changed the agreeable and graceful sandstone
scenery, on the sea-board, for a view novel and most characteristic.
The hippopotamus now raised his head from the waters, snorted,
gazed upon us, and sank into his native depths. Alligators, terrified
by the splash of oars, waddled down with their horrid claws, dinting
the slimy bank, and lay like yellow logs, measuring us with small,
malignant, green eyes, deep set under warty brows. Monkeys
rustled the tali trees. Below, jungle&mdash;men and woman&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'So withered, so wild in their attire,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' earth,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And yet are on't.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>And all around reigned the eternal African silence, deep and
saddening, broken only by the curlew's scream, or by the breeze
rustling the tree-tops, whispering among the matted foliage, and
swooning upon the tepid bosom of the wave.</p>

<p>"We sat under a tree till midnight, unsatiated with the charm of
the hour. The moon rained molten silver over the dark foliage of
the wild palms, the stars were as golden lamps suspended in the
limpid air, and Venus glittered diamond-like upon the front of the
firmament. The fireflies now sparkled simultaneously over the
earth; then, as if by concerted impulse, their glow vanished in the
glooms of the ground. At our feet lay the black creek; in the jungle
beasts roared fitfully; and the night wind mingled melancholy sounds
with the swelling murmuring of the stream.</p>

<p>"The tide flowing about midnight, we resumed our way. The
river then became a sable streak between lofty rows of trees. The
hippopotamus snorted close to our stern, and the crew begged me to
fire, for the purpose of frightening 'Sultan Momba'&mdash;a pernicious
rogue. At times we heard the splashing of the beasts as they
scrambled over the shoals; at others, they struggled with loud grunts
up the miry banks. Then again all was quiet. After a protracted
interval of silence, the near voice of a man startled us in the deep
drear stillness of the night, as though it had been some ghostly
sound. At two a.m., reaching a clear tract on the river side&mdash;the
Ghaut or landing-place of Chogway&mdash;we made fast the canoe, looked
to our weapons, and, covering our faces against the heavy, clammy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
dew, lay down to snatch an hour's sleep. The total distance rowed
was about 13.5 miles.</p>

<p>"Fifty stout fellows, with an ambitious leader and a little money,
might soon conquer the whole country, and establish there an
absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>"These Beloch mercenaries merit some notice. They were
preferred, as being somewhat disciplinable, by the late Sayyid Said,
to his futile blacks and his unruly and self-willed Oman Arabs. He
entertained from one thousand to fifteen hundred men, and scattered
them over the country in charge of the forts. The others hate them&mdash;divisions
even amongst his own children was the ruler's policy&mdash;and
nickname them 'Kurara Kurara.' The <i>Jemadar</i> and the
Governor are rarely on speaking terms. Calling themselves Belochies,
they are mostly from the regions about Kech and Bampur. They
are mixed up with a rabble rout of Afghans and Arabs, Indians and
Sudies, and they speak half a dozen different languages. Many of
these gentry have left their country for their country's good. A body
of convicts, however, fights well. The Mekrani are first-rate behind
walls; and if paid, drilled, and officered, they would make as
'varmint' light-bobs as Arnauts. They have a knightly fondness
for arms. A 'young barrel and an old blade' are their delight.
All use the matchlock, and many are skilful with sword and shield.</p>

<p>"Having communicated our project to the <i>Jemadar</i> of Chogway,
he promised, for a consideration, all aid; told us that we should
start the next day; and, curious to relate, kept his word.</p>

<p>"A start was effected at five p.m., every slave complaining of
his load, snatching up the lightest, and hurrying on regardless of
what was left behind. This nuisance endured till summarily stopped
by an outward application easily divined. The evening belling of
deer and the clock-clock of partridge struck our ears. In the open
places were the lesses of elephants, and footprints retained by the
last year's mud. These animals descend to the plains during the
monsoon, and in summer retire to the cool hills. The Belochies
shoot, the wild people kill them with poisoned arrows. More than
once during our wanderings we found the grave-like trap-pits, called
in India, <i>ogi</i>.</p>

<p>"Tusks weighing 100 lbs. each are common, those of 175 lbs. are
not rare, and I have heard of a pair whose joint weight was 560 lbs.</p>

<p>"At Makam Sayyid Sulayman&mdash;a half-cleared ring in the thorny
jungle&mdash;we passed the night in a small babel of Belochies. One
recited his Korán; another prayed; a third told funny stories;
whilst a fourth trolled lays of love and war, long ago made familiar
to my ear upon the rugged Asian hills. This was varied by slapping
lank mosquitoes that flocked to the camp-fires; by rising to get rid
of huge black pismires, whose bite burned like a red-hot needle;
and by challenging two parties of savages, who, armed with bows
and arrows, passed amongst us.</p>

<p>"Tongway is the first offset of the mountain-terrace composing
the land of Usumbara. It rises abruptly from the plain, lies north-west
of, and nine miles, as the crow flies, distant from, Chogway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
The summit, about two thousand feet above the sea-level, is clothed
with jungle, through which, seeking compass-sights, we cut a way with
our swords.</p>

<p>"The climate appeared delicious&mdash;even in the full blaze of an
African and tropical summer; and whilst the hill was green, the
land around was baked like bread-crust.</p>

<p>"The escort felt happy at Tongway, twice a day devouring our
rice&mdash;an unknown luxury; and they were at infinite pains to defer
the evil hour.</p>

<p>"Petty pilferers to the backbone, they steal, like magpies, by
instinct. On the march they lag behind, and, not being professional
porters, they are restive as camels when receiving their load. One
of these youths, happening to be brother-in-law&mdash;after a fashion&mdash;to
the <i>Jemadar</i>, requires incessant supervision to prevent him burdening
the others with his own share. The guide, Muigni Wazira, is a huge,
broad-shouldered Sawahili, with a coal-black skin; his high, massive,
and regular features look as if carved in ebony, and he frowns like a
demon in the 'Arabian Nights.'</p>

<p>"A prayerless Sheríf, he thoroughly despises the Makapry or
Infidels; he has a hot temper, and, when provoked, roars like a wild
beast. He began by refusing his load, but yielded, when it was
gently placed upon his heavy shoulder, with a significant gesture in
case of recusance.</p>

<p>"Rahewat, the Mekrani, calls himself a Beloch, and wears the
title of Shah-Sawar, or the Rider-king. He is the <i>chelebi</i>, the
dandy and tiger of our party. A 'good-looking brown man,' about
twenty-five years old, with a certain girlishness and affectation of
<i>tournure</i> and manner, which bode no good, the Rider-king deals in
the externals of respectability; he washes and prays with pompous
regularity, combs his long hair and beard, trains his bushy moustache
to touch his eyes, and binds a huge turban. Having somewhat high
ideas of discipline, he began with stabbing a slave-boy by way of a
lesson.</p>

<p>"The Rider-king, pleading soldier, positively refuses to carry,
anything but his matchlock, and a private stock of dates, which he
keeps ungenerously to himself. He boasts of prowess in vert and
venison: we never saw him hit the mark, but we missed some
powder and ball.</p>

<p>"The gem of the party is Sudy Mubárak, who has taken to
himself the cognomen of 'Bombay.' His sooty skin, and teeth
pointed like those of the reptilia, denote his Mhiav origin. He is
one of those rare 'Sudies' that delight the passengers in an Indian
steamer. Bombay, sold in early youth, carried to Cutch by some
Banyan, and there emancipated, looks fondly back upon the home
of his adoption, and sighs for the day when a few dollars will enable,
him to return. He has ineffable contempt for all 'jungly niggers.'
His head is a triumph of phrenology. He works on principle, and
works like a horse, openly declaring that not love of us, but
attachment to his stomach, make him industrious. He had
enlisted under the <i>Jemadar</i> of Chogway. We thought, however, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
highly of his qualifications, that persuasion and paying his debts
induced him, after a little coquetting, to take leave of soldiering and
follow our fortunes. Sudy Bombay will be our head gun-carrier, if
he survives his present fever, and, I doubt not, will prove himself a
rascal in the end.</p>

<p>"During the first night all Bombay's efforts were required to
prevent a <i>sauve qui peut</i>.</p>

<p>"On the 10th of February, after a night of desert silence, we arose
betimes, and applied ourselves to the work of porterage. Our
luggage again suffered reduction. It was, however, past six a.m.
when, forming Indian file, we began to descend the thorn-clad goat-track
which spans the north-east spur of Mount Tongway. Overhead
floated a filmy canopy of sea-green verdure, pierced by myriads
of sunbeams, whilst the azure effulgence above, purified as with fire,
from mist and vapour set the picture in a frame of gold and ultramarine.
Painful splendours! The men began to drop off. None
but Hamdan had brought a calabash. Shaaban clamoured for water.
Wazira and the four slave-boys retired to some puddle, a discovery
which they wisely kept to themselves, leaving the rest of the party
to throw themselves under a tree and bush upon the hot ground.</p>

<p>"As the sun sank westward, Wazira joined us with a mouthful of
lies, and the straggling line advanced. Our purblind guide once
more lagged in the rear, yielding the lead to old Shaaban. This
worthy, whose five wits were absorbed in visions of drink, strode
blunderingly ahead, over the Wazira Hills and far away. Jack,
keeping him in sight, and I in rear of both, missed the road.
Shortly after sunset we three reached a narrow <i>fiumara</i>, where stood,
delightful sight! some puddles bright with chickweed, and black
with the mire below. We quenched our thirst, and bathed our
swollen feet, and patted, and felt, and handled the water as though
we loved it. But even this charming occupation had an end.
Evidently we had lost our way. Our shots and shouts remained
unanswered. It would have been folly to thread the thorny jungle
by the dubious light of a young moon. We therefore kindled a fire,
looked at our arms, lay down upon a soft sandy place, and certain
that Shaaban would be watchful as a vestal virgin, were soon lulled
to sleep by the music of the night breeze, and by the frogs chanting
their ancient querele upon the miry margins of the pools. That
day's work had been little more than five leagues. But&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'These high wild hills and rough uneven ways<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Draw out the miles.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>"Our guide secured, as extra porters, five wild men, habited in
primitive attire. Their only garment was a kilt of dried and split
rushes or grass. All had bows and poisoned arrows, except one, who
boasted a miserable musket and literally a powder-horn, the vast
spoils of a cow. The wretches were lean as wintry wolves, and not
less ravenous. We fed them with rice and ghee. Of course they
asked for more, till their stomachs, before like shrunken bladders,
stood out in the shape of little round bumps from the hoop-work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
ribs. We had neglected to take their arms. After feeding, they
arose, and with small beady eyes, twinkling with glee, bade us
farewell. Though starving they would not work. A few hours
afterwards, however, they found a hippopotamus in the open, killed
it with their arrows, and soon left nothing but a heap of bones and a
broad stain of blood upon the ground.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Arrived at Kohoday, the elders, as we landed, wrung our hands
with rollicking greetings, and those immoderate explosive laughings
which render the African family to all appearance so 'jolly' a race.</p>

<p>"We were shown, on the mountain-pass of Usumbara, the watch-fire
which is never extinguished; and the Mzegura chief, when
supplying us with a bullock, poked his thumb back towards the
hills and said, with a roar of laughter, that already we had become
the King's guests. Our Beloch guard applauded this kindred soul,
patted him upon the shoulder, and declared that, with a score
of men of war like themselves, he might soon become lord of
all the mountains.</p>

<p>"Our parting was pathetic. He swore he loved us, and promised,
on our return, the boat to conduct us down the river; but when we
appeared with empty hands, he told the truth, namely, that it is a
succession of falls and rapids.</p>

<p>"At five p.m., passing two bridges, we entered Msiky Mguru, a
Wazegura village distant twelve miles from Kohoday. It is a cluster
of hay-cock huts, touching one another, built upon an island formed
by divers rapid and roaring branches of the river. The headman
was sick, but we found a hospitable reception. We spent our nights
with ants and other little murderers of sleep which shall be nameless.
Our hosts expressed great alarm about the Masai. It was justified
by the sequel. Scarcely had we left the country when a plundering
party of wild spearmen attacked two neighbouring villages, slaughtering
the hapless cultivators, and, with pillage and pollage, drove off
the cows in triumph.</p>

<p>"After an hour's march we skirted a village, where the people
peremptorily ordered us to halt. We attributed this annoyance to
Wazira, who was forthwith visited with a general wigging. But the
impending rain sharpened our tempers; we laughed in the faces
of our angry expostulators, and, bidding them stop us if they could,
pursued our road.</p>

<p>"Presently ascending a hill, and turning abruptly to the north-east,
we found ourselves opposite, and about ten miles distant from, a tall
azure curtain, the mountains of Fuga. Water stood in black pools,
and around it waved luxuriant sugar-canes. In a few minutes
every mouth in the party was tearing and chewing at a long pole.
This cane is of the edible kind. The officinal varieties are too
luscious, cloying, and bilious to be sucked with impunity by civilized
men. After walking that day sixteen miles, at about four p.m. a violent
storm of thunder, lightning, and raw south-west wind, which caused
the thermometer to fall many degrees, and the slaves to shudder and
whimper, drove us back into the <i>bandany</i>, or palaver-house of a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
village. The place swarmed with flies and mosquitoes. We lighted
fires to keep off fevers.</p>

<p>"Sunday, the 15th of February, dawned with one of those steady
little cataclysms, which, to be seen advantageously, must be seen
near the Line. At eleven a.m., weary of the steaming <i>bandany</i>, our
men loaded, and in a lucid interval set out towards the Fuga Hills,<a name="FNanchor_3_94" id="FNanchor_3_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_94" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
to which we walked for economy sake. As we approached them,
the rain shrank to a spitting, gradually ceased, and was replaced by
that reeking, fetid, sepulchral heat which travellers in the tropics
know and fear. The slippery way had wearied our slaves, though
aided by three porters hired that morning; and the sun, struggling
through vapour, was still hot enough to overpower the whole party.</p>

<p>"Issuing from the dripping canopy, we followed a steep goat-track,
fording a crystal burn, and having reached the midway, sat
down to enjoy the rarefied air, and to use the compass and spyglass.
The view before us was extensive, if not beautiful. Under our feet
the mountains fell in rugged folds, clothed with plantain fields, wild
mulberries, custard-apples, and stately trees, whose lustrous green
glittered against the ochreous ground. The sarsaparilla vine hung
in clusters from the supporting limbs of the tamarind, the toddy
palm raised its fantastic arms over the dwarf coco, and bitter oranges
mingled pleasant scent with herbs not unlike mint and sage. Below,
half veiled by rank streams, lay the yellow Nika or Wazegura
wilderness, traversed by a serpentine of trees denoting the course of
the Mkomafi affluent. Far beyond we could see the well-wooded
line of the Lufu river, and from it to the walls of the southern and
western horizon stretched a uniform purple plain.</p>

<p>"The three fresh porters positively refused to rise unless a certain
number of cloths were sent forward to propitiate the magnates of
Fuga. This was easily traced to Wazira, who received a hint that
such trifling might be dangerous. He had been lecturing us all that
morning upon the serious nature of our undertaking. Sultan Kimwere
was a potent monarch, not a Momba. His Ministers and councillors
would, unless well paid, avert from us their countenances. We must
enter with a discharge of musketry to awe the people, and by all
means do as we are bid. The Belochies smiled contempt, and,
pulling up the porters, loaded them, deaf to remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Resuming our march after a short halt, we climbed rather than
walked, with hearts beating from such unusual exercise, up the deep
zigzag of a torrent. Villages then began to appear perched like
eyries upon the hilltops, and the people gathered to watch our
approach. At four p.m. we found ourselves upon the summit of a
ridge. The Belochies begged us to taste the water of a spring hard
by. It was icy cold, with a perceptible chalybeate flavour, sparkled
in the cup, and had dyed its head with rust.</p>

<p>"The giant flanks of Mukumbara bound the view. We stood
about four thousand feet above the sea-level, distant thirty-seven
miles from the coast, and seventy-four or seventy-five along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
winding river. There is a short cut from Kohoday across the
mountains; but the route was then waterless, and the heat would
have disabled our Belochies.</p>

<p>"After another three-mile walk along the hill flanks, we turned a
corner and suddenly sighted, upon the opposite summit of a grassy
cone, an unfenced heap of hay-cock huts&mdash;Fuga. This being one of
the Cities where ingress is now forbidden to strangers, we were led
by Wazira through timid crowds that shrank back as we approached,
round and below the cone, to four tattered huts, which superstition
assigns as the 'travellers' bungalow.' Even the son and heir of
great Kimwere must abide here till the lucky hour admits him to
the presence and the Imperial City. The cold rain and sharp rarefied
air rendering any shelter acceptable, we cleared the huts of sheep
and goats, housed our valuables, and sent Sudy Bombay to the
Sultan, requesting the honour of an interview.</p>

<p>"Before dark appeared three bareheaded <i>mdue</i>, or 'Ministers,'
who in long palaver declared that council must squat upon two
knotty points&mdash;<i>Primo</i>, Why and wherefore we had entered the
country <i>viâ</i> the hostile Wazegura? <i>Secundo</i>, What time might be
appointed by his Majesty's <i>mganga</i>, or medicine-man, for the
ceremony? Sharp-witted Hamdan at once declared us to be
European wizards, and <i>waganga</i> of peculiar power over the moon
and stars, the wind and rain. Away ran the Ministers to report the
wonder.</p>

<p>"The <i>mganga</i>, who is called by the Arabs <i>tabib</i>, or doctor, and
by us priest, physician, divine, magician, and medicine-man, combines,
as these translations show, priestly with medical functions.</p>

<p>"At six p.m. the Ministers ran back and summoned us to the
'Palace.' They led the way through rain and mist to a clump of
the usual huts, half hidden by trees, and overspreading a little
eminence opposite to and below Fuga.</p>

<p>"Sultan Kimwere half rose from his cot as we entered, and
motioned us to sit upon dwarf stools before him. He was an old,
old man, emaciated by sickness. His head was shaved, his face
beardless, and wrinkled like a grandam's; his eyes were red, his
jaws disfurnished, and his hands and feet were stained with leprous
spots. Our errand was inquired and we were welcomed to Fuga.
As none could read the Sayyid of Zanzibar's letter, I was obliged to
act secretary. The centagenarian had heard of our scrutinizing
stars, stones, and trees. He directed us at once to compound a
draught which would restore him to health, strength, and youth. I
replied that our drugs had been left at Pangany. He signified that
we might wander about the hills and seek the plants required.
After half an hour's conversation, Hamdan being interpreter, we
were dismissed with a renewal of welcome.</p>

<p>"On our return to the hovels, the present was forwarded to the
Sultan with the usual ceremony. We found awaiting us a fine
bullock, a basketful of <i>sima</i>&mdash;young Indian corn pounded and
boiled to a thick hard paste&mdash;and balls of unripe bananas, peeled
and mashed up with sour milk. Our Belochies instantly addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
themselves to the making of beef, which they ate with such a will
that unpleasant symptoms presently declared themselves in camp.
We had covered that day ten miles&mdash;equal, perhaps, to thirty in a
temperate climate and a decent road. The angry blast, the groaning
trees, and the lashing rain, heard from within a warm hut, affected
us pleasurably, and I would not have exchanged it for the music of
Verdi. We slept the sweet sleep of travellers.</p>

<p>"The African Traveller, in this section of the nineteenth century,
is an animal overworked. Formerly, the reading public was satisfied
with dry details of mere discovery; was delighted with a few latitudes
and longitudes. Of late, in this, as in other pursuits, the
standard has been raised. Whilst marching so many miles <i>per diem</i>,
and watching a certain number of hours <i>per noctem</i>, the traveller,
who is in fact his own general, adjutant, quarter-master, and executive,
is expected to survey and observe&mdash;to record meteorology,
hygrometry, and hypsometry&mdash;to shoot and stuff birds and beasts,
to collect geological specimens, to gather political and commercial
information, to advance the infant study ethnology, to keep accounts,
to sketch, to indite a copious legible journal, to collect grammar
and vocabularies, and frequently to forward long reports which shall
prevent the Royal Geographical Society napping through evening
meetings. It is right, I own, to establish a high standard which
insures some work being done; but explorations should be distinguished
from railway journeys, and a broad line drawn between
the feasible and the impossible. The unconscionable physicist now
deems it his right to complain, because the explorer has not used
his theodolite in the temple of Mecca, and introduced his sympiesometer
within the walls of Harar. An ardent gentlemen once requested
me to collect beetles, and another sent me excellent recipes
for preserving ticks.</p>

<p>"These African explorations are small campaigns, in which the
traveller, unaided by discipline, is beset by all the troubles, hardships,
and perils of savage war. He must devote himself to feeding,
drilling, and directing his men to the use of arms and the conduct
of a Caravan, rather than the study of infusoria and barometers.
The sight of an instrument convinces barbarians that the stranger is
bringing down the sun, stopping rain, causing death, and bewitching
the land for ages. Amidst utter savagery such operations are sometimes
possible; amongst the semi-civilized they end badly. The
climate also robs man of energy as well as health. He cannot, if he
would, collect ticks and beetles. The simplest geodesical labours,
as these pages will prove, are unadvisable. Jack has twice suffered
from taking an altitude. Why is not a party of physicists sent out
to swallow the dose prescribed by them to their army of martyrs?</p>

<p>"The rainy monsoon had set in at Fuga. Heavy clouds rolled up
from the south-west, and during our two days and nights upon the
hills the weather was a succession of drip, drizzle, and drench. In
vain we looked for a star; even the sun could not disperse the thick
raw vapours that rose from the steamy earth. We did not dare to
linger upon the mountains. Our Belochies were not clad to resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the temperature&mdash;here 12° lower than on the coast; the rain would
make the lowlands a hotbed of sickness, and we daily expected the
inevitable 'seasoning-fever.' In the dry monsoon this route might
be made practicable to Chhaga and Kilimanjaro. With an escort of
a hundred musketeers, and at an expense of £600, the invalid who
desires to avail himself of this 'sanitarium,' as it is now called by
the Indian papers, may, if perfectly sound in wind, limb, and digestion,
reach the snowy region, if it exist, after ten mountain-marches,
which will not occupy more than a month.</p>

<p>"The head-quarter village of Usumbara is Fuga, a heap of some
five hundred huts, containing, I was told, three thousand souls. It
is defenceless, and composed of the circular abodes common from
Harar to Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>"On Monday, the 16th of February, we took leave of, and were
duly dismissed by, Sultan Kimwere. The old man, however, was
mortified that our rambles had not produced a plant of sovereign
virtue against the last evil of life. He had long expected a white
<i>mganga</i>, and now two had visited him, to depart without even a
trial! I felt sad to see the wistful lingering look with which he
accompanied 'Kuahery!' (farewell!) But his case was far beyond
my skill.</p>

<p>"None of Sultan Kimwere's men dared to face the terrible
Wazegura.</p>

<p>"We descended the hills in a Scotch mist and drizzle, veiling
every object from view. It deepened into a large-dropped shower
upon the fœtid lowlands. That night we slept at Pasunga; the next
at Msiky Mguru; and the third, after marching seventeen miles&mdash;our
greatest distance&mdash;at Kohoday.</p>

<p>"Our Belochies declared the rate of marching excessive; and
Hamdan, who personified 'Master Shoetie, the great traveller,'
averred that he had twice visited the Lakes, but had never seen such
hardships in his dreams.</p>

<p>"With some toil, however, we coaxed him into courage, and joined
on the way a small party bound for Pangany. At one p.m. we
halted to bathe and drink, as it would be some time before we
should again sight the winding stream. During the storm of thunder
and lightning which ensued, I observed that our savage companions,
like the Thracians of old Herodotus, and the Bheels and coolies of
modern India, shot their iron-tipped arrows in the air.</p>

<p>"About four p.m. we found ourselves opposite Kizanga, a large
Wazegura village on the right bank of the river. From Kizanga
we followed the river by a vile footpath. The air was dank and
oppressive; the clouds seemed to settle upon the earth, and the
decayed vegetation exhaled a feverish fœtor. As we advanced, the
roar of the swollen stream told of rapids, whilst an occasional
glimpse through its green veil showed a reefous surface, flecked
with white froth. Heavy nimbi purpled the western skies, and we
began to inquire of Wazira whether a village was at hand.</p>

<p>"About sunset, after marching fifteen miles, we suddenly saw tall
cocos&mdash;in these lands the 'traveller's joy'&mdash;waving their feathery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
heads against the blue eastern firmament. Presently, crossing a
branch of the river by a long bridge, we entered an island settlement
of Wazegura. This village, being upon the confines of civilization,
and excited by wars and rumours of wars, suggested treachery to
experienced travellers. Jack and I fired our revolvers into trees,
and carefully reloaded them for the public benefit. The sensation
was such that we seized the opportunity of offering money for rice
and ghee. No provision, however, was procurable. Our escort
went to bed supperless; Hamdan cursing this <i>Safar kháis&mdash;Anglicè</i>,
rotten journey. Murad Ali had remained at Msiky Mguru
to purchase a slave without our knowledge. A novice in such
matters, he neglected to tie the man's thumb, and had the exquisite
misery to see, in the evening after the sale, his dollars bolting at
a pace that baffled pursuit. We then placed our weapons handy,
and were soon lulled to sleep, despite smoke, wet beds, and other
plagues, by the blustering wind and the continuous pattering of
rain.</p>

<p>"At sunrise on Friday, the 20th of February, we were aroused by
the guide; and, after various delays, found ourselves on the road
about seven a.m. This day was the reflection of the last march.
At nine a.m. we stood upon a distant eminence to admire the falls
of the Pangany river. Here the stream, emerging from a dense
dark growth of tropical forest, hurls itself in three huge sheets,
fringed with flashing foam, down a rugged wall of brown rock.
Halfway the fall is broken by a ledge, whence a second leap precipitates
the waters into the mist-veiled basin of stone below.
These cascades must be grand during the monsoon, when the river,
forming a single horseshoe, acquires a volume and a momentum
sufficient to clear the step which divides the shrunken stream. Of
all natural objects, the cataract most requires that first element of
sublimity&mdash;size. Yet, as it was, this fall, with the white spray and
bright mist, set off by black jungle, and a framework of slaty rain-cloud,
formed a picture sufficiently effective to surprise us.</p>

<p>"As we journeyed onwards the heat became intense. The nimbi
hugged the mountain tops. There it was winter; but the sun, whose
beams shot stingingly through translucent air, parched the summer
plains. At ten a.m. our Belochies, clean worn out by famine and
fatigue, threw themselves upon the bank of a broad and deep ravine,
in whose sedgy bed a little water still lingered. Half an hour's rest,
a cocoa-nut each, a pipe, and, above all things, the <i>spes finis</i>, restored
their vigour. We resumed our march over a rolling waste of green,
enlivened by occasional glimpses of the river, whose very aspect
cooled the gazer. Villages became frequent as we advanced, far
distancing our Belochies. At three p.m., after marching fourteen
miles, we sighted the snake-fence and the pent-houses of friendly
Chogway.</p>

<p>"The <i>Jemadar</i> and his garrison received us with all the honours
of travel, and admired our speedy return from Fuga. As at Harar,
a visitor can never calculate upon a prompt dismissal. We were
too strong for force, but Sultan Kimwere has detained Arab and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
other strangers for a fortnight before his <i>mganga</i> fixed a fit time
for audience. Moreover, these walking journeys are dangerous in
one point: the least accident disables a party, and accidents will
happen to the best-regulated expedition.</p>

<p>"Our feet were cut by boots and shoes, and we had lost 'leather'
by chafing and sunburns. A few days' rest removed these inconveniences.
Our first visit was paid to Pangany, where Said bin
Salim, who had watched his charge with the fidelity of a shepherd's
dog, received us with joyous demonstrations. After spending a day
upon the coast, we returned, provided with <i>munitions de bouche</i> and
other necessaries, to Chogway, and settled old scores with our
escort. Then, as the vessel in which we were to cruise southward
was not expected from Zanzibar till the 1st of March, and we had
a week to spare, it was resolved to try a fall with Behemoth.<a name="FNanchor_4_95" id="FNanchor_4_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_95" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Hippopotamus_Shooting"></a>Hippopotamus Shooting.</i></div>

<p>"Captain Owen's officers, when ascending streams, saw their
boats torn by Behemoth's hard tusks; and in the Pangany, one
'Sultan Momba,' a tyrant thus dubbed by the Belochies in honour
of their friend the Kohoday chief, delighted to upset canoes, and
was once guilty of breaking a man's leg.</p>

<p>"Behold us now, O brother in St. Hubert, dropping down the
stream in a <i>monoxyle</i>, some forty feet long, at early dawn, when
wild beasts are tamest.</p>

<p>"As we approach the herds, whose crests, flanked with small
pointed ears, dot the mirrory surface, our boatmen indulge in such
vituperations as 'Mana marira!' (O big belly!) and 'Hanamkia!'
(O tasteless one!) In angry curiosity the brutes raise their heads,
and expose their arched necks, shiny with trickling rills. Jack, a
man of speculative turn, experiments upon the nearest optics with
two barrels of grape and B shot. The eyes, however, are oblique;
the charge scatters, and the brute, unhurt, slips down like a seal.
This will make the herd wary. Vexed by the poor result of our
trial, we pole up the rippling and swirling surface, that proves the
enemy to be swimming under water towards the further end of the
pool. After a weary time he must rise and breathe. As the smooth
water undulates, swells, and breaches a way for the large black head,
eight ounces of lead fly in the right direction. There is a splash,
a struggle; the surface foams, and Behemoth, with mouth bleeding
like a gutter-spout, rears, and plunges above the stream. Wounded
near the cerebellum, he cannot swim straight. At last a <i>coup de
grâce</i> speeds through the air; the brute sinks, gore dyes the surface
purple, and bright bubbles seethe up from the bottom. Hippo is
dead. We wait patiently for his reappearance, but he appears not.
At length, by peculiar good luck, Bombay's sharp eye detects an
object some hundred yards down stream. We make for it, and find
our "bag" brought up in a shallow by a spit of sand, and already in
process of being ogled by a large fish-hawk. The hawk suffers the
penalty of impudence. We tow our defunct to the bank, and deliver
it to certain savages, whose mouths water with the prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
hippopotamus beef. At sundown they will bring to us the tusks
and head picked clean, as a whistle is said to be.</p>

<p>"The herd will no longer rise; they fear this hulking craft; we
must try some 'artful dodge.' Jack, accompanied by Bombay, who
strips to paddle in token of hot work expected, enters into a small
canoe, ties fast his shooting-tackle in case of an upset, and, whilst I
occupy one end of the house, makes for the other. Whenever a
head appears an inch above water, a heavy bullet 'puds' into or
near it; crimson patches adorn the stream; some die and disappear,
others plunge in crippled state, and others, disabled from diving by
holes drilled through their noses, splash and scurry about with
curious snorts, caused by breath passing through their wounds. At
last Jack ventures upon another experiment. An infant hippo,
with an imprudence pardonable at his years, uprears his crest; off
flies the crown of the kid's head. The bereaved mother rises for a
moment, viciously regards Jack, who is meekly loading, snorts a
parent's curse, and dives as the cap is being adjusted. Presently a
bump, a shock, and a heave send the little canoe's bows high in
the air. Bombay, describing a small parabola in frog-shape, lands
beyond the enraged brute's back. Jack steadies himself in the
stern, and as the assailant, with broad dorsum hunched up and
hogged like an angry cat, advances for another bout, he rises, and
sends a bullet through her side. Bombay scrambles in, and, nothing
daunted, paddles towards the quarry, of which nothing is visible but
a long waving line of gore. With a harpoon we might have secured
her; now she will feed the alligators or the savages.</p>

<p>"The Belochies still take great interest in the sport, as Easterns
will when they see work being done. They force the boatmen to
obey us. Jack lands with the black woodmen, carrying both
'smashers.' He gropes painfully through mangrove thicket, where
parasitical oysters wound the legs with their sharp edges, and the
shaking bog admits a man to his knees. After a time, reaching a
clear spot, he takes up position behind a bush impending the
deepest water, and signals me to drive up the herd. In pursuit of
them I see a hole bursting in the stream, and a huge black head
rises with a snort and a spirt. 'Momba! Momba!' shout the
Belochies, yet the old rogue disdains flight. A cone from the Colt
strikes him full in front of the ear; his brain is pierced; he rises
high, falls with a crash upon the wave, and all that flesh 'cannot
keep in a little life.' Momba has for ever disappeared from the
home of hippopotamus; never shall he break nigger's leg again.
Meanwhile the herd, who, rubbing their backs against the great
canoe, had retired to the other end of the pool, hearing an unusual
noise, rise, as is their wont, to gratify a silly curiosity. Jack has
two splendid standing shots, and the splashing and circling in the
stream below tell the accuracy of the aim.</p>

<p>"We soon learned the lesson that these cold-blooded animals
may be killed with a pistol-ball if hit in brain or heart; otherwise
they carry away as much lead as elephants. At about ten a.m. we
had slain six, besides wounding I know not how many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
animals. They might be netted, but the operation would not pay
in a pecuniary sense; the ivory of small teeth, under four pounds
each, is worth little. Being perpetually pop-gunned by the Belochies,
they are exceedingly shy, and after an excess of bullying they
shift quarters. We returned but once to this sport, finding the
massacre monotonous, and such cynegetics about as exciting as
partridge-shooting.</p>

<p>"On Thursday, the 26th of February, we left 'the bazar.' Jack
walked to Pangany, making a route survey, whilst I accompanied
the <i>Jemadar</i> and his tail in our large canoe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_First_Fever"></a>Our First Fever.</i></div>

<p>"For two days after returning to the coast we abstained from
exercise. On the third we walked out several miles, in the hottest
of suns, to explore a cavern, of which the natives, who came upon it
when clearing out a well, had circulated the most exaggerated
accounts. Jack already complained of his last night's labour&mdash;an
hour with the sextant upon damp sand in the chilly dew. This walk
finished the work. On entering the house we found the Portuguese
lad, who had accompanied us to Fuga, in a high fever. Jack was
prostrated a few hours afterwards, and next day I followed their
example.</p>

<p>"As a rule, the traveller in these lands should avoid exposure
and fatigue beyond a certain point, to the very best of his ability.
You might as well practise sitting upon a coal-fire as inuring yourself
(which green men have attempted) to the climate. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;, a
Polish divine, who had taken to travelling at the end of a sedentary
life, would learn to walk bareheaded in the Zanzibar sun; the result
was a sunstroke. Others have paced barefooted upon an exposed
terrace, with little consequence but ulceration and temporary lameness.
The most successful in resisting the climate are they who
tempt it least, and the best training for a long hungry march is
repose, with good living. Man has then stamina to work upon; he
may exist, like the camel, upon his own fat. Those who fine themselves
down by exercise and abstinence before the march, commit
the error of beginning where they ought to end.</p>

<p>"Our attacks commenced with general languor and heaviness, a
lassitude in the limbs, a weight in the head, nausea, a frigid sensation
creeping up the extremities, and dull pains in the shoulders.
Then came a mild, cold fit, succeeded by a splitting headache,
flushed face, full veins, vomiting, and an inability to stand upright.
Like 'General Tazo' of Madagascar, this fever is a malignant
bilious-remittent. The eyes become hot, heavy, and painful when
turned upwards; the skin is dry and burning, the pulse full and
frequent, and the tongue furred; appetite is wholly wanting (for a
whole week I ate nothing), but a perpetual craving thirst afflicts the
patient, and nothing that he drinks will remain upon his stomach.
During the day extreme weakness causes anxiety and depression;
the nights are worse, for by want of sleep the restlessness is aggravated.
Delirium is common in the nervous and bilious temperament,
and if the lancet be used, certain death ensues; the action of
the heart cannot be restored. The exacerbations are slightly but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
distinctly marked (in my own case they recurred regularly between
two and three a.m. and p.m.), and the intervals are closely watched
for administering quinine, after due preparation. This drug, however,
has killed many, especially Frenchmen, who, by overdosing
at a wrong time, died of apoplexy.</p>

<p>"Whilst the Persians were at Zanzibar they besieged Colonel
Hamerton's door, begging him to administer Warburg's drops, which
are said to have a wonderful effect in malignant chronic cases.
When the disease intends to end fatally, the symptoms are aggravated;
the mind wanders, the body loses all power, and after perhaps
an apparent improvement, stupor, insensibility, and death ensue.
On the other hand, if yielding to treatment, the fever, about the
seventh day, presents marked signs of abatement; the tongue is
clearer, pain leaves the head and eyes, the face is no longer flushed,
nausea ceases, and a faint appetite returns. The recovery, however,
is always slow and dubious. Relapses are feared, especially at the
full and change of the moon; they frequently assume the milder intermittent
type, and in some Indians have recurred regularly through
the year. In no case, however, does the apparent severity of the
fever justify the dejection and debility of the convalescence. For
six weeks recovery is imperfect; the liver acts with unusual energy,
the stomach is liable to severe indigestion, the body is lean, and
the strength wellnigh prostrated. At such times change of air is the
best of restoratives; removal, even to a ship in the harbour, or to
the neighbouring house, has been found more beneficial than all
the tonics and the preventatives in the Pharmacopœia.</p>

<p>"In men of strong nervous diathesis the fever leaves slight consequences,
in the shape of white hair, boils, or bad toothaches.
Others suffer severely from its secondaries, which are either visceral
or cerebral. Some lose memory, others virility, others the use of
a limb; many become deaf or dim-sighted; and not a few, tormented
by hepatitis, dysentery, constipation, and similar disease, never
completely recover health.</p>

<p>"Captain Owen's survey of the Mombas Mission, and of our
numerous cruisers, proves that no European can undergo exposure
and fatigue, which promote the overflow of bile, without undergoing
the 'seasoning.' It has, however, one advantage&mdash;those who pass
the ordeal are acclimatized; even with a year's absence in Europe,
they return to the tropics with little danger. The traveller is always
advised to undergo his seasoning upon the coast before marching
into the interior; but after recovery he must await a second attack,
otherwise he will expend in preparation the strength and bottom
required for the execution of his journey. Of our party the Portuguese
boy came in for his turn at Zanzibar. The other has ever
since had light relapses; and as a proof that the negro enjoys no
immunity, Seedy<a name="FNanchor_5_96" id="FNanchor_5_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_96" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Bombay is at this moment (June 8th) suffering
severely.</p>

<p>"The Banyans intended great civility; they would sit with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
for hours, asking, like Orientals, the silliest of questions, and thinking
withal that they were 'doing the agreeable:' repose was out of
the question. During the day, flies and gnats added another sting
to the mortifications of fever. At night, rats nibbled at our feet,
mosquitoes sang their song of triumph, and a torturing thirst made
the terrible sleeplessness yet more terrible. Our minds were
morbidly fixed upon one point, the arrival of our vessel; we had
no other occupation but to rise and gaze, and exchange regrets as
a sail hove in sight, drew near, and passed by. We knew that there
would be no failure on the part of our thoughtful friend, who had
written to promise us a <i>battela</i> on the 1st of March, which did not
make Pangany till the evening of the 5th of March.</p>

<p>"After sundry bitter disappointments, we had actually hired
a Banyan's boat that had newly arrived, when the expected craft
ran into the river. Not a moment was to be lost. Said bin Salim,
who had been a kind nurse, superintended the embarkation of our
property. Jack, less severely treated, was able to walk to the shore;
but I&mdash;alas for manliness!&mdash;was obliged to be supported like a
bedridden old woman. The worst part of the process was the
presence of a crowd. The Arabs were civil, and bade a kindly
farewell. The Sawahili, however, audibly contrasted the present
with the past, and drew dedecorous conclusions from the change
which a few days had worked in the man who bore a twenty-four
pound gun, my pet four-ounce.<a name="FNanchor_6_97" id="FNanchor_6_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_97" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"All thoughts of cruising along the southern coast were at an end.
Colonel Hamerton had warned us not to despise bilious-remittents;
and evidently we should not have been justified in neglecting his
caution to return, whenever seized by sickness. With the dawn of
Friday, the 6th of March, we ordered the men to up sail; we stood
over for Zanzibar with a fine fresh breeze, and early in the afternoon
we found ourselves once more within the pale of Eastern civilization.
<i>Deo gratias!</i> our excellent friend at once sent us to bed, whence,
gentle reader, we have the honour to make the reverential salaam."</p></blockquote>

<h4>THE REAL START FOR TANGANYIKA IN THE INTERIOR.</h4>


<blockquote>

<p>"When we left Zanzibar the Sultan of Zanzibar and the Sawahil and
his sons came on board with three letters of introduction. One was
to Musa Mzuri, the Indian <i>doyen</i> of the merchants settled at Unyamwezi;
secondly, a letter to the Arabs there resident, and thirdly, one
to all his subjects who were travelling in the interior. I carried, in
an <i>étui</i> round my neck, the diploma of the Shaykh El Islam of
Mecca, and a passport from Cardinal Wiseman to all the Catholic
missionaries. His Highness the Sultan Said of Muscat had died on
his way from Arabia to Zanzibar. The party, besides Jack and I,
were two Goanese boys, two negro gun-carriers, the Seedy Mubárak
Mombai (Bombay), his brother, and eight Beloch mercenaries
appointed by the Sultan. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, her Majesty's
Consul at Zanzibar, a friend of mine, gave me all particulars and
recommendations, and enlisted in my favour the Sayyid Sulayman
bin Hamid bin Said (the noble Omani, 'who never forgets the
name of his Grandsire'), landed us upon the coast, and superintended
our departure, attended by Mr. Frost, the apothecary
attached to the Consulate.</p>

<p>"My desire was to ascertain the limits of the Sea of Ujiji, Tanganyika,
or Unyamwezi Lake, to learn the ethnography of its tribes, and
determine the export of the produce of the interior. The Foreign
Office granted £1000, and the Court of Directors allowed me
two years' leave of absence to command the Expedition. Consul
Hamerton warned us against Kilwa, where any one attempting to
open the interior ran the danger of being murdered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Long_March"></a>A Long March.</i></div>

<p>"We landed at Wale Point, about eighty-four miles distant from
the little town of Bagamóyo. We wanted to engage one hundred
and seventy porters, but we could only get thirty-six, and thirty
animals were found, which were all dead in six months, so we had
to leave part of our things behind, greater part of the ammunition,
and our iron boat. The Hindoos were faithful to their promise to
forward everything, but, great mistake, received one hundred and fifty
dollars for the hire of twenty-two men to start in ten days; we went
on, obliged to trust, but we did not get them for eleven months.
We paid various visits to the hippopotamus haunts, and had our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
boat uplifted from the water upon the points of two tusks, which
made corresponding holes in the bottom. My escort were under
the impression that nothing less than one hundred guards, one
hundred and fifty guns, and several cannon would enable them to
fight a way through the perils of the interior. We were warned
that for three days we must pass through savages, who sat on the
trees, and discharged poisoned arrows into the air with extraordinary
dexterity (meaning the Amazons); that they must avoid trees (which
was not easy in a land all forest); that the Wazaramo had sent six
several letters forbidding the white man to enter their country, and
that they buried their provisions in the jungle, that travellers might
starve; that one rhinoceros kills two hundred men; that armies of
elephants attack camps by night; that the craven hyæna is more
dangerous than a Bengal tiger.</p>

<p>"We owed all our intrigues to a rascal named Ramji, who had his
own commerce in view, and often to our <i>Ras Kaptan</i>, or Caravan
leader, Said bin Salim, who did not wear well. The varnish soon
melted, and showed him as great a liar and thief as his men. At
times it is good to appear a dupe, to allow people to think and to
say that you are a muff, chronicling a vow that they shall change
places with you before the end of the game. I confided to Mr.
Frost two manuscripts addressed through the Foreign Office, one
to Mr. John Blackwood of Edinburgh, the other to Mr. Norton
Shaw, of the Royal Geographical Society. Blackwood's arrived
safe, Norton Shaw's in six years.<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id="FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I took a melancholy leave
of my warm-hearted friend, Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, who had
death written on his features. He looked forward to death with
a feeling of delight, the result of his Roman Catholic religious
convictions, and, in spite of my entreaties, he <i>would</i> remain near
the coast till he heard of our safe transit through the lands of the
dangerous Wazaramo. This courage was indeed sublime, an example
not often met with. After this affecting farewell we landed
at Kaolé. I insisted that Ladha, the Collector of customs, and
Ramji, his clerk, should insert in the estimate the sum required to
purchase a boat upon the Sea of Ujiji. Being a Hindoo, he thought
I was ignorant of Cutchee, so the following conversation took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Ladha</i>. Will he ever reach it?</p>

<p>"<i>Ramji</i>. Of course not. What is <i>he</i> that he should pass through
Ugogo? (a province about halfway).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I remarked at once that I <i>did</i> intend to cross Ugogo, and also
the Sea of Ujiji, that I did know Cutchee, and that I was even able
to distinguish between the debits and the credits of his voluminous
sheets. The worst loss that I had was that my old and valued
friend, Dr. Steinhaüser, civil surgeon at Aden, sound scholar, good
naturalist, skilful practitioner, with rare personal qualities, which
would have been inestimable, was ill and could not come. His
Highness the late Sayyid Said, that great ally of the English nation,
had made most public-spirited offers to his friend, Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton, for many years. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton's extraordinary
personal qualities enabled him to perform anything but
impossibilities amongst the Arabs, and he was dying. Finally, as
Indian experience taught me, I was entering the 'unknown land' at
the fatal season when the shrinking of the waters after the wet
monsoon would render it a hotbed of malaria, but I was tied by
scanty means and a limited 'leave;' it was neck or nothing, and I
determined to risk it. All the serving men in Zanzibar Island and
the East African coast are serviles. There is no word to express a
higher domestic. There was no remedy, so that I paid them
wages, and treated them as if they were free men. I had no power
to prevent my followers purchasing slaves, because they would say,
'We are allowed by our law to do so;' all I could do was to see
that their slaves were well fed and not injured; but I informed all
the wild people that Englishmen were pledged against slavery, and
I always refused all slaves offered as presents.</p>

<p>"In eighteen days we accomplished (despite sickness and every
manner of difficulty) a march of one hundred and eighteen indirect
statute miles, and entered K'hutu, the safe rendezvous of foreign
merchants, on the 14th of July. On the 15th we entered Kiruru,
where I found a cottage, and enjoyed for the first time an atmosphere
of sweet, warm smoke." (In all Richard's wilder travels in
damp places, he laid such a stress upon "sweet, warm smoke.")
"Jack (that is, Speke), in spite of my endeavours, would remain in
the reeking miry tent, and laid the foundations of the fever which
threatened his life in the mountains of Usagára.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Marsh_Fever"></a>Marsh Fever.</i></div>

<p>"As soon as we reached Dut'húmi, where we were detained nearly
a week, the malaria brought on attacks of marsh fever. In my case
it lasted twenty days." (In all Richard's fever fits, and for hours
afterwards, both now and always, he had a queer conviction of
divided identity, never ceasing to be two persons, who generally
thwarted and opposed each other, and also that he was able to
fly.) "Jack suffered still more; he had a fainting-fit which strongly
resembled a sunstroke, and it seemed to affect him more or less
throughout our journey. Our sufferings were increased by the losses
of our animals, and we had to walk, often for many miles,
through sun, rain, mud, and miasmatic putridities. The asses
shy, stumble, rear, run away, fight, plunge and pirouette when
mounted; they hog and buck till they burst their girths; they love
to get into holes and hollows; they rush about like pigs when the
wind blows; they bolt under tree-shade when the sun shines; so they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
have to be led, and if the least thing happens the slave drops the
halter and runs away.</p>

<p>"The Zanzibar riding-asses were too delicate and died; we were
then reduced to the half-reclaimed beast of Wamyamwezi. As to
the baggage animals, they were constantly thrown, and the Beloch
only grumbled, sat down, and stared. They stole the ropes and
cords; they never were pounded for the night, nobody counted
them, and we were too ill to look after it. We were wretched;
each morning dawned with a fresh load of care and trouble, and
every evening we knew that another miserable morrow was to dawn,
but I never relinquished the determination to risk everything,
myself included, rather than to return unsuccessful. At Dut'húmi,
two Chiefs fought, and the strongest kidnapped five of his weaker
neighbour subjects. I could not stand by and see iniquity done
without an attempt, so I headed a little Expedition against the
strong, and I had the satisfaction of restoring the rescued, the five
unhappy stolen wretches, to their hearths and homes, and two
decrepit old women, that had been rescued from slavery, thanked
me with tears of joy" (Richard lightly calls this "an easy good
deed" done), "after which I was able, though with swimming head
and trembling hands, to prepare a report for the Geographical
Society.</p>

<p>"On the 24th of July we were able to move on under the oppressive
rain-sun. From Central K'hutu to the base of the Usagára Mountains
there were nothing but filthy heaps of the rudest hovels, built in
holes of the jungle. Their miserable inhabitants, whose frames are
lean with constant intoxication, and whose limbs are distorted by
ulcerous sores, attest the hostility of Nature to Mankind.</p>

<p>"Arrived at Zungomero, we waited a fortnight for the twenty-two
promised porters. It was a hotbed of pestilence, where we nearly
found wet graves. Our only lodging was the closed eaves of a hut;
the roof was a sieve, the walls all chinks, and the floor a sheet of
mud. The Beloch had no energy to build a shed, and became almost
mutinous because we did not build it for them.</p>

<p>"Our life here was the acme of discomfort; we had pelting showers,
followed by fiery sunshine, which extracted steam from the grass,
bush, and trees. My Goanese boys got a mild form of 'yellow
Jack,' and I was obliged to take them into my hut, already populated
with pigeons, rats, flies, mosquitoes, bugs, and fleas. We were weary
of waiting for the porters and baggage, so we prepared our papers,
and sent them down by a confidential slave to the coast. Jack and
I left Zungomero on the 7th of August. We were so weak, we could
hardly sit our asses, but we were determined to get to the nearest
ascent of the Usagára Mountains, a march of five hours, and
succeeded in rising three hundred feet from the plain, ascending its
first gradient.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="They_ascend_from_Zungomero_to_a_Better_Climate"></a>They ascend from Zungomero to a Better Climate.</i></div>

<p>"This is the frontier of the second region, or Ghauts. There
was no vestige of buildings, nor sight nor sound of Man. There
was a wondrous change of climate at this place, called Mzizi
Maogo; strength and health returned as if by magic, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Goanese shook off their mild 'yellow Jack.' Truly delicious was
the escape from the nebulous skies, the fog-driving gusts, the pelting
rain, the clammy mists veiling a gross growth of fœtor, the damp raw
cold rising as it were from the earth, and the alternations of fiery
and oppressive heat; in fact, from the cruel climate of the river
valley, to the pure sweet mountain air, alternately soft and balmy,
cool and reviving, and to the aspect of clear blue skies, which lent
their tints to highland ridges well wooded with various greens.</p>

<p>"Dull mangrove, dismal jungle, and monotonous grass were
supplanted by tall solitary trees, amongst which the lofty tamarind
rose conspicuously graceful, and a card-table-like swamp,
cut by a network of streams, nullahs, and stagnant pools, gave way
to dry healthy slopes, with short steep pitches and gently shelving
hills. The beams of the large sun of the Equator&mdash;and nowhere
have I seen the Rulers of Night and Day so large&mdash;danced gaily upon
blocks and pebbles of red, yellow, and dazzling snowy quartz, and
the bright sea-breeze waved the summits of the trees, from which
depended graceful llianas and wood-apples large as melons, whilst
creepers, like vine tendrils, rising from large bulbs of brown-grey
wood, clung closely to their stalwart trunks. Monkeys played at
hide-and-seek, chattering behind the bolls, as the iguana, with its
painted scale-armour, issued forth to bask upon the sunny bank;
white-breasted ravens cawed when disturbed from their perching
places, doves cooed on the well-clothed boughs, and hawks soared
high in the transparent sky. The field-cricket chirped like the
Italian cicala in the shady bush, and everywhere, from air, from
earth, from the hill-slopes above, and from the marshes below,
the hum, the buzz, and the loud continuous voice of insect life,
through the length of the day, spoke out its natural joy. Our gypsy
encampment lay</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'By shallow rivers, to whose falls<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Melodious birds sing madrigals.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>By night, the soothing murmurs of the stream at the hill's base
rose mingled with the faint rustling of the breeze, which at times,
broken by the scream of the night-heron, the bellow of the bull-frog
in his swamp home, the cynhyæna's whimper, and the fox's
whining bark, sounded through the silence most musical, most
melancholy. Instead of the cold night rain, and the soughing of
the blast, the view disclosed a peaceful scene, the moonbeams lying
like sheets of snow upon the ruddy highlands, and the stars hanging
like lamps of gold from the dome of infinite blue. I never wearied
with contemplating the scene, for, contrasting with the splendours
around me, still stretched in sight the 'Slough of Despond,'
unhappy Zungomero, lead-coloured above, mud-coloured below,
wind-swept, fog-veiled, and deluged by clouds that dared not approach
these Delectable Mountains.</p>

<p>"All along our way we were saddened by the sight of clean-picked
skeletons, and here and there the swollen corpses of porters who
had perished in this place by starvation. A single large body which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
passed us but yesterday had lost fifty of their number by small-pox,
and the sight of their deceased comrades made a terrible impression.
Men staggering on, blinded by disease, mothers carrying on their
backs infants as loathsome as themselves. The poor wretches would
not leave the path, as every step in their state of failing strength was
precious. He who once fell would never rise again. No village
would admit a corpse into its precincts, no friend or relation would
return for them, and they would lie till their agony was ended by
the raven, the vulture, and the fox. Near every kraal were detached
huts set apart for those seized with the fell disease. Several of our
party caught the infection, and must have thrown themselves into
some jungle, for when they were missed we came back to look and
there was no sign of them. The further we went on, the more
numerous were the corpses. Our Moslems passed them with averted
faces, and with the low 'La haul!' of disgust, and a decrepit old
porter gazed and wept for himself. At the foot of the 'Goma Pass'
we found the outlying huts for the small-pox, and an old kraal,
where we made comfortable for the night. All around peeped the
little beehive villages of the Wakaguru and the Wakwivi.</p>

<p>"When we arrived at Rufuta I found that nearly all our instruments
had been spoilt or broken, the barometer had come to grief,
no aneroid had been sent from Bombay, and we had chiefly to get
on with two bath thermometers. Zonhwe was the turning-point of
the expedition's difficulties. The 17th of August, as we went on,
the path fell easily westwards down a long grassy jungly incline,
cut by several water-courses. At noon I lay down fainting in the
sandy bed of the Muhama nullah, meaning the 'Palmetto' or 'Fan-palm,'
and keeping Wazira and Mabruki with me, I begged Jack to
go on, and send me back a hammock from the halting-place. The
men, who were partly mutinous and deserting, suddenly came out
well; they reappeared, led me to a place where stagnant water was
found, and showed abundant penitence. At three o'clock, as Jack
did not send the hammock, I remounted and passed through another
'Slough of Despond' like Zungomero, and found two little villages,
and on a hillside my caravan halted, which had been attacked by
a swarm of wild bees. At Muhama we halted three days, and
forded the Makata, and pursuing our march next day, I witnessed
a curious contrast in this strange African nature, which is ever in
extremes, and where extremes ever meet, where grace and beauty
are seldom seen without a sudden change to a hideous grotesqueness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="From_Lovely_Scenery_to_Foetid_Marshes"></a>From Lovely Scenery to Fœtid Marshes.</i></div>

<p>"A splendid view charmed me in the morning. Above lay a sky
of purest azure, flaked with fleecy opal-tinted vapours floating high
in the empyrean, and catching the first roseate smiles of the unrisen
sun. Long lines, one bluer than the other, broken by castellated
crags and towers of the most picturesque form, girdled the far
horizon; the nearer heights were of a purplish-brown, and snowy
mists hung like glaciers about their folds. The plain was a park in
autumn, burnt tawny by the sun or patched with a darker hue where
the people were firing the grass&mdash;a party was at work merrily, as if
preparing for an English harvest home&mdash;to start the animals, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
promote the growth of a young crop, and, such is the popular belief,
to attract rain. Calabashes, palmyras, tamarinds, and clumps of
evergreen trees, were scattered over the scene, each stretching its
lordly form over subject circlets of deep dew-fed verdure. Here
the dove cooed loudly, and the guinea-fowl rang its wild cry, whilst
the peewit chattered in the open stubble, and a little martin, the
prettiest of its kind, contrasted by its nimble dartings along the
ground, with the vulture wheeling slowly through the upper air.
The most graceful of animals, the zebra and the antelope, browsed
in the distance; now they stood to gaze upon the long line of
porters, then, after leisurely pacing, with retrospective glances, in
an opposite direction, they halted motionless for a moment, faced
about once more to satiate curiosity, and lastly, terrified by their own
fancy, they bounded in ricochets over the plain.</p>

<p>"About noon the fair scene vanished as if by enchantment. We
suddenly turned northwards into a tangled mass of tall fœtid reeds, rank
jungle, and forest. One constantly feels, in malarious places, suddenly
poisoned as if by miasma; a shudder runs through the frame and a
cold perspiration, like a prelude for a fainting fit, breaks from the
brow. We came upon the deserted&mdash;once flourishing&mdash;village of
Wasagara, called Mbumi. The huts were torn and half burnt, the
ground strewed with nets and drums, pestles and mortars, cots and
fragments of rude furniture; the sacking seemed to be about ten
days old. Two wretched villagers were lurking in the jungle, not
daring to revisit the wreck of their own homes. The demon of
Slavery reigns over a solitude of his own creation; can it be, that
by some inexplicable law, where Nature has done her best for the
happiness of Mankind, Man, doomed to misery, must work out his
own unhappiness?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Ants"></a>Ants.</i></div>

<p>"Next day our path was slippery as mud, and man and beast
were rendered wild by the cruel stings of a small red ant and a
huge black pismire. They are large headed; they cannot spring,
but show great quickness in fastening themselves to the foot
or ankle as it brushes over them. The pismire is a horse-ant,
about an inch in length, whose bulldog head and powerful mandibles
enable it to destroy rats and mice, lizards and snakes; its
bite burns like a pinch of a red-hot needle. When it sets to work,
twisting itself round, it may be pulled in two without relaxing its
hold. As the people stopped to drink they were seized by these
dreadful creatures, and suddenly began to dance and shout like
madmen, pulling off their clothes, and frantically snatching at their
lower limbs. In the evening it was like a savage opera scene. One
would recite his Korán, another pray; a third told funny stories;
a fourth trolled out in a minor key lays of love and war that were
familiar to me upon the Scindian hills. This was varied by slapping
away the black mosquitoes, ridding ourselves of ants, and challenging
small parties of savages who passed us from time to time with bows
and arrows.</p>

<p>"Now we also began to suffer severely from the tzetze fly, which is
the true <i>Glossina morsitans</i>. It extended from Usagara westward as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
far as the Central Lakes. It has more persistency of purpose than
an Egyptian fly; when beaten off, it will return half a dozen times to
the charge. It cannot be killed except by a smart blow, and its
long sharp proboscis draws blood through a canvas hammock. The
sting is like an English horse-fly and leaves a lasting trace. This
land is eminently fitted for breeding cattle and for agriculture,
which, without animals, cannot be greatly extended. Why this
plague should have been placed here, unless to exercise human
ingenuity, I cannot imagine. Perhaps some day it will be exterminated
by the introduction of some insectiferous bird, which will
be the greatest benefactor that Central Africa ever knew. The
brown ant has cellular hills of about three feet high, whereas in
Somali-land they become dwarf ruins of round towers. When we
reached Rumuma the climate was new to us, after the incessant
rains of the Maritime Valley, and the fogs and mists of the Rufuta
range; but it was in extremes&mdash;the thermometer under the influence
of dewy gusts sank in the tent to 48° F., a killing temperature
in these latitudes to half-naked and houseless men. During
the day it showed 90° F.; the sun was fiery, and a furious south wind
coursed through skies purer and bluer than I had ever seen in
Greece or Italy.</p>

<p>"When we were ill our followers often mutinied, and would do
nothing, but stole and lost our goods, and would not work. Sometimes,
though they carried the water, they would refuse us any.
Jack was as ill as I was. We reached Rubeho, the third and
westernmost range of the Usagára Mountains, and here we were
welcomed with joy, and given milk and butter and honey, a real
treat. Here we were in danger of being attacked by the Wahúmba.
Next day a Caravan arrived, under the command of four Arab
merchants, of which Isa bin Hijji was most kind, and did us good
service. I was always at home when I got amongst Arabs. They
always treat me practically as one of themselves. They gave us
useful information for crossing the Rubeho range, and superintended
our arrangements. When they went away I charged them not to
spread reports of our illness. I saw them depart with regret. It
had really been a relief to hear once more the voice of civility
and sympathy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_War-cry_of_the_Wahumba"></a>The War-cry of the Wahúmba.</i></div>

<p>"Our greatest labour was before us. Trembling with ague,
with swimming heads, ears deafened by weakness, and limbs
that would hardly support us, we contemplated with dogged
despair the perpendicular scramble over the mountains and the
ladders of root and boulder, up which we and our starving, drooping
asses had to climb. Jack was so weak that he had three
supporters; I, having stronger nerves, managed with one. We
passed wall-like sheets of rock, long steeps of loose white soil and
rolling stones. Every now and then we were compelled to lie
down by cough and thirst and fatigue; and when so compelled, fires
suddenly appeared on the neighbouring hills. The War-cry rang loud
from hill to hill, and Indian files of archers and spearmen, streaming
like lines of black ants, appeared in all directions down the paths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
It was the Wahúmba, who, waiting for the Caravans to depart, were
going down to fall fiercely on the scattered villages in the lowlands,
kill the people, and to drive off the cattle, and plunder the villages
of Inengé. Our followers prepared to desert us, but, strange to say,
the Wahúmba did not touch us. By resting every few yards, and
clinging to our supporters, we reached the summit of this terrible
path after six hours, and we sat down amongst aromatic flowers and
bright shrubs, to recover strength and breath. Jack was almost in
a state of coma, and could hardly answer. The view disclosed a
retrospect of severe hardships past and gone.</p>

<p>"We eventually arrived, after more walking, at a place called the
Great Rubeho, where several settlements appeared, and where poor
Jack was seized with a fever fit and dangerous delirium; he became
so violent that I had to remove his weapons, and, to judge from
certain symptoms, the attack had a permanent cerebral effect. Death
appeared stamped upon his features, and yet our followers clamoured
to advance, <i>because it was cold</i>. This lasted two nights, when he
was restored and came to himself, and proposed to advance. I had
a hammock rigged up for him, and the whole Caravan broke ground.
We went on ascending till we reached the top of the third and
westernmost range of the Usagára Mountains, raised 5700 feet above
sea level, and we begin to traverse Ugogi, which is the halfway
district between the Coast and Unyanyembe, and stands 2760 feet
above sea level, and the climate of Ugogi pleases by its elasticity
and its dry healthy warmth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Evil_Reports"></a>Evil Reports.</i></div>

<p>"The African traveller's fitness for the task of Exploration depends
more upon his faculty of chafing under delays and kicking against
the pricks than upon his power of displaying the patience of a
Griselda or a Job. Another Caravan of coast Arabs arrived. They
brought news from the sea-board, and, wondrous good fortune, the
portmanteau containing books, which a porter, profiting by the confusion
when they were attacked by bees, had deposited in the long
grass at the place where I directed the slaves to look for it. Some
half-caste Arabs had gone forward and spread evil reports of us.
They said we had each one eye and four arms; we were full of
magic; we caused rain to fall in advance, and left droughts in our
rear; we cooked water-melons, and threw away the seeds, thus
generating small-pox; we heated and hardened milk, thus breeding
a murrain amongst cattle; our wire, cloth, and beads caused a
variety of misfortunes; we were Kings of the Sea, and therefore
white-skinned and straight-haired, as are all men who live in salt
water, and next year we would seize their land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Game"></a>Game.</i></div>

<p>"As far as <i>our</i> followers were concerned, there was not a soul to
stand by Jack and me except ourselves. Had anything happened
we must have perished. We should have been as safe with six as
with sixty guns, but six hundred stout fellows, well armed, might march
through the length and breadth of Central Africa." (Richard said
when the Government sent Gordon to Khartoum they failed because
they sent him <i>alone</i>. Had they sent him with five hundred soldiers
there would have been no war.) "And now a word to sportsmen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
this part of Africa. Let no future travellers make my mistake. I
expected great things without realizing a single hope. In the more
populous parts the woodman's axe and the hunter's arrows have
melted away game. Even where large tracks of jungle abound with
water and forage, the notes of a bird rarely strike the ear, and
during the day's march not a single large animal will be seen. In
places such as the park-lands of Dut'húmi, the jungles and forests
of Ugogi and Mgunda Mk'hali, the barrens of Usukuma, and the
tangled thickets of Ujiji, there is abundance of noble game&mdash;lions,
leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, wild cattle, giraffes, gnus, zebras,
quaggas, and ostriches; but the regions are so dangerous that a
sportsman cannot linger. There is miasma, malaria, want of food,
rarely water, no camels, and every porter would desert, whilst the
extraordinary expense of provision and of carriage would be the
work of a very rich man. As for us, we could only shoot on halting
days at rare periods, and there is nothing left but the hippopotamus
and the crocodile of the seacoast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Vermin"></a>Vermin.</i></div>

<p>"On the 8th of October we fell in with a homeward-bound
Caravan headed by Abdullah bin Nasib, who was very, very kind to
us. He kindly halted a day that we might send home a mail, and
gave me one of his riding animals, and would take nothing for it
except a little medicine. We left K'hok'ho, a foul strip of crowded
jungle, where we were stung throughout the fiery day by the tzetze
fly, swarms of bees, and pertinacious gadflies, where an army of
large poisonous ants drove us out of the tent by the wounds which
they inflicted between the fingers and other tender parts of the
body, till kettles of boiling water persuaded them to abandon us.
These ant-fiends made the thin-skinned asses mad with torture. In
this ill-omened spot my ass Seringe, the sole survivor of the riding
animals brought from Zanzibar, was so torn by a hyæna that it died
of its wounds, and fifteen of my porters deserted, so that I thought
that it was no use continuing my weary efforts and anxiety about
baggage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Hard_Jungle_March"></a>A Hard Jungle March.</i></div>

<p>"I gave Jack my good donkey, because he was worse than
I was, and I took one of the poor ones, and found that I must
either walk or leave valuable things behind. Trembling with weakness,
I set out to march the length of the Mdáburu jungle. The
memory of that march is not pleasant. The burning sun and the
fiery reflected heat arising from the parched ground&mdash;here a rough,
thorny, and waterless jungle, where the jessamine flowered and the
frankincense was used for fuel; there a grassy plain of black and
sun-cracked earth&mdash;compelled me to lie down every half-hour. The
water-gourds were soon drained by my attendant Beloch; and the
sons of Ramji, who, after reaching the resting-place, had returned
with ample stores for their comrades, hid their vessels on my
approach. Sarmalla, a donkey-driver, the model of a surly negro,
whose crumpled brow, tightened eyes, and thick lips, which shot out
on the least occasion of excitement, showed what was going on
within his head, openly refused me the use of his gourd, and&mdash;thirst
is even less to be trifled with than hunger&mdash;found ample reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
repent himself of the proceeding. Near the end of the jungle I
came upon a party of the Beloch, who, having seized upon a porter
belonging to a large Caravan of Wanyamwezi that had passed us on
that march, were persuading him, half by promises and half by
threats, to carry their sleeping mats and their empty gourds.</p>

<p>"Towards the end of that long march I saw with pleasure the
kindly face of Seedy Bombay, who was returning to me in hot haste,
leading an ass and carrying a few scones and hard-boiled eggs.
Mounting, I resumed my way, and presently arrived at the confines
of Mdáburu, where, under a huge calabash, stood our tent, amidst
a kraal of grass boothies, surrounded by a heaped-up ridge of
thorns.</p>

<p>"We left Ugogi and pursued our way to 'Mgunda Mk'hali,' a
very wild part, and at last got to Jiwella Mkoa, the halfway house.
We were cheered by the sight of the red fires glaring in the kraal,
but Jack's ass, perhaps frightened by some wild beast which we did
not see, reared high in the air, bucked like a deer, broke his girths,
and threw Jack, who was sick and weak, heavily upon the hard earth.
Our people had become so selfish that they always attended to
themselves first, and Said bin Salim, the leader, actually refused to
give us a piece of canvas to make a tent. Bombay made a memorable
speech: 'If you are not ashamed of your Master, O Said, be
at least ashamed of his servant,' which had such an effect that he
sent the whole awning, and refused the half which I sent back to
him.</p>

<p>"The three Tribes of this part are the Wagogo (the Wamasai), the
Wahúmba, and the Wakwafi, who are remarkable for their strength
and intelligence, and for their obstinate and untamable characters.
They only sell their fellow tribesmen when convicted of magic, or
from absolute distress, and many of them would rather die under the
stick than work. The Wagogo are thieves; they would rob during
the day, are importunate beggars, and specify their long lists of
wants without stint or shame. An Arab merchant once went out to
the Wahúmba to buy asses. He set out from Tura in Eastern
Unyamwezi, and traversing the country of the wild Watatúru,
arrived on the eighth day at the frontier district, I'ramba, where
there is a river which separates the tribes. He was received with
civility, but none have ever since followed his example.</p>

<p>"As we neared Unyanyembe the porters became more restive
under their light loads, their dignity was hurt by shouldering a pack,
and day after day, till I felt weary of life, they left their burdens upon
the ground. At Rubuga I was visited by an Arab merchant, who
explained something which had puzzled me. Whenever an advance
beyond Unyanyembe was spoken of, Said bin Salim's countenance
fell. The merchant asked me if I thought the Caravan was strong
enough to bear the dangers of the road between that and Ujiji, and
I replied that I did, but even if I did not, I should go on. The
perpetual risk of loss, discourages the traveller in these lands. In a
moment papers which have cost him months of toil may be scattered
to the winds. Collectors should <i>never</i> make them on the <i>march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
upwards</i>, but on their <i>leisurely return</i>. My field and sketch-books
were entrusted to an Arab merchant who preceded me to Zanzibar.
Jack sent down maps, papers, and instruments, and I my vocabularies,
ephemeris, and drawing-books, which ran no danger, except
from Hamerton's successor, who seemed careless.</p>

<p>"The hundred and thirty-fourth day from leaving the coast, after
marching over six hundred miles, we prepared to enter Kázeh. I was
met by Arabs who gave me the Moslem salutation, and courteously
accompanied me. I was to have gone to the <i>tembe</i> kindly placed at my
disposal by Isa bin Hijji and the Arabs met at Inengé, but by mistake
we were taken to that of Musa Mzuri, an Indian merchant, for whom
I bore an introductory letter, graciously given by H.H. the Sayyid
Majjid of Zanzibar. Here I dismissed the porters, who separated to
their homes. What a contrast between the open-handed hospitality
and the hearty good will of this truly noble race (Arabs), and the
niggardliness of the savage and selfish African! It was heart of flesh
after heart of stone. They warehoused my goods, disposed of my
extra stores, and made all arrangements for my down march on
return. During two long halts at Kázeh, Snay bin Amir never
failed to pass the evening with me, and, as he thoroughly knew
the country all around, I derived immense information from his
instructive and varied conversation.</p>

<p>"Here were the times when Jack was at such a disadvantage
from want of language; he could join in none of these things, and
this made him, I think, a little sour, and partly why he wished
to have an expedition of his own. Snay bin Amir was familiar with
the language, the religion, the manners, and the ethnology of all the
tribes. He was of a quixotic appearance, high featured, tall, gaunt,
and large limbed. He was well read, had a wonderful memory, fine
perceptions, and passing power of language. He was the stuff of
which I could make a friend, brave as all his race, prudent, ready to
perish for honour, and as honest as he was honourable. At Unyanyembe
the merchants expect some delay, because the porters, whether
hired at the coast or at Tanganyika, here disperse, and a fresh gang
has to be collected. When Snay bin Amir and Musa Mzuri, the
Indian, settled at Kázeh, it was only a desert; they built houses,
sunk wells, and converted it into a populous place. The Arabs here
live comfortably and even splendidly. The houses are single-storied,
but large, substantial, and capable of defence. They have splendid
gardens; they receive regular supplies of merchandise, comforts, and
luxuries from the coast; they are surrounded by troops of concubines
and slaves, whom they train to divers crafts and callings. The rich
have riding asses from Zanzibar, and the poorest keep flocks and
herds. When a stranger appears he receives <i>hishmat l'il gharib</i>,
or 'the guest welcome.' He is provided with lodgings, and introduced
by the host to the rest of the society at a general banquet. A drawback
to their happiness is the failure of constitution. A man who
escapes illness for a couple of months boasts, and, as in Egypt, no one
enjoys robust health. The residents are very moderate in their
appetites, and eat only light dishes that they may escape fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Description_of_Caravans_and_Difficulties"></a>Description of Caravans and Difficulties.</i></div>

<p>"From Unyanyembe there are twenty marches to Ujiji upon the
Tanganyika, seldom accomplished under twenty-five days. The two
greatest places are, first, Msene; the second is the Malagarázi river;
but now I bade adieu for a time to the march, the camp, and the
bivouac, and was comfortably housed close to my new friend, Shakyh
Snay bin Amir. You are all familiar with the Arab Kafilah and its
hosts of litters, horses, camels, mules, and asses; but the porter-journeys
in East Africa have, till this year of my arrival, escaped the
penman's pen. There are three kind of Caravans. These are the
Wanyamwezi, the Wasawahili free men, and lastly that of the Arabs.
That of the Arabs is splendid, and next to the Persian, he is the most
luxurious traveller in the East. A veteran of the way, he knows the
effects of protracted hardship and scarcity upon a wayfarer's health;
but the European traveller does not enjoy it, because it marches by
instinct rather than reason. It dawdles, it hurries, it lingers, losing
time twice. It is fatal to observation, and nothing will induce them
to enable an Explorer to strike into an unbeaten path, or to progress
a few miles out of the main road. Malignant epidemics attack
Caravans, and make you repent joining them. For the rest, the
porters, one and all, want to eat, drink, sleep, carry the lightest
load or none at all; for the slightest service they want double
pay; they lose your mules and your baggage; they steal what
they can; they desert when they can; they run away when
there is the slightest danger. When it is safe, they are mutinous
and insolent, because you are dependent on them. If you come
to a comfortable place, you cannot dislodge them; if you come
to a dangerous place, they will not give the necessary time for food
or sleep, or resting the animals. Everything is done to get as much
out of you as possible, to do as little as they can for it; gain and self
are almost their only thoughts. Bombay proved more or less an
exception. During our journey from start to finish, there was not
one, from Said bin Salim, the leader, to the very porter, except
Bombay and the two Goanese Catholics, who did not attempt to
desert.</p>

<p>"About five p.m. the camp was fairly roused, and a little low chatting
commences. The porters overnight have promised to start early,
and to make a long wholesome march; but, 'uncertain, coy, and
hard to please,' the cold morning makes them unlike the men of the
warm evening, and so one of them will have fever. In every
Caravan there is some lazy lout and unmanageable fellow whose sole
delight is to give trouble. If no march be in prospect, they sit
obstinately before the fire, warming their hands and feet, and casting
quizzical looks at their fuming and fidgety employer. If all be
unanimous it is vain to tempt them; even soft sawder is but 'throwing
comfits to cows,' and we return to our tent. If, however, there
be a division, a little active stimulating will cause a march. They
hug the fire till driven from it, when they unstack the loads piled
before our tents and pour out of camp or village. Jack and I,
when able, mount our asses; we walk when we can, but when
unable for either we are borne in hammocks. The heat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
ground, against which the horniest sole never becomes proof, tries
the feet like polished leather boots on a quarter-deck in the dog-days
near the Line. Sometimes, when in good humour, they are very
sportive. When two bodies meet, that commanded by an Arab claims
the road. When friendly caravans meet, the two <i>kirangozis</i> sidle
up with a stage pace, a stride and a stand, and, with sidelong looks,
prance till they arrive within distance; then suddenly and simultaneously
'ducking,' like boys 'giving a back,' they come to
loggerheads and exchange a butt violently as fighting rams. Their
example is followed by all with a rush and a crush, which might be
mistaken for the beginning of a fight; but it ends, if there be no
bad blood, in shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>"When a Unyamwezi guide is leader of a Caravan the <i>kirangozi</i>
deliberately raises his plain blood-red flag, and they all follow him.
If any man dares to go before him, or into any but his own place,
an arrow is extracted from his quiver to substantiate his identity at
the end of the march.</p>

<p>"The Wamrima willingly admit strangers into their villages, and
the Wazaramo would do the same, but they are constantly at feud
with the Wanyamwezi, and therefore it is dangerous hospitality.
My Goanese boys, being 'Christians,' that is to say, Roman
Catholics, consider themselves semi-European, and they will not
feed with the heathenry, so there are four different messes in the
Camp. The dance generally assumes, as the excitement increases,
the frantic semblance of a ring of Egyptian dervishes. The performance
often closes with a grand promenade, all the dancers being
jammed in a rushing mass, a <i>galop infernale</i>, with features of satyrs,
and gestures resembling aught but human. Sometimes they compose
songs in honour of me. I understand them, and the singers know
that I do. They sing about the Muzungú Mbáya, 'the wicked
white man;' to have called me a '<i>good</i> white man' would mean
that one was a natural, an innocent, who would be plucked and
flayed without flinching; moreover, despite my wickedness, it was
always to <i>me</i> that they came for justice and redress if any one bullied
or ill-treated them.</p>

<p>"The Caravan scene at night is often very impressive. The
dull red fires flickering and forming a circle of ruddy light in the
depths of the black forest, flaming against the tall trunks, and
defining the foliage of the nearer trees, illuminate lurid groups
of savage men, in every variety of shape and posture. Above,
the dark purple sky, studded with golden points, domes the
earth with bounds narrowed by the gloom of night. And, behold,
in the western horizon, a resplendent crescent, with a dim, ash-coloured
globe in its arms, and crowned by Hesperus, sparkling,
like a diamond, sinks through the vast space in all the glory and
gorgeousness of Eternal Nature's sublimest works. From such a
night, methinks, the Byzantine man took his device, the crescent
and the star.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Reptiles"></a>Reptiles.</i></div>

<p>"At Kázeh, as in Ugogi and everywhere else, the lodgings are a
menagerie of hens, pigeons, rats, scorpions, earwigs (the scorpions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
are spiteful), and in Ugogi there is a green scorpion from four to
five inches long, which inflicts a torturing wound. Here they say
that it dies after inflicting five consecutive stings, and kills itself if
a bit of stick be applied to the middle of its back. House crickets
and cockroaches are plentiful, as well as lizards, and frightful spiders
weave their webs. One does not count ticks, flies of sorts, bugs,
fleas, mosquitoes, and small ants, and the fatal bug of Miana, which
vary in size, after suction, from almost invisible dimensions to three-quarters
of an inch. The bite does not poison, but the irritation
causes sad consequences. Huts have to be sprinkled with boiling
water to do away with some of these nuisances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Ill_and_attended_by_a_Witch"></a>Ill and attended by a Witch.</i></div>

<p>"It is customary for Caravans proceeding to the Tanganyika to
remain for six weeks or two months at Unyanyembe for repose and
recovery from the labours they are supposed to have endured, to
enjoy the pleasures of 'civilized society,' to accept the hospitality
offered by the Arabs. All our party, except Jack and I, considered
Unyanyembi the end of the exploration, but to us it merely
meant a second point of departure easier than the first, because we
had gained experience. We had, however, a cause of delay. Jack
had become strong, but all the rest got ill. Valentine, my Goanese
boy, was insensible for three days and nights from bilious fever,
and when he recovered Gaetano got it and was unconscious. Then
followed the bull-headed slave, Mabruki, and lastly Bombay, while
the rest of the following, who had led a very irregular life, began to
pay the penalty of excess. They brought us a <i>mganga</i>, or witch,
who doctored us. However, we got distressing weakness, liver
derangement, burning palms, tingling soles, aching eyes, and alternate
chills of heat and cold, and we delayed till the 1st of December,
during which we learnt a lot of necessary things.</p>

<p>"My good Snay bin Amir sent into the country for plantains and
tamarinds, and brewed a quantity of beer and plantain wine. He
lent me valuable assistance concerning the country and language,
and we were able, through him, to learn all about the Nyanza or
Northern Lake, and the maps forwarded from Kázeh to the Royal
Geographical Society will establish this fact, as they were subsequently
determined, after actual exploration, by Jack. Snay bin
Amir took charge of all the letters and papers for home, and his
energy enabled me afterwards to receive the much-needed reserve
of supplies in the nick of time.</p>

<p>"On the 15th we went on to Yombo, where I remarked three
beauties who would be deemed beautiful in any part of the world.
Their faces were purely Grecian, they had laughing eyes, their figures
were models for an artist, like the bending statue that delights the
world, cast in bronze. These beautiful domestic animals smiled
graciously when, in my best Kinyamwezi, I did my <i>devoir</i> to the sex,
and a little tobacco always secured for me a seat in the 'undress
circle.'</p>

<p>"On the 22nd of December Jack came back, and we left on the
23rd of December, and marched to the district of Eastern Wilyankuru;
and there we again separated, and I went on alone to Muinyi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Chandi, and my people were very troublesome. Said bin Salim,
believing that my days were numbered, passed me on the last march
without a word. The sun was hot, and he and his party were
hastening to shade, and left me with only two men to carry the
hammock in a dangerous jungle, where shortly afterwards an Arab
merchant was murdered. On Christmas Day I mounted my ass,
passed through the western third of the Wilyankuru district, and was
hospitably received by one Salim bin Said, surnamed Simba the
Lion, who received me with the greatest hospitality. He was a
large, middle-aged man, with simple and kindly manners, and an
honesty of looks and words which rendered his presence extremely
prepossessing.</p>

<p>"The favourite dish in this country is the <i>pillaw</i>, or <i>pilaf</i>, here
called <i>pulao</i>; and here I want to digress. For the past century,
which concluded with reducing India to the rank of a British
province, the proud invader has eaten her rice after a fashion which
has secured for him the contempt of the East. He deliberately
boils it, and after drawing off the nutritious starch, or gluten, called
<i>conjee</i>, which forms the perquisite of the Portuguese or his pariah
cook, he is fain to fill himself with that which has become little
more nutritious than the prodigal's husks. Great, indeed, is the
invader's ignorance upon that point. Peace be to the manes of
Lord Macaulay, but listen to and wonder at his eloquent words:
'The Sepoys came to Clive, not to complain of their scanty fare,
but to propose that all the grain should be given to the Europeans,
who required more nourishment than the natives of Asia. The
thin gruel, they said, which was strained away from the rice, would
suffice for themselves. History contains no more touching instance
of military fidelity, or of the influence of a commanding mind.'
Indians never fail to drink the <i>conjee</i>. The Arab, on the other
hand, mingles with his rice a sufficiency of <i>ghee</i> to prevent the
extraction of the 'thin gruel,' and thus makes the grain as palatable
and as nutritious as Nature intended it to be&mdash;and dotted over with
morsels of fowl, so boiled that they shredded like yarn under the
teeth.</p>

<p>"Shaykh Masud boasted of his intimacy with the Sultan Msimbira,
whose subjects had plundered our portmanteau, and offered, on
return to Unyanyambe, his personal services in ransoming it. I
accepted with joy, but it afterwards proved that he nearly left his
skin in the undertaking. The climate of Kíríra, where I arrived on
the 27th of December, is called by the Arabs a medicine, and I
spent a delicious night in the cool Barzah after the unhealthy air of
Kázeh. Three marches more brought me to Msene, where I was
led to the <i>tembe</i> of one Saadullah, a low-caste Msawahili, and there
I found Jack, looking very poorly. We were received with great
pomp and circumstance; the noise was terrific, and Gaetano, Jack's
boy, was so excited by the scene that he fell down in an epileptic
fit, which fits returned repeatedly.</p>

<p>"On the 10th of January we left, and arrived at Mb'hali, and
passed through dense jungle, and eventually came to Sorora and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Kajjanjeri, and here we were freshly ill from miasma. About three
in the afternoon I was forced to lay aside my writing by an unusual
sensation of nervous irritability, which was followed by a general
shudder as in the cold paroxysm of fevers. Presently my extremities
began to weigh, and began to burn as though exposed to a glowing
fire, and my jack-boots became too tight and heavy to wear. At
sunset the attack reached its height. I saw yawning wide to
receive me&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Those dark gates across the wild<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That no man knows.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>My body was palsied, powerless, motionless; the limbs appeared to
wither and die; the feet had lost all sensation, except a throbbing
and a tingling as if pricked by needle points, the arms refused to be
directed by will, and to the hands the touch of cloth and stone was
the same. Gradually the attack spread upwards till it seemed to
compress my ribs, and stopped short there. This at a distance of
two months of any medical aid, and with the principal labour of the
expedition still in prospect! If one of us was lost, I said to myself,
the other might survive to carry home the results of the exploration,
which I had undertaken with the resolve either to do or die. I had
done my best, and now nothing appeared to remain for me but to
die as well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Partial_Paralysis_BlindnessmdashElephants"></a>Partial Paralysis. Blindness. Elephants.</i></div>

<p>"It was partial paralysis, brought on by malaria, well known in
India. I tried the usual remedies without effect, and the duration
of the attack presently revealed what it was. The contraction of
the muscles, which were tightened like ligatures above and below
the knees, and those λύταγούνατα [Greek: lytagounata], a pathological symptom which
the old Greek loves to specify, prevented me from walking to any
distance for nearly a year; the numbness of the hands and feet
disappeared more slowly, but the <i>Fundi</i> predicted that I should be
able to move in ten days, and on the 10th I again mounted my ass.
At Usagozi, Jack, whose blood had been impoverished, and whose
system had been reduced by many fevers, now began to suffer from
inflammation of the eyes, which produced an almost total blindness,
rendering every object enclouded by a misty veil. Goanese Valentine
suffered the same on the same day, and subsequently, at Ujiji, was
tormented by inflammatory ophthalmia. I suffered in a minor degree.
On the 3rd of February we debouched from a jungle upon the river
plain; the swift brown stream, there fifty yards broad, was swirling
through the tall wet grasses of its banks on our right hand, hard by
our track. Upon the off-side, a herd of elephants in Indian file
broke through the reed fence in front of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Crossing_of_the_Great_River_Malagarazi"></a>The Crossing of the Great River Malagarázi.</i></div>

<p>"The Malagarázi, corrupted by speculative geographers to Mdjigidgi&mdash;the
uneuphonious terminology of the 'Mombas Mission Map'&mdash;to
'Magrassie,' and to 'Magozi,' has been wrongly represented to
issue from the Sea of Ujiji. According to all travellers in these
regions, it rises in the mountains of Urundi, at no great distance
from the Kitangure, or river of Karagwah; but whilst the latter,
springing from the upper counterslope, feeds the Nyanza, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Northern Lake, the Malagarázi, rising in the lower slope of the
equatorial range, trends to the south-east, till it becomes entangled
in the decline of the Great Central African Depression&mdash;the hydrographical
basin first indicated in his address of 1852 by Sir Roderick
I. Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society of
London.<a name="FNanchor_2_99" id="FNanchor_2_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thence it sweeps round the southern base of Urundi,
and, deflected westwards, it disembogues itself into the Tanganyika.
Its mouth is in the land of Ukaranga, and the long promontory
behind which it discharges its waters is distinctly visible from
Kawele, the head-quarters of Caravans in Ujiji. The Malagarázi
is not navigable; as in primary and transition countries generally,
the bed is broken by rapids. Beyond the ferry the slope becomes
more pronounced, branch and channel islets of sand and verdure
divide the stream, and as every village near the banks appears to
possess one or more canoes, it is probably unfordable. The main
obstacle to crossing it on foot, over the broken and shallower parts
near the rock-bars, would be the number and the daring of the
crocodiles.</p>

<p>"The <i>mukunguru</i> of Unyamwezi is the severest seasoning-fever
in this part of Africa; it is a bilious-remittent lasting three days,
which reduces the patient to nothing, and often followed by a long
attack of tertian type. The consequences are severe and lasting,
even in men of the strongest nervous diathesis; burning and painful
eyes, hot palms and soles, a recurrence of shivering and flushing
fits, extremities alternately icy cold, then painfully hot and swollen,
indigestion, sleeplessness, cutaneous eruptions, fever sores, languor,
dejection, all resulting from torpidity of liver, from inordinate secretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
of bile, and shows the poison in the system. Sometimes the
fever works speedily; some become at once delirious, and die on
the first or second day.</p>

curiously fated. It was missed here, and came home to me in six years. Later
on, in 1863, it again disappeared for six years. It was stolen at Fernando Po in
1863; it was marked by somebody on a bit of parchment, "Burton's Original
Manuscript Diary, Africa, 1857." Colonel Maude, the Queen's Equerry, saw it
outside an old book-shop, was attracted by the label on the Letts's Diary. He
bought it for a few shillings, called on Lord Derby, and left it in the hall, forgetting
it. Lord Derby, coming down, saw the book, recognized my handwriting, wrote
to Colonel Maude for permission to restore the private diary to its rightful owner.
We happened to be in town. He kindly called and gave it back to us, so that
journal twice disappeared for six years, but had to come home. Who shall say
there is no destiny in this?</p></div>

as a triumph of geological hypothesis, was kindly forwarded to me by the discoverer:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"'My speculations as to the whole African interior being a vast watery plateau-land
of some elevation above the sea, but subtended on the east and west by much
higher grounds, were based on the following data:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"'The discovery in the central portion of the Cape Colony, by Mr. Bain, of
fossil remains in a lacustrine deposit of Secondary age, and the well-known
existence on the coast of loftier mountains known to be of a Palæozoic or Primary
epoch, and circling round the younger deposits, being followed by the exploration
of the Ngami Lake, justified me in believing that Africa had been raised from
beneath the ocean at a very early geological period; and that ever since that time
the same conditions had prevailed. I thence inferred that an interior network of
lakes and rivers would be found prolonged northwards from Lake Ngami, though
at that time no map was known to me showing the existence of such central reservoirs.
Looking to the west as to the east, I saw no possibility of explaining how
the great rivers could escape from the central plateau-lands and enter the ocean
except through deep lateral gorges, formed at some ancient period of elevation,
when the lateral chains were subjected to transverse fractures. Knowing that
the Niger and the Zaire, or Congo, escaped by such gorges on the west, I was
confident that the same phenomenon must occur upon the eastern coast, when
properly examined. This hypothesis, as sketched out in my 'Presidential Address'
of 1852, was afterwards received by Dr. Livingstone just as he was exploring
the transverse gorges by which the Zambesi escapes to the east, and the
great traveller has publicly expressed the surprise he then felt that his discovery
should have been thus previously suggested.'"</p>

<h4>OUR REWARD&mdash;SUCCESS.</h4>


<blockquote>

<p>"At length we sight the Lake Tanganyika, or the 'Sea of Ujiji.'
The route before us lay through a howling wilderness laid waste by
the fierce Watuta. Mpete, on the right bank of the Malagarázi
river, is very malarious, and the mosquitoes are dreadful. We
bivouacked under a shady tree, within sight of the ferry. The
passage of this river is considered dangerous on account of attacks
of the tribes. At one place I could only obtain a few corn cobs,
and I left the meat, with messages, for the rear. In the passages
of the river our goods and chattels were thoroughly sopped. After
a while, from a hillside we saw, long after noon, the other part of
our Caravan, halted by fatigue, upon a slope beyond a weary swamp;
a violent storm was brewing, and the sky was black, and we were
anxious and sorry about them.</p>

<p>"On the 13th February, after about an hour's march, I saw the
<i>Fundi</i> running forward, and changing the direction of the Caravan,
and I followed him to know <i>why</i> he had taken this responsibility
upon himself. We breasted a steep stony hill, sparsely clad with
thorny trees, which killed Jack's riding ass. Our fagged beasts
refused to proceed. 'What is that streak of light which lies below?'
said I to Bombay. 'I am of opinion,' said Bombay, 'that that <i>is
the</i> water you are in search of.' I gazed in dismay; the remains of
my blindness, the veil of trees, a broad ray of sunshine illuminating
but one reach of the lake, had shrunk its fair proportions. I began
to lament my folly in having risked life and lost health for so poor
a prize, to curse Arab exaggeration, and to propose an immediate
return to explore the Nyanza, or Northern Lake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Scenery"></a>Scenery.</i></div>

<p>"Advancing a few yards, the whole scene suddenly burst upon
my view, filling me with admiration, wonder, and delight. Nothing I
in sooth could be more picturesque than this first view of Tanganyika
Lake, as it lay in the lap of the mountains, basking in
the gorgeous tropical sunshine. There were precipitous hills, a
narrow strip of emerald green, a ribbon of glistening yellow sand,
sedgy rushes, cut by the breaking wavelets, an expanse of light,
soft blue water foam thirty to thirty-five miles wide, sprinkled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
by crisp tiny crescents of snowy foam, with a background of high
broken wall of steel-coloured mountain flecked and capped with
pearly mist, sharply pencilled against the azure sky, yawning chasms
of plum-colour falling towards dwarf hills, which apparently dip
their feet in the wave. One could see villages, cultivated lands,
fishermen's canoes on the water, and a profuse lavishness and
magnificence of Nature and vegetation. The smiling shores of
this vast crevasse appeared doubly beautiful to me after the silent
and spectral mangrove-creeks on the East African sea-board, and the
melancholy monotonous experience of desert and jungle scenery,
tawny rock and sun-parched plain, or rank herbage and flats of black
mire. Truly it was a revel for Soul and Sight! Forgetting toils,
dangers, and the doubtfulness of return, I felt willing to endure
double what I had endured; and all the party seemed to join with
me in joy. Poor purblind Jack found nothing to grumble at, except
the 'mist and glare before his eyes.' Said bin Salim looked exulting&mdash;<i>he</i>
had procured for me this pleasure; the monoculous <i>Jemadar</i>
grinned his congratulations, and even the surly Beloch made civil
salaams.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="In_an_Arab_Craft_to_Ujiji"></a>In an Arab Craft to Ujiji.</i></div>

<p>"As soon as we were bivouacked, I proceeded to get a solid-built
Arab craft, capable of containing thirty or thirty-five men,
belonging to an absent merchant. It was the second largest on the
lake, and being too large for paddling, the crew rowed, and at eight
next morning we began coasting along the eastern shore of the lake
in a north-westerly direction, towards the Kawele district. The
picturesque and varied forms of the mountains rising above and
dipping into the lake were clad in purplish blue, set off by the rosy
tints of the morning, and so we reached the great Ujiji. A few
scattered huts in the humblest beehive shape represent the Port
town. This fifth region includes the alluvial valley of the Malagarázi
river, which subtends the lowest spires of the highlands of Karagwah,
and Urundi, the western prolongation of the chain which has obtained,
<i>probably</i> from African tradition, the name of 'Lunar Mountains.'</p>

<p>"At Ujiji terminates, after twelve stages, the transit of the fifth
region. The traveller has now accomplished a hundred stages, which
with necessary rests, but not including detentions and long halts,
should occupy a hundred and fifty days. The distance, on account
of the sinuosities of the road, numbers nine hundred and fifty statute
miles, which occupied us seven and a half months on account of our
disadvantages and illnesses. Arab Caravans seldom arrive at the
Tanganyika, for the same reasons, under six months, but the lightly
laden and the fortunate may get to Unyamyembe in two and a half,
and to the Tanganyika in four months. It is evident that the African
authorities (this was written thirty-five years ago) have hitherto
confounded the Nyanza, the Tanganyika, and the Nyassa Lakes.
Ujiji was first visited in 1840 by the Arabs, and after that they
penetrated to Unyamwesi. They found it conveniently situated as
a central point from whence their factors and slaves could navigate
the waters, and collect slaves and ivory from the tribes upon its banks,
but the climate proved unhealthy, the people dangerous, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
coasting voyages ended in disaster. Ujiji never rose to the rank of
Unyamyembe, or Msene. Now, from May to September, flying
Caravans touch here, and return to Unyamyembe so soon as they
have loaded their porters. The principal tribes are the Wajiji, the
Wavínza, the Wakaránga, the Watúta, the Wabuha, and the Wáhha;
but the fiercest races in the whole land, and also the darkest, are the
Wazarámo, the Wajíji, and the Watatúru. The Lakists are almost
an amphibious race, are excellent divers, strong swimmers and fishermen,
and vigorous eaters of fish, and in the water they indulge in
gambols like sportive water-fowls, whether skimming in their hollow
logs, or swimming.</p>

<p>"It is a great mistake not to go as a Trader. It explains the
Traveller's motives, which are always suspected to be bad ones. Thus
the Explorer can push forward into unknown countries, will be civilly
received and lightly fined, because the host expects to see him or
his friends again: to go without any motive only induces suspicion,
and he is opposed in every way. Nobody believes him to be so
stupid as to go through such danger and discomfort for exploring or
science, which they simply do not understand.</p>

<p>"The cold damp climate, the over-rich and fat fish diet, and the
abundance of vegetables, which made us commit excesses, at first
disagreed with us. I lay for a fortnight upon the earth, too blind to
read or write, too weak to ride, too ill to converse. Jack was almost
as groggy upon his legs as I was, suffering from a painful ophthalmia,
and a curious contortion of the face, which made him chew sideways,
like an animal that chews the cud. Valentine was the same. Jack
and Valentine were always ill of the same things, and on the same
days, showing that certain climates affected certain temperaments
and not others. Gaetano ate too much and brought on a fever. I was
determined to explore the northern extremity of the lake, whence,
every one said, issued a large river flowing northwards, so I tried to
hire the only dhow or sailing craft, and provision it for a month's
cruise, and at last Jack went to look after it, and I was twenty-seven
days alone.</p>

<p>"I spent my time chiefly in eating, drinking, smoking, dozing.
At two or three in the morning I lay anxiously expecting the grey
light to creep through the door-chinks; then came the cawing of
crows, and the crowing of the village cocks. When the golden rays
began to stream over the red earth, torpid Valentine brought me
rice-flour boiled in water with cold milk. Then came the slavey with
a leafy branch to sweep the floor and to slay the huge wasps. This
done, he lit the fire, the excessive damp requiring it, and sitting over
it, he bathed his face and hands&mdash;luxurious dog!&mdash;in the pungent
smoke. Then came visits from Said bin Salim and the <i>Jemadar</i>
(our two headmen), who sat and stared at me, were disappointed
to see no fresh symptoms of approaching dissolution, told me so with
their eyes and faces, and went away; and I lay like a log upon my
cot, smoking, <i>dreaming of things past, visioning things present,</i> and
indulging myself in a few lines of reading and writing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="More_Scenery"></a>More Scenery.</i></div>

<p>"As evening approached, I made an attempt to sit under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
broad eaves of the <i>tembe</i>, and to enjoy the delicious spectacle of
this virgin Nature, and the reveries to which it gave birth&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'A pleasing land of drowsihed it was,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And of gay castles in the clouds that pass<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For ever flushing round a summer sky.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>"It reminded me of the loveliest glimpses of the Mediterranean;
there were the same 'laughing tides,' pellucid sheets of dark blue
water, borrowing their tints from the vinous shores beyond; the same
purple light of youth upon the cheek of the earlier evening; the same
bright sunsets, with their radiant vistas of crimson and gold opening
like the portals of a world beyond the skies; the same short-lived
grace and loveliness of the twilight; and, as night closed over the
earth, the same cool flood of transparent moonbeams, pouring on the
tufty heights and bathing their sides with the whiteness of virgin
snow.</p>

<p>"At seven p.m., as the last flush faded from the occident, the lamp&mdash;a
wick in a broken pot full of palm oil&mdash;was brought in. A dreary,
dismal day you will exclaim, a day that&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'lasts out a night in Russia,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When nights are longest there.'<br /></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="After_Twenty-seven_Days_Speke_returns"></a>After Twenty-seven Days Speke returns.</i></div>

<p>"On the 29th of March the rattling of matchlocks announced
Jack's return. He was moist, mildewed, and wet to the bone, and
all his things were in a similar state; his guns grained with rust, his
fireproof powder-magazine full of rain, and, worse than that, he had
not been able to gain anything but a promise that, <i>after three months,</i>
the dhow should be let to us for five hundred dollars. The very
dhow that had been promised to me whenever I chose to send for
it! The faces of my following were indeed a study.</p>

<p>"I then set to work to help Jack with his diaries, which afterwards
appeared in <i>Blackwood</i>, September, 1859, when I was immensely surprised
to find, amongst many other things, a vast horseshoe of lofty
mountains that Jack placed, in a map attached to the paper, near the
very heart of Sir R. Murchison's Depression. I had seen the mountains
growing upon paper under Jack's hand, from a thin ridge of hills
fringing the Tanganyika until they grew to the size given in <i>Blackwood</i>,
and Jack gravely printed in the largest capitals, 'This mountain
range I consider to be the true Mountains of the Moon;' thus
men <i>do</i> geography, and thus discovery is stultified. The poor fellow
had got a beetle in his ear, which began like a rabbit at a hole to
dig violently at the tympanum, and maddened him. Neither
tobacco, salt, nor oil could be found; he tried melted butter, and all
failing, he applied the point of a penknife to its back, and wounded
his ear so badly that inflammation set in and affected his facial
glands, till he could not open his mouth, and had to feed on suction.
Six or seven months after, the beetle came away in the wax. At last
I got hold of Kannena the Chief, and after great difficulty and
enormous extortion, I promised him a rich reward if he kept his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
word; for I was resolved at all costs, even if we were reduced to
actual want, to visit the mysterious stream. I threw over his
shoulders a six-foot length of scarlet broadcloth, which made him
tremble with joy, and all the people concerned in my getting the
dhow received a great deal more than its worth. I secured two large
canoes and fifty-five men.</p>

<p>"On the 11th of April, at four in the morning, I slept comfortably
on the crest of a sand-wave, and under a mackintosh escaped the
pitiless storm, so as to be ready to start lest they should repent, and
at 7.20 on the 12th of April, 1858, my canoe, bearing for the first
time on those dark waters&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'The flag that braved a thousand years<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The battle and the breeze,'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>stood out of Bangwe Bay, and, followed by Jack's canoe, we made for
the cloudy and storm-vexed north. The best escort to a European
capable of communicating with and commanding them, would be a
small party of Arabs, fresh from Hazramaut, untaught in the ways
and tongues of Africa. They would save money to the explorer,
and also his life. There were great rejoicings at our arrival at
Uvira, the <i>ne plus ultra</i>, the northernmost station to which merchants
have as yet been admitted. Opposite still, rose in a high
broken line the mountains of the inhospitable Urundi, apparently
prolonged beyond the northern extremity of the waters. Some say
the voyage is of two days, some say six hours; the breadth of the
Tanganyika here is between seven and eight miles.</p>

<p>"Now my hopes were rudely dashed to the ground. The stalwart
sons of the Sultan Maruta, the noblest type of Negroid seen near the
lake, visited me. They told me they had been there, and that the
Rusizi enters <i>into</i> and does not <i>flow out</i> of the Tanganyika. I felt
sick at heart. Bombay declared that Jack had misunderstood, and
<i>his</i> (Bombay's) informer <i>now</i> owned that he had never been beyond
Uvira, and never intended to do so. We stopped there nine days,
and there I got such a severe ulceration of the tongue that I could
not articulate. An African traveller may be arrested at the very
bourne of his journey, on the very threshold of his success, by a
single stage, as effectually as if all the waves of the Atlantic or the
sands of Arabia lay between him and it. Now Maruta and his
young giants claimed their blackmail, and also Kannena, and I had
to pay up. Slaves are cheaper here than in the market of Ujiji.
Gales began to threaten, and the crews, fearing wind and water,
insisted on putting out to sea on the 6th of May.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Fight"></a>A Fight.</i></div>

<p>"We touched at various stages and anchored at Mzimu, our
former halting-place, where the crew swarmed up a ladder of rock,
and returned with pots of palm oil. We left again at sunset; the
waves began to rise, the wind also, and rain in torrents, and it was
a doubt whether the cockleshell craft could live through the short
chopping sea in heavy weather. The crew was frightened, but held
on gallantly, and Bombay, a noted Agnostic in fine weather, spent
the length of that wild night in reminiscences of prayer. I sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
myself under my then best friend, my mackintosh, and thought of
the couplet&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'This collied night, these horrid waves, these gusts that sweep the whirling deep;<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What reck they of our evil plight, who on the shore securely sleep?'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>Fortunately the rain beat down the wind and sea, or nothing could
have saved us. The next morning Mabruki rushed into the tent,
thrust my sword into my hands, said the Warundi were upon us,
and that the crews were rushing to their boats and pushing them off.
Knowing that they <i>would</i> leave us stranded in case of danger, we
hurried in without delay; but presently no enemy appeared, and
Kannena, the Chief, persuaded them to re-land, and demand satisfaction
of a drunken Chief who had badly wounded a man, and then
there was a general firing and drawing of daggers. The crew
immediately confiscated the three goats that were for our return,
cut their throats, and spitted the meat upon their spears. Thus
the lamb died and the wolf dined; the innocent suffered, the plunderer
was joyed; the strong showed his strength, the weak his
weakness&mdash;as usual. I saw the sufferer's wounds washed, forbade
his friends to knead and wrench him as they were doing, and gave
him a purgative which did him good. On the second day he was
able to rise. This did not prevent the report at home that I had
killed the man.</p>

<p>"On the 11th of May we paddled round to Wafanya Bay, to
Makimoni, a little grassy inlet, where our canoes were defended
from the heavy surf. On the 12th we went to Kyasanga, and the
next night we spent in Bangwe Bay. We were too proud to sneak
home in the dark; we deserved the Victoria Cross, we were heroes,
braves of braves; we wanted to be looked at by the fair, to be
howled at by the valiant.</p>

<p>"On the 13th of May we appeared at the entrance of Kawele,
and had a triumphal entrance; the people of the whole country-side
collected to welcome us, and pressed waist-deep into the water.
Jack and I were repeatedly 'called for,' but true merit is always
modest; it aspires to 'Honour, not honours.'<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We regained the
old <i>tembe</i>, were salaamed to by everybody, and felt like a 'return
home.' We had expended upwards of a month boating about the
Tanganyika Lake. All the way down, we were like baited bears,
mobbed every moment; they seemed to devour us; in an ecstasy of
curiosity they shifted from Jack to me, and back again, like the
well-known ass between the bundles of hay. Our health palpably
improved. Jack was still deaf, but cured of his blindness; the
ulcerated mouth, which had compelled me to live on milk for
seventeen days, returned to its usual state, my strength increased,
my feet were still swollen, but my hands lost their numbness, and I
could again read and write. I attribute the change from the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and nights spent in the canoe, and upon the mud of the lake.
Mind also acted upon matter; the object of my Mission was now
effected, and I threw off the burden of grinding care, with which
the imminent prospect of a failure had before sorely laden me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although Richard did not get the meed of success in England, and
it has taken the world thirty-four years to realize the grandeur of
that Exploration, he was the Pioneer (without money, without food,
without men or proper escort, without the bare necessaries of life,
to dare and do, in spite of every obstacle, and every crushing thing,
bodily and mentally) who opened up that country. It is to <i>him</i>
that later followers, that Grant and Speke, and Baker and Stanley,
Cameron, and all the other men that have ever followed, owe it,
that he opened the oyster-shell for them, and they went in to take
the pearl. I do not want to detract from any other traveller's merits,
for they are all brave and great, but I <i>will</i> say that if Richard
Burton had had Mr. Stanley's money, escort, luxuries, porterage, and
white comrades, backed by influence, there would not have been
one single white spot on the whole map of the great Continent of
Africa that would not have been filled up. Owing to shameful
intrigues (which prospered none of the doers, but injured him, the
man who did all this), he got very few words of praise, and that
from a few, yet the World owes it to him now that there are Missions
and Schools and Churches, and Commerce, and peaceful Settlements,
and that anybody can go there. To <i>him</i> you owe "Tanganyika
in a Bath-Chair;" but Speke got the cheering of the gallery
and the pit, and Stanley inherited them. And here I insert the
innocent joy-bells of his own heart, as I found them scribbled on
the edge of his private journal, and anybody thinking of what he
had done and what he had passed through, can warmly enter into
his feelings of self-gratulation, so modestly hidden&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Caravan_arrives"></a>A Caravan arrives.</i></div>

<p>"The rainy monsoon broke up after our return to Kawele. The
climate became truly enjoyable, but it did not prevent the strange
inexplicable melancholy which accompanies all travellers in tropical
countries. Nature is beautiful in all that meets the eye; all is soft
that affects the senses; but she is a syren whose pleasures pall, and
one sighs for the rare simplicity of the desert. I never felt this
sadness in Egypt and Arabia; I was never without it in India and
Zanzibar. We got not one single word from the agents who were
to forward our things, and Want began to stare us in the face. We
had to engage porters for the hammocks, to feed seventy-five
mouths, to fee several Sultans, and to incur the heavy expenses of
two hundred and sixty miles' march back to Unyanyembe, so I had
to supplement with my own little patrimony. One thousand pounds
does not go very far, when it has to be divided amongst a couple
of hundred greedy savages in two and a half years. On the 22nd of
May musket-shots announced arrivals, and after a dead silence of
eleven months arrived a Caravan with boxes, bales, porters, slaves,
and a parcel of papers and letters from Europe, India, and Zanzibar.
Here we first knew of the Indian Mutiny. This good fortune
happened at a crisis when it was really wanted, but as my agent
could find no porters for the packages, he had kept back some,
and what he had sent me, were the worst. They would take us to
Unyamyembe, but were wholly inadequate for exploring the southern
end of the Tanganyika, far less for returning to Zanzibar, <i>viâ</i> the
Nyassa Lake and Kilwa, as I hoped to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Geographical_Remarks"></a>Geographical Remarks.</i></div>

<p>"At the time I write, the Tanganyika, though situated in the
unexplored centre of intertropical Africa, and until 1858 unvisited by
any European, has a traditionary history of its own, extending over
three centuries. The Tanganyika, 250 miles in length, occupies
the centre of the length of the African continent. The general
formation suggests the idea of a volcanic depression, while the
Nyanza is a vast reservoir formed by the drainage of the mountains.
The lay is almost due north and south, and the form a long oval
widening at the centre, and contracting at the extremities; the breadth
varies from thirty to thirty-five miles, the circumference about 550
miles, and the superficial area covers about 5000 square miles. By
the thermometers we had with us, the altitude was 850 feet above
sea-level, and about 2000 feet below the Nyanza or Northern Lake,
with high hill ranges between the lakes, which precluded a possibility
of a connection between the waters. The parallel of the northern
extremity of the Tanganyika nearly corresponds with the southern
creek of the Nyanza, and they are separated by an arc of the
meridian of about three hundred and forty-three miles. The waters
of the Nyanza are superior to those of Tanganyika. The Tanganyika
has a clear soft blue, like the ultramarine of the Mediterranean, with
the light and milky tints of tropical seas. I believe that the Tanganyika<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
receives and absorbs the whole river system, the network of
streams, nullahs, and torrents of that portion of the Central African
Depression, whose watershed converges towards the great reservoir.
I think that the Tanganyika, like the Dead Sea, <i>as</i> a reservoir,
supplies with humidity the winds which have parted with their
moisture in the barren and arid regions of the south, and maintains
its general level by the exact balance of supply and evaporation, and
I think it possible that the saline particles deposited in its waters may
be wanting in some constituent, which renders them evident to the
taste; hence the freshness.</p>

<p>"According to the Wajiji, from their country to the Marungú river,
which enters the lake at the <i>south</i>, there are twelve stages, numbering
one hundred and twenty stations, but at most of them provisions
are not procurable, and there are sixteen tribes and districts. The
people of Usige, <i>north</i> of the Tanganyika, say that six rivers fall into
the Tanganyika from the <i>east</i>, and <i>westernmost</i> is the Rusizi, and that
it is an <i>influent</i>.</p>

<p>"The Chief Kazembe is like a viceroy of the country lying south-west
of the Tanganyika, and was first visited by Dr. Lacerda,
Governor of the Rios de Sena, in 1798-99. He died, and his
party remained nine months in the country, without recording the
name and position of this African capital. A second expedition
went in 1831, and the present Chief was the grandson of Dr.
Lacerda's Kazembe. He is a very great personage in these parts,
and many Arabs are said to be living with him in high esteem.
Marungú, though dangerous, was visited by a party of Arab
merchants in 1842, who assisted Sámá in an expedition against a
rival. He compelled the merchants to remain with him; they had
found means of sending letters to their friends, they are unable to
leave the country, but they are living in high favour with the
Kazembe who enriched them. Of course there are people who
doubt their good fortune. I collect my details from a mass of Arab
<i>oral</i> geography.</p>

<p>"The 26th of May, 1858, was the day appointed for our departure
<i>en route</i> for Unyamyembe. Kannena had been drunk for a fortnight,
and was attacked by the Watuta, and fled. I heard of him no more.
He showed no pity for the homeless stranger&mdash;may the World show
none to him! I shall long remember my last sunrise look at Tanganyika,
enhanced by the reflection that I might never again behold it.
Masses of brown purple clouds covered the sunrise. The mists,
luminously fringed with Tyrian purple, were cut by filmy rays, and
the internal living fire shot forth broad beams like the spokes of a
huge aërial wheel, rolling a flood of gold over the light blue waters of
the lake, and a soft breeze, the breath of morn, awoke the waters
into life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Troublesome_Following"></a>Troublesome Following.</i></div>

<p>"The followers were very tiresome, mutinous, and inconsequent
in their anxiety to escape from Kannena and the fighting Watuta.
So, desiring the headman to precede me with a headstrong gang to
the first stage, and to send back men to carry my hammock and
remove a few loose loads, I breakfasted, and waited alone till the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
in the empty and deserted <i>tembe</i>; but no one came back, and the
utter misery depicted in the countenance of the Beloch induced me
to mount my <i>manchil</i>, and to set out carried by only two men. As
the shades of evening closed around us we reached the ferry of the
Ruche river, and we found no camp. The mosquitoes were like
wasps, and the hippopotamus bellowed, snorted, and grunted; the
roars of the crocodiles made the party miserable, as the porters
waded through water waist-deep, and crept across plains of mud,
mire, and sea-ooze. As it was too dark and dangerous to continue
the march, and that, had I permitted, they would have wandered
through the outer gloom, without fixed purpose, till permanently
bogged, I called a halt, and we snatched, under a resplendent moon
and a dew that soaked through the blankets, a few hours of sleep.
We were destitute of tobacco and food, and when the dawn broke,
I awoke and found myself alone; they had all fled and left me.
About two p.m., some of them came back to fetch me; but they
were so impertinent, ordering me to endure the midday heat and
labour, that I turned them out, and told them to send back their
master, Said bin Salim, in the evening or the next morning. Accordingly,
the next morning, the 28th of May, at nine o'clock,
appeared Said, the <i>Jemadar</i>, and a full gang of bearers. He was
impertinent too, but I soon silenced him, and then we advanced till
evening: for having tricked me he lost two days. Later on, a porter
placed his burden upon the ground and levanted, and being cognac
and vinegar, it was deeply regretted. Then the Unyamwezi guide
(because his newly purchased slave-girl had become footsore and
was unable to advance) cut off her head, lest out of his evil should
come good to another. The bull-headed Mabruki bought a little
slave of six years old. He trotted manfully alongside the porters,
bore his burden of hide bed and water gourd upon his tiny shoulders.
At first Mabruki was like a girl with a new doll, but when the
novelty wore off, the poor little devil was so savagely beaten that
I had to take him under my own protection. All these disagreeables
I was obliged to smooth down, because a traveller who
cannot utilize the raw material that comes to his hand, will make
but little progress. Their dread of the Wavinza increased as they
again approached the Malagarázi ferry. Here there are magnificent
spectacles of conflagration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Forest_on_Fire"></a>Forest on Fire.</i></div>

<p>"A sheet of flame, beginning with the size of a spark, overspreads
the hillside, advancing on the wings of the wind with the roaring
rushing sound of many hosts where the grass lay thick, shooting
huge forky tongues high into the dark air, where tall trees, the
patriarchs of the forest, yielded their lives to the blast, smouldering
and darkening, as if about to be quenched, where the rock afforded
scanty fuel, then flickering, blazing up and soaring again till, topping
the brow of the hill, the sheet became a thin line of fire, and gradually
vanished from the view, leaving its reflection upon the canopy
of lurid smoke studded with sparks and bits of live braise, which
marked its descent on the other side of the buttress.</p>

<p>"We were treated with cruel extortion at the crossing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Malagarázi, but the armies of ants, and an earthquake at 11.15 a.m.
on the 4th of June, which induced us to consent, was considered a
bad omen by my party. They took seven hours to transport us,
and at four p.m. we found ourselves, with hearts relieved of a heavy
load, once more at Ugogi, on the left bank of the river. Fortunately
I arrived just in time to prevent Jack from buying a little pig for
which he was in treaty, otherwise we should have lost our good
name amongst the Moslem population. On the 8th of June we
emerged from the inhospitable Uvinza into neutral ground, where
we were pronounced 'out of danger.' The next day, when in the
meridian of Usagozi, we were admitted for the first time to the
comforts of a village.</p>

<p>"On the 17th of June, in spite of desertions, we came to Irora,
the village of Salim bin Salih, who received us very hospitably. Here
we saw the blue hills of Unyanyembe, our destination. Next day we
got to Yombo, where we met some of our things coming up by the
coast, sent by the Consul of France&mdash;the French do things smartly&mdash;and
a second packet of letters. Every one had lost some friend
or relation near and dear to him. My father had died on the 6th
of last September, after a six weeks' illness, at Bath, and was buried
on the 10th, and I only knew it on the 18th of June&mdash;the following
year. Such tidings are severely felt by the wanderer who, living
long behind the world, is unable to mark its gradual changes, lulls
(by dwelling upon the past) apprehension into a belief that <i>his</i> home
has known no loss, and who expects again to meet each old familiar
face ready to smile upon his return, as it was to weep at his departure.</p>

<p>"We collected porters at Yombo, passed Zimbili, the village of
our former miseries, and re-entered Kázeh, where we were warmly
welcomed by our hospitable Snay bin Amir, who had prepared his
house and everything grateful to starving travellers. Our return
from Ujiji to Unyanyembe had been accomplished in twenty-two
stations, two hundred and sixty-five miles. After a day's repose, all the
Arab merchants called upon me, and I had the satisfaction of finding
that my last order on Zanzibar for four hundred dollars' worth of
cloth and beads had arrived, and I also recovered the lost table and
chair which the slaves had abandoned.</p>

<p>"During the first week following the march, we all paid the penalty
of the toilsome trudge through a perilous jungly country in the
deadly season of the year, when the waters are drying up under a
fiery sun, and a violent <i>vent de bise</i> from the east pours through the
tepid air like cold water into a warm bath. I again got swelling and
numbness of the extremities; Jack was a martyr to deafness and dimness
of sight, which prevented him from reading, writing, and observing
correctly; the Goanese were down with fever, severe rheumatism,
and liver pains; Valentine got tertian type, and was so
long insensible that I resolved to try the <i>tinctura Warburgii</i>. Oh,
Doctor Warburg! true apothecary! we all owe you a humble tribute
of gratitude; let no traveller be without you. The result was miraculous;
the paroxysms did not return, the painful sickness at once
ceased; from a death-like lethargy, sweet childish sleep again visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
his aching eyes; chief boon of all, the corroding thirst gave way to
appetite, followed by digestion. We all progressed towards convalescence,
and in my case, stronger than any physical relief, was the
moral effect of Success and the cessation of ghastly doubts and fears,
and the terrible wear and tear of mind. I felt the proud consciousness
of having done my best, under conditions, from beginning to
end, the worst and most unpromising, and that whatever future evils
Fate might have in store for me, it could not rob me of the meed
won by the hardships and sufferings of the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_sends_Speke_to_find_the_Nyanza"></a>He sends Speke to find the Nyanza.</i></div>

<p>"I had not given up the project of returning to the seaboard <i>viâ</i>
Kilwa. As has already been mentioned, the merchants had detailed
to me, during my first halt here, their discovery of a large lake,
lying about sixteen marches to the north; and, from their descriptions
and bearings, Jack laid down the water in a hand-map, and forwarded
it to the Royal Geographical Society. All agreed in claiming for it
superiority of size over the Tanganyika, and I saw that, if we could
prove this, much would be cleared up. Jack was in a much fitter state
of health to go. There was no need for two of us going, and I was
afraid to leave him behind at Kázeh. It is very difficult to associate
with Arabs as one of themselves. Jack was an Anglo-Indian, without
any knowledge of Eastern manners and customs and religion,
and of any Oriental language beyond broken Hindostanee. Now,
Anglo-Indians, as everybody knows, often take offence without
reason; they expect civility as their <i>due</i>, they treat all skins a shade
darker than their own as 'niggers,' and Arabs are, or can be, the
most courteous gentlemen, and exceedingly punctilious.<a name="FNanchor_2_101" id="FNanchor_2_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_101" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"Jack did not afterwards represent this fairly in <i>Blackwood</i>, October,
1859. He said I 'was most unfortunately quite done up, and most
graciously consented to wait with the Arabs and recruit my health;'
but in July, 1858, <i>writing on the spot</i>, he wrote, 'To diminish the
disappointment caused by the shortcoming of our cloth, and in not
seeing the whole of the Sea of Ujiji, I have proposed to take a flying
trip to the unknown lake, while Captain Burton prepares for our
return homewards.' Said bin Salim did all he could to thwart the
project, and Jack threatened him with the <i>forfeiture of his reward</i>
after he returned to Zanzibar. Indeed, he told him <i>it was already
forfeited</i>. He said 'he should certainly recommend the Government
<i>not to pay the gratuity, which the Consul had promised on condition
that he worked entirely for our satisfaction, in assisting the expedition
to carry out the arranged plans.</i>' How Jack reconciled himself to
misrepresent my conduct about the payment on reaching home, will
never be understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our followers were to receive <i>certain</i> pay in <i>any case</i>, which they
<i>did</i> receive, and a reward in <i>case they behaved well</i>; our asses,
thirty-six in number, all died or were lost; our porters ran away;
our goods were left behind and stolen; specimens of the fine
poultry of Unyamwezi, intended to be naturalized in England, were
bumped to death in the cases; our black escort were so unmanageable
as to require dismissal; the weakness of our party invited
attacks, and our wretched Beloch deserted us in the jungle, and
throughout were the cause of an infinity of trouble. Jack agreed
with me thoroughly, that it would be an <i>act of weakness</i> to pay the
<i>reward</i> of <i>ill-conduct</i>; instead of putting it down to generosity, they
would have put it down to fear, and they would have played the
devil with every future traveller; yet he used this afterwards as a
means to procure the Command of the next Expedition for himself,
and pointed it at me as a disgrace.</p>

<p>"By dint of severe exertion, Jack was able to leave Kázeh on the
10th of July. These northern kingdoms were Karágwah, Uganda,
and Unyoro. The <i>Mkámá</i>, or Sultan, of Karágwah was Armaníka,
son of Ndagára, who was a very great man. He is an absolute
Ruler, and governs without squeamishness. He receives the traveller
with courtesy, he demands no blackmail, but you are valued according
to your gifts. A European would be received with great kindness,
but only a rich man could support the dignity of the white
face. Corpulence is a beauty. Girls are fattened to a vast bulk
by drenches of curds and cream, thickened with flour, and are beaten
when they refuse, and they grow an enormous size.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Chief_Suna"></a>The Chief Suna.</i></div>

<p>"From the Kitangure river, fifteen stations conduct the traveller to
Kibuga, the capital of Uganda, the residence of its powerful despot,
Suna. The Chief of Uganda has but two wants, with which he troubles
his visitors. One is a medicine against Death, the other a charm
to avert thunderbolts, and immense wealth would reward the man
who would give him either of these two things. The army of Uganda
numbers three hundred thousand men; each brings an egg to muster,
and thus something like a reckoning of the people is made. Each
soldier carries one spear, two assegais, a long dagger, and a shield;
bows and swords are unknown. The women and children accompany,
carrying spare weapons, provisions, and water. They fight to
the sound of drums, which are beaten with sticks like ours; should
this performance cease, all fly the field.</p>

<p>"Suna, when last visited by the Arabs, was a red man, of about
forty-five, tall, robust, powerful of limb, with a right kingly presence,
a warrior carriage, and a fierce and formidable aspect. He always
carried his spear, and wore a long piece of bark-cloth from neck to
ground; he makes over to his women the rich clothes presented by
the Arabs. He has a variety of names, all expressing something
terrible, bitter, and mighty. He used to shock the Arabs by his
natural, unaffected impiety. He boasted to them that he was the
God of earth, as their Allah was the Lord of heaven. He murmured
loudly against the abuse of lightning, and claimed from his
subjects divine honours, such as the facile Romans yielded to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Emperors. His sons, numbering more than a hundred, were confined
in dungeons; the heir <i>elect</i> was dragged from his chains to
fill a throne, and the cadets linger through their dreadful lives till
death releases them. His female children were kept under the
most rigid surveillance within the palace; but he had one favourite
daughter, named Nasurú, whose society was so necessary to him, that
he allowed her to appear with him in public.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_collects_a_Vocabulary"></a>Richard collects a Vocabulary.</i></div>

<p>"Suna encouraged, by gifts and attentions, the Arab merchants to
trade in his capital, but the distance has prevented more than half a
dozen caravans from reaching him; yet all loudly praised his courtesy
and hospitality. My friend Snay Bin Amir paid him a visit in 1852.
He was received in the audience hall, outside which were two
thousand guards, armed only with staves. He was allowed to retain
his weapons. He saluted the Chief, who motioned his guest to sit in
front of him. Two spears were close to his hand. He has a large
and favourite dog, resembling an Arab greyhound. The dog was,
and is always, by his side. The ministers and the women were also
present, but placed so that they could only see the visitor's back.
He was eager of news. When the despot rose, all dispersed. At
the second visit, Snay presented his blackmail, and it was intimated
to the 'King's Stranger' that he might lay hands upon whatever
he pleased, animate or inanimate; but Snay was too wise to avail
himself of this privilege. There were four interviews, in which Suna
inquired much about the Europeans, and was anxious for a close
alliance with the Sultan of Zanzibar. He treated Snay very generously;
but Snay, when he could without offence, respectfully declined
things. Like all African Chiefs, the despot considered these
visits as personal honours paid to himself. It would depend, however,
upon his ingenuity and good fortune whether a traveller would
be allowed to explore further, and perhaps the best way would
have been to buy or to build boats upon the nearest western shore,
with Suna's permission. During Jack's absence, I collected specimens
of the multitudinous dialects. Kisawahili, or coast language,
into which the great South African family here divides itself, is the
most useful, because most generally known, and, once mastered, it
renders the rest easy. With the aid of the slaves, I collected about
five hundred words in the three principal dialects upon this line of
road&mdash;the Kisawahili, the Kizaramo, which included the Kik'hutu,
and the Kinyamwezi. It was very difficult, for they always used to
answer me, 'Verily in the coast tongue, words never take root, nor
do they ever bear branches.' The rest of my time was devoted to
preparation for journeying, and absolute work&mdash;tailoring, sail-making,
umbrella-mending, etc.</p>

<p>"On the 14th of July the last Arab Caravan left Unyanyembe, under
the command of Sayf bin Said el Wardi. He offered to convey letters
and anything else, and I forwarded the useless surveying instruments,
manuscripts, maps, field and sketch books, and reports to the Royal
Geographical Society. This excitement over, I began to weary of
Kázeh.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Differences begin between Speke and Richard.</span></h4>


<p>"Already I was preparing to organize a little expedition to K'hokoro
and the southern provinces, when unexpectedly&mdash;in these lands a
few cries and gun-shots are the only credible precursors of a Caravan&mdash;on
the morning of the 25th of August reappeared Jack.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Speke_returns_and_the_Differences_arose"></a>Speke returns and the Differences arose.</i></div>

<p>"At length Jack had been successful. His 'flying trip' had led
him to the northern water, and he had found its dimensions surpassing
our most sanguine expectations. We had scarcely, however,
breakfasted before he announced to me the startling fact that 'he
had discovered the sources of the White Nile.' It was an inspiration
perhaps. The moment he sighted the Nyanza, he felt at once no
doubt but that the 'lake at his feet gave birth to that interesting
river, which has been the subject of so much speculation and the
object of so many explorers.' The fortunate discoverer's conviction
was strong. His reasons were weak, were of the category alluded
to by the damsel Lucetta, when justifying her penchant in favour of
the 'lovely gentleman,' Sir Proteus&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'I have no other but a woman's reason&mdash;<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I think him so because I think him so;'<a name="FNanchor_3_102" id="FNanchor_3_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_102" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>and probably his Sources of the Nile grew in his mind as his
Mountains of the Moon had grown under his hand.</p>

<p>"His main argument in favour of the lake representing the great
reservoir of the White Nile was that the 'principal men' at the
southern extremity ignored the extent northward. 'On my inquiring
about the lake's length,' said Jack, 'the man (the greatest traveller in
the place) faced to the north, and began nodding his head to it. At
the same time he kept throwing forward his right hand, and making
repeated snaps of his fingers, endeavouring to indicate something
immeasurable; and added that nobody knew, but he thought it
probably extended to the end of the world.' Strongly impressed
by this valuable statistical information, Jack therefore placed the
northern limit about 4° to 5° N. lat., whereas the Egyptian Expedition
sent by the late Mohammed Ali Pacha, about twenty years ago, to
explore the coy Sources, reached 3° 22' N. lat. The expedition
therefore ought to have sailed fifty miles upon the Nyanza Lake.
On the contrary, from information derived on the spot, that
expedition placed the fountains at one month's journey&mdash;three
hundred to three hundred and fifty miles&mdash;to the south-east, or
upon the northern counterslope of Mount Kenia.</p>

<p>"Whilst marching to the coast, Jack&mdash;he tells us&mdash;was assured
by a 'respectable Sawahili merchant that when engaged in traffic,
some years previously, to the northward of the Line and the westward
of this lake, he had heard it commonly reported that large
vessels frequented the northern extremity of these waters, in which
the officers engaged in navigating them used sextants and kept a log,
precisely similar to what is found in vessels on the ocean. Query,
Could this be in allusion to the expedition sent by Mohammed Ali
up the Nile in former years?' (<i>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical
Society</i>, May 9, 1859). Clearly, if Abdullah bin Nasib, the Msawahili
alluded to, had reported these words, he merely erred. The
Egyptian Expedition, as has been shown, not only did not find,
they never even heard of a lake. But not being present at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
conversation, besides the geographical difficulties which any scientific
geographer could see at a glance, I am tempted to assign further
explanation. Jack, wholly ignorant of Arabic, was obliged to
depend upon 'Bombay.' Bombay misunderstood Jack's bad Hindostani.
He then mistranslated the words in Kisawahili to the best
African, who, in his turn, passed it on in a still wilder dialect to the
noble savages who were under cross-examination. My experience is
that words in journeys to and fro are liable to the severest accidents
and have often bad consequences, and now I felt that an <i>influent</i>
of the Nyanza was described as an <i>effluent</i>, and the real original
and only genuine White Nile would remain thus described for
years to our shame, and it is easy to see how the blunder originated.</p>

<p>"The Arabic <i>bahr</i> and the Kisawahili <i>báhari</i> are equally applicable,
in vulgar parlance, to a river or sea, a lake or river. Traditions
concerning a Western sea&mdash;the to them now unknown Atlantic&mdash;over
which the white men voyage, are familiar to many East Africans;
I have heard at Harar precisely the same report concerning the log
and sextants. Either, then, Abdullah bin Nasib confounded, or
Jack's '<i>interrupter</i>' caused <i>him</i> to confound, the Atlantic and the
lake. In the maps forwarded from Kázeh by Jack, the river Kivira
was, after ample inquiry, made a western <i>influent</i> of the Nyanza
Lake. In the map appended to the paper in <i>Blackwood</i>, before
alluded to, it has become an <i>effluent</i>, and the only minute concerning
so very important a modification is, 'This river (although I must
confess at first I did not think so) is the Nile itself.'</p>

<p>"Beyond the assertion, therefore, that no man had visited the
north, and the appearance of 'sextants' and 'logs' upon the
waters, there is not a shade of proof <i>pro</i>. Far graver considerations
lie on the <i>con</i> side; the reports of the Egyptian Expedition, and the
dates of the several inundations which&mdash;as will presently appear&mdash;alone
suffice to disprove the possibility of the Nyanza causing the
flood of the Nile. It is doubtless a satisfactory thing to disclose
to an admiring public of 'Statesmen, Churchmen, Missionaries,
Merchants, and more particularly Geographers,' the 'solution of
a problem, which it had been the first geographical desideratum of
many thousand years to ascertain, and the ambition of the first
Monarchs in the World to unravel' (<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
October, 1859). But how many times since the days of a certain
Claudius Ptolemæius, surnamed Pelusiota, have not the fountains
of the White Nile been discovered and re-discovered after this
fashion?</p>

<p>"What tended at the time to make me the more sceptical, was the
substantial incorrectness of the geographical and other details
brought back by Jack. This was natural enough. The first thing
reported to me was 'the falsehood of the Arabs at Kázeh, who
had calumniated the good Sultan Muhayya, and had praised
the bad Sultan Machunda:' subsequent inquiries proved their rigid
correctness. Jack's principal informant was one Mansur bin Salim,
a half-caste Arab, who had been flogged out of Kázeh by his compatriots;
he pronounced Muhayya to be a 'very excellent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
obliging person,' and of course he was believed. I then heard
a detailed account 'of how the Caravan of Salim bin Rashid had
been attacked, beaten, captured, and detained at Ukerewe, by its
Sultan Machunda.' The Arabs received the intelligence with a
smile of ridicule, and in a few days Salim bin Rashid appeared in
person to disprove the report. These are but <i>two</i> cases of <i>many</i>.
And what knowledge of Asiatic customs can be expected from the
writer of the following lines?&mdash;'The Arabs at Unyanyembe had
advised my donning their habit for the trip in order to attract less
attention; a vain precaution, which I believe they suggested more
to gratify their own vanity in <i>seeing an Englishman lower himself to
their position</i> (?), than for any benefit that I might receive by doing
so' (<i>Blackwood, loco cit.</i>). This galamatias of the Arabs! the
haughtiest and the most clannish of all Oriental peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_soliloquizes_on_Spekes_Change_of_Front"></a>Richard soliloquizes on Speke's Change of Front.</i></div>

<p>"Jack changed his manners to me from this date. His difference
of opinion was allowed to alter companionship. After a few days
it became evident to me that not a word could be uttered upon the
subject of the lake, the Nile, and his <i>trouvaille</i> generally without
offence. By a tacit agreement it was, therefore, avoided, and I
should never have resumed it, had Jack not stultified the results of
my expedition by putting forth a claim which no geographer can
admit, and which is at the same time so weak and flimsy, that no
geographer has yet taken the trouble to contradict it.</p>

<p>"Now, for the first time, although I had pursued my journey
under great provocations from time to time, I never realized what
an injury I had done the Expedition publicly, as well as myself, by
not travelling alone, or with Arab companions, or at least with a less
crooked-minded, cantankerous Englishman. He is energetic, he
is courageous and persevering. He distinguished himself in the
Punjaub Campaign. I first found him in Aden with a three years'
furlough. His heart was set on spending two years of his leave in
collecting animals north of the Line in Africa. He never <i>thought</i>
in any way of the Nile, and he was astonished at <i>my</i> views, which
he deemed impracticable. He had no qualifications for the excursion
that he proposed to himself, except that of being a good sportsman.
He was ignorant of the native races in Africa, he had brought with
him about £400 worth of cheap and useless guns and revolvers,
swords and cutlery, beads and cloth, which the Africans would have
rejected with disdain. He did not know any of the manners and
customs of the East; he did not know any language except a little
Anglo-Hindostani; he did not <i>even</i> know the names of the Coast
Towns. I saw him engage, as protectors or <i>Abbans</i>, any Somali
donkey-boys who could speak a little English. I saw that he was
going to lose his money and his 'leave' and his life. Why should I
have cared? I do not know; but as 'virtue is really its own
reward,' I did so, and have got a slap in the face, which I suppose
I deserve. I first took him to Somali-land; then I applied
officially for him, and thus saved his furlough and his money by
putting him on full service. You would now think, to see his
conduct, that the case was reversed&mdash;that he had taken me, not I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
him; whereas I can confidently say that, except his shooting and
his rags of Anglo-Hindostani, I have taught him everything he
knows. He had suffered in purse and person at Berberah, and
though he does not know French or Arabic, though he is not a
man of science, nor an acute astronomical observer, I thought it
only just to offer him the opportunity of accompanying me as second
in command into Africa. He quite understood that it <i>was</i> in a
subordinate capacity, as we should have to travel amongst Arabs,
Belochs, and Africans, whose language he did not know. The
Court of Directors refused me, but I obtained it by an application,
to the Local Authorities at Bombay. He knew by experience in
Somali-land what travelling with <i>me</i> meant, and yet he was only too
glad to come.</p>

<p>"I have also done more than Jack in the cause. The Royal
Geographical Society only allowed us £1000, and sooner than fail
I have sacrificed a part of the little patrimony I inherited, and my
reward is, that I and my expenditure, and the cause for which I
have sacrificed everything, are made ridiculous."</p></blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Few Details of the Lakes for Geographers.</span></h4>


<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="For_Geographers"></a>For Geographers.</i></div>

<p>"I will here offer to the reader a few details concerning the lake
in question; they are principally borrowed from Jack's diary, carefully
corrected, however, by Snay bin Amir, Salim bin Rashid,<a name="FNanchor_4_103" id="FNanchor_4_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_103" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and other
merchants at Kázeh.</p>

<p>"This fresh-water sea is known throughout the African tribes as
Nyanza, and the similarity of the sound to 'Nyassa,' the indigenous
name of the little Maravi, or Kilwa Lake, may have caused in part
the wild confusion in which speculative geographers have involved
the Lake Regions of Central Africa. The Arabs, after their fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of deriving comprehensive names from local and minor features, call
it Ukerewe, in the Kisukuma dialect meaning the 'place of Kerewe'
(Kelewe), an islet. As has been mentioned, they sometimes attempt
to join by a river, a creek, or some other theoretical creation, the
Nyanza with the Tanganyika, the altitude of the former being 3750
feet above sea-level, or 1900 feet above the latter, and the mountain
regions which divide the two having been frequently travelled over
by Arab and African caravans. Hence the name Ukerewe has
been transferred in the 'Mombas Mission Map' to the northern
waters of the Tanganyika. The Nyanza, as regards name, position,
and even existence, has hitherto been unknown to European
geographers; but, as will presently appear, descriptions of this sea
by native travellers have been unconsciously transferred by our
writers to the Tanganyika to Ujiji, and even to the Nyassa of
Kilwa.</p>

<p>"M. Brun-Rollet ('Le Nil Blanc et le Soudan,' p. 209) heard
that on the west of the Padongo tribe&mdash;which he places to the south
of Mount Kambirah, or below 1° S. lat.&mdash;lies a great lake, from
whose northern extremity issues a river whose course is unknown.
In a map appended to his volume this water is placed between
1° S. and 3° N. lat., and about 25° 50' E. long. (Greenwich), and
the reservoir is made an influent of the White Nile.</p>

<p>"Bowditch ('Discoveries of the Portuguese,' pp. 131, 132), when
speaking of the Maravi Lake (the Nyassa), mentions that the
'negroes or the Moors of Melinde' have mentioned a great water
which is known to reach Mombaça, which the Jesuit missionaries
conjectured to communicate with Abyssinia, and of which Father
Lewis Marianna, who formerly resided at Tete, recommended a
discovery, in a letter addressed to the Government at Goa, which
is still preserved among the public archives of that city. Here the
confusion of the Nyanza, to which there was of old a route from
Mombasah, with the Nyassa is apparent.</p>

<p>"At the southern point, where the Muingwira river falls into the
tortuous creek, whose surface is a little archipelago of brown rocky
islets crowned with trees and emerging from the blue waters, the
observed latitude of the Nyanza Lake is 2° 24' S.; the longitude by
dead reckoning from Kázeh is E. long. 33° and nearly due north,
and the altitude by B. P. thermometer 3750 feet above sea-level.
Its extent to the north is unknown to the people of the southern
regions, which rather denotes some difficulty in travelling than any
great extent. They informed Jack that from Mwanza to the
southern frontier of Karágwah is a land journey of one month, or
a sea voyage of five days towards north-north-west, and then to the
north. They also pointed out the direction of Unyoro N. 20° W.
The Arab merchants of Kázeh have seen the Nyanza opposite
Weranhanja, the capital district of Armanika, King of Karágwah,
and declares that it receives the Kitangure river, whose mouth has
been placed about the equator.</p>

<p>"Beyond that point all is doubtful. The merchants have heard
that Suna, the late despot of Uganda, built <i>matumbi</i>, or undecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
vessels, capable of containing forty or fifty men, in order to attack
his enemies, the Wasoga, upon the creeks which indent the western
shores of the Nyanza. This, if true, would protract the lake to
between 1° and 1° 30' of N. lat, and give it a total length of about
4°, or 250 miles. This point, however, is still involved in the
deepest obscurity. Its breadth was estimated as follows:&mdash;A hill
about two hundred feet above the water-level, shows a conspicuous
landmark on the eastern shore, which was set down as forty miles
distant. On the south-western angle of the line from the same
point, ground appeared; it was not, however, perceptible north-west.
The total breadth, therefore, has been assumed at eighty miles&mdash;a
figure which approaches the traditions unconsciously chronicled by
European geographers. In the vicinity of Usoga, the lake, according
to the Arabs, broadens out; of this, however, and in fact of all the
formation north of the equator, it is at present impossible to arrive
at certainty.</p>

<p>"The Nyanza is an elevated basin or reservoir, the recipient of
the surplus monsoon rain, which falls in the extensive regions of
the Wamasai and their kinsmen to the east, the Karágwah line
of the Lunar Mountains to the west, and to the south Usukuma,
or Northern Unyamwezi. Extending to the equator in the central
length of the African peninsula, and elevated above the limits of
the depression in the heart of the continent, it appeared to be a
gap in the irregular chain which, running from Usumbara and
Kilima-ngao to Karágwah, represents the formation anciently termed
the Mountains of the Moon. The physical features, as far as they
were observed, suggest this view. The shores are low and flat,
dotted here and there with little hills; the smaller islands also are
hill-tops, and any part of the country immediately on the south
would, if inundated to the same extent, present a similar aspect.</p>

<p>"The lake lies open and elevated, rather like the drainage and the
temporary deposit of extensive floods than a volcanic creation like
the Tanganyika, a long narrow mountain-girt basin. The waters
are said to be deep, and the extent of the inundation about the
southern creek proves that they receive during the season an important
accession. The colour was observed to be clear and blue,
especially from afar in the early morning; after nine a.m., when the
prevalent south-east wind arose, the surface appears greyish or of a
dull milky white, probably the effect of atmospheric reflection. The
tint, however, does not, according to travellers, ever become red or
green like the waters of the Nile. But the produce of the lake
resembles that of the river in its purity; the people living on the
shores prefer it, unlike that of the Tanganyika, to the highest and
clearest springs; all visitors agree in commending its lightness and
sweetness, and declare that the taste is rather of river or of rain
water, than resembling the soft slimy produce of stagnant, muddy
bottoms, or the rough harsh flavour of melted ice and snow.</p>

<p>"From the southern creek of the Nyanza, and beyond the archipelago
of neighbouring islets, appear the two features which have
given to this lake the name of Ukerewe. The Arabs call them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
'Jezirah'&mdash;an ambiguous term, meaning equally insula and peninsula&mdash;but
they can scarcely be called islands. The high and rocky
Mazita to the east, and the comparatively flat Ukerewe on the west,
are described by the Arabs as points terminating seawards in bluffs,
and connected with the eastern shore by a low neck of land&mdash;probably
a continuous reef&mdash;flooded during the rains, but never so deeply as
to prevent cattle fording the isthmus. The northern and western
extremities front deep water, and a broad channel separates them
from the southern shore, Usukuma. The Arabs, when visiting
Ukerewe or its neighbour, prefer hiring the canoes of the Wasakuma,
and paddling round the south-eastern extremity of the Nyanza, to
exposing their property and lives by marching through the dangerous
tribes of the coast.</p>

<p>"The altitude, the conformation of the Nyanza Lake, the argilaceous
colour and the sweetness of its waters, combine to suggest that it may
be one of the feeders of the White Nile. In the map appended to
M. Brun Rollet's volume, before alluded to, the large water west
of the Padongo tribe, which clearly represents the Nyanza or
Ukerewe, is, I have observed, made to drain northwards into the
Fitri Lake, and eventually to swell the main stream of the White
River. The details supplied by the Egyptian Expedition, which,
about twenty years ago, ascended the White River to 3° 22' N. lat.
and 31° 30' E. long., and gave the general bearing of the river
from that point of its source as south-east, with a distance of one
month's journey, or from three hundred to three hundred and fifty
miles, would place the actual sources 2° S. lat. and 35° E. long., or
in 2° eastward of the southern creek of the Nyanza Lake. This
position would occupy the northern counterslope of the Lunar
Mountains, the upper watershed of the high region whose culminating
apices are Kilima-ngao, Kenia, and Doengo Engai. The
distance of these peaks from the coast as given by Dr. Krapf
must be considerably reduced, and little authority can be attached
to his river Tumbiri.<a name="FNanchor_5_104" id="FNanchor_5_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_104" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The site, supposed by Mr. Macqueen
(<i>Proceedings of the Geographical Society of London</i>, January 24th, 1859)
to be at least twenty-one thousand feet above the level of the sea,
and consequently three or four thousand feet above the line of
perpetual congelation, would admirably explain the two most ancient
theories concerning the source of the White River, namely, that it
arises in snowy regions, and that its inundation is the result of
tropical rains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is impossible not to suspect that between the upper portion of
the Nyanza and the watershed of the White Nile there exists a
longitudinal range of elevated ground, running from east to west&mdash;a
<i>furca</i> draining northwards into the Nile and southwards into
the Nyanza Lake&mdash;like that which separates the Tanganyika from
the Maravi or Nyassa of Kilwa. According to Don Angelo Vinco,
who visited Loquéck in 1852, beyond the Cataract of Garbo&mdash;supposed
to be in N. lat. 2° 40'&mdash;at a distance of sixty miles lie
Robego, the capital of Kuenda and Lokoya (Logoja), of which the
latter receives an affluent from the east. Beyond Lokoya the White
Nile is described as a <i>small and rocky mountain river</i>, presenting
none of the features of a stream flowing from a broad expanse of
water like the great Nyanza reservoir.</p>

<p>"The periodical swelling of the Nyanza Lake, which, flooding a
considerable tract of land on the south, may be supposed&mdash;as it lies
flush with the basal surface of the country&mdash;to inundate extensively
all the low lands that form its periphery, forbids belief in the
possibility of its being the head-stream of the Nile, or the reservoir
of its periodical inundation. In Karágwah, upon the western shore,
the <i>masika</i>, or monsoon, last from October to May or June, after
which the dry season sets in. The Egyptian Expedition found the
river falling fast at the end of January, and they learned from the
people that it would rise again about the end of March, at which
season the sun is vertical over the equator. About the summer
solstice (June), when the rains cease in the regions south of and
upon the equator, the White Nile begins to flood. From March to
the autumnal equinox (September) it continues to overflow its banks
till it attains its magnitude, and from that time it shrinks through
the winter solstice (December) till March.</p>

<p>"The Nile is, therefore, full during the dry season and low during
the rainy season, south of and immediately upon the equator. And
as the northern counterslope of Kenia will, to a certain extent, be
a lee-land like Ugogi, it cannot have the superfluity of moisture
necessary to send forth a first-class stream. The inundation is
synchronous with the great falls of the northern equatorial regions,
which extend from July to September, and is dependent solely
upon the tropical rains. It is therefore probable that the true
sources of the 'Holy River' will be found to be a network of
runnels and rivulets of scanty dimensions, filled by monsoon torrents,
and perhaps a little swollen by melted snow on the northern water-parting
of the eastern Lunar Mountains.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Our Return.</span></h4>


<p>"At Kázeh, to my great disappointment, it was settled, in a full
Arab conclave, that we must return to the coast by the path with
which we were painfully familiar. It was only the state of our
finances which prevented us, whilst at Ujiji, from navigating the
Tanganyika southwards and arriving, after a journey of three months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
at Kilwa. That and 'leave' prevented us from going to Karágwah
and Uganda. The rains, which rendered travelling impossible, set
in about September; our two years' leave of absence were drawing
to a close, and we were afraid to risk it, but we meant to return
and do these things, tracing the course of the Rufiji river (Rwaha)
and visiting the coast between the Usagára Mountains and Kilwa, an
unknown line.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Kindness_of_Musa_Mzuri_and_Snay_bin_Amir"></a>The Kindness of Musa Mzuri and Snay bin Amir.</i></div>

<p>"Musa Mzuri returned with great pomp to Kázeh; he is
between forty-five and fifty, tall, gaunt, with delicate extremities,
and the regular handsome features of a high-caste Indian Moslem.
He is sad and staid, wears a snowy skull-cap, and well-fitting sandals.
His abode is a village in size, with lofty gates, spacious courts, full
of slaves and hangers-on, a great contrast to the humility of the
Semite tenements. His son knew a little English, but he had
learnt no Hindostani from his father, who, though expatriated for
thirty-five years, spoke his mother tongue purely and well. Musa
was a man of quiet, unaffected manner, dashed with a little Indian
reserve. One Salim bin Rashid, while collecting ivory to the eastward
of the Nyanza Lake, had recovered a Msawahili porter, who,
having fallen sick on the road, had been left by a Caravan amongst
the wildest of the East African tribes, the Wahuma (the Wamasai).
From this man, who spent two years amongst these plunderers
and their rivals in villany, the Warudi, I gained most valuable
information. I also was called upon by Amayr bin Said el Shaksi,
a strong-framed, stout-hearted Arab, who, when his vessel foundered
in the Tanganyika, swam for his life, and lived for five months on
roots and grasses, until restored to Ujiji by an Arab canoe. He spent
many hours a day with me&mdash;he gave me immense information; and
Hilal bin Nasur, a well-born Harisi returned from K'hokoro, also
gave me most valuable facts.</p>

<p>"It is needless to say that, with all our economy and care, we
arrived at the coast destitute. The hospitable Snay bin Amir came
personally, although only a convalescent, to superintend our departure,
provided us with his own slaves and a charming Arab
breakfast; he spent the whole of that day with us, and followed us
out of the compound through a white-hot sun and a chilling wind;
nay, he did more&mdash;he followed us to our next station with Musa,
and he helped us to put the finishing touches to the journals. I
thanked these kind-hearted men for their many good deeds and
services, and promised to report to H.H. the Sayyid Majid the
hospitable reception of his subjects generally, and of Snay and
Musa in particular. In the evening we took a most affecting farewell.<a name="FNanchor_6_105" id="FNanchor_6_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_105" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
On the 4th of October, insufficiency of porterage compelled
me to send back men for articles left by them at several of the
villages, and we at last reached Hanga, our former quarters.
Desertions were rife, and so were quarrels, in which I was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
begged to take an active part, but experience amongst the Bashi-Bazouks
in the Dardanelles taught me better.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Little Irons.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Spekes_Illness"></a>Speke's Illness.</i></div>

<p>"At Hanga, Jack had been chilled on the march from the cruel
easterly wind, and at the second march he had ague. At Hanga
we were lodged in a foul cowhouse full of vermin, and exposed to
the fury of the gales. He had a deaf ear, an inflamed eye, and a
swollen face, but worst of all was a mysterious pain, which shifted&mdash;he
could not say whether it was liver or spleen. It began with a
burning sensation as by a branding iron above the right breast, and
then extended to the heart with sharp twinges. It then ranged
round the spleen, attacked the upper part of the right lung, and
finally settled in the liver.</p>

<p>"On the 10th of October, at dawn, he woke with a horrible dream
of tigers, leopards, and other beasts, harnessed with a network of
iron hooks, dragging him, like the rush of a whirlwind, over the
ground. He sat up on the side of his bed, forcibly clasping both
sides with his hands. Half stupefied by pain, he called to Bombay,
who had formerly suffered from this <i>kichyomachyoma</i>, 'the little
irons,' who put him in the position a man must lie in, who gets this
attack. The next spasm was less severe, but he began to wander.
In twenty-four hours, supported by two men, he staggered towards
the tent to a chair; but the spasms returning, he was assisted back
into the house, where he had a third fit of epileptic description, like
hydrophobia. Again he was haunted by crowds of devils, giants,
lion-headed demons, who were wrenching with superhuman force,
and stripping the sinews and tendons of his legs down to his ankles.
With limbs racked by cramps, features drawn and ghastly, frame
fixed and rigid, eyes glazed and glassy, he began to bark with a
peculiar chopping motion of the mouth and tongue, with lips protruding,
the effect of difficulty of breathing, which so altered his
appearance that he was not recognizable, and terrified all beholders.
When the third and severest spasm had passed away, and he could
speak, he called for pen and paper, and wrote an incoherent letter
of farewell to his family. That was the crisis. I never left him, taking
all possible precautions, never letting him move without my assistance,
and always having a resting-place prepared for him; but for
some weeks he had to sleep in a half sitting-up position, pillow-propped,
and he could not lie upon his side. Although the pains
were mitigated, they did not entirely cease; this he expressed by
saying, 'Dick, the knives are sheathed!'</p>

<p>"During Jack's delirium he let out all his little grievances of fancied
wrongs, of which I had not had even the remotest idea. He was
vexed that his diary (which I had edited so carefully, and put into
the Appendix of 'First Footsteps in Eastern Africa') had not been
printed <i>as</i> he wrote it&mdash;geographical blunders and all; also because
he had not been paid for it, I having lost money over the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
myself. He asked me to send his collections to the Calcutta
Museum of Natural History; now he was hurt because I had done
so. He was awfully grieved because in the thick of the fight at
Berberah, three years before, I had said to him, 'Don't step back,
or they will think we are running.' I cannot tell how many more
things I had unconsciously done, and I crowned it by not accepting
immediately his loud assertion <i>that he had discovered the Sources
of the Nile</i>; and I never should have known that he was pondering
these things in his heart, if he had not raved them out in delirium.
I only noticed that his alacrity had vanished; that he was never
contented with any arrangement; that he left all the management to
me, and that then he complained that he had never been consulted;
that he quarrelled with our followers, and got himself insulted; and,
previously to our journey, having been unaccustomed to sickness, he
neither could endure it himself, nor feel for it in others. He took
pleasure in saying unkind, unpleasant things, and said he could not
take an interest in any exploration if he did not command it.</p>

<p>"These illnesses are the effects of fever, and a mysterious manifestation
of miasma in certain latitudes; for in some tracts we were
perfectly well, in other tracts we were mortally sick, and the changes
were instantaneous. Cultivation and Civilization will probably wear
these effects out, by planting, clearing jungle, and so on.</p>

<p>"I immediately sent an express back to Snay bin Amir, for the
proper treatment, and found that they powdered myrrh with yolk of
egg and flour of <i>mung</i> for poultices. I saw that, in default of physic,
change of air was the only thing for him, and I had a hammock
rigged up for him, and by good fortune an unloaded Caravan was
passing down to the coast. We got hold of thirteen unloaded
porters, who for a large sum consented to carry us to Rubuga, else
we should have been left to die in the wilderness. Bombay had
long since returned to his former attitude, that of a respectful and
most ready servant. He had on one trip broken my elephant gun,
killed my riding-ass, and lost his bridle, and did all sorts of irrational
things, but for all that he was a most valuable servant, for his
unwearied activity, his undeviating honesty, and his kindness of
heart. Said bin Salim had long forfeited my confidence by his
carelessness and extravagance, and the disappearance of the outfit
committed to him at Ujiji&mdash;in favour of one of his friends, as I afterwards
learned&mdash;rendered him unfit for stewardship. The others
praised each other openly and without reserve, and if an evil tale
ever reached my ear, it was against innocent Bombay, its object
being to ruin him in my estimation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="They_cross_the_Fiery_Field"></a>They cross the "Fiery Field."</i></div>

<p>As I knew we should be short of water, I prepared by packing
a box with empty bottles, which we could fill at the best
springs, and by the result of that after-wisdom which some have
termed 'fool's wit,' I commenced the down march happy as a
<i>bourgeois</i> or a trapper in the Pays Sauvage. Before entering
the 'Fiery Field' the hammock-bearers became so exorbitant
that I drew on my jackboots and mounted an ass, and Jack
had so far convalesced that he wanted to ride too. He had still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
however, harassing heartache, nausea, and other bilious symptoms,
when exposed to the burning sun; but when he got to K'hok'ho in
Ugogi, sleep and appetite came, he could carry a heavy rifle, and
do damage amongst the antelope and guineafowl. Now all began
to wax civil, even to servility, grumbling ceased, smiles mantled
every countenance, and even the most troublesome rascal was to be
seen meekly sweeping out our tents with a bunch of thorns. We
made seven marches between Hanga and Tura, where we arrived
on the 28th of October, and halted six days to procure food. My
own party were 10; Said bin Salim's, 12; the Beloch, 38; Ramji's
party, 24; the porters, 68&mdash;in all 152 souls. We plunged manfully
into the 'Fiery Field,' and after seven marches in seven days, we
bivouacked at Jiwe la Mkoa, and on the 12th of November, after
two days' march, came into the fertile red plain of Mdaduru, in the
transit of Ugogi. After that, where I had been taught to expect
danger, it reduced itself to large disappearances of cloth and beads.
Gul Mahommed was our Missionary, but he was just like the
European old lady, who believes that on such subjects all the world
must think with her. I have long been suspected of telling lies,
when describing the worship of a god with four arms, and the
goddesses with two heads. The transit of Ugogi occupied three
weeks. At Kanyenye we were joined by a large down-Caravan of
Wanyamwezi, who, amongst other news, told us that our former line
through Usagára was closed through the fighting of the tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="An_Official_Wigging"></a>An Official Wigging.</i></div>

<p>"On the 6th of December we arrived at our old ground in
the Ugogi Dhun, and met another Caravan, which presently drew
forth a packet of letters and papers. This post brought me
rather an amusing official wigging. Firstly, there was a note from
Captain Rigby, my friend Hamerton's successor at Zanzibar.
Secondly, the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'3, Savile Row.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Dear Burton,</span></p>

<p>"'Go ahead! Vogel and MacGuire dead&mdash;murdered. Write
often.</p>

<p>"'Yours truly,</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Norton Shaw.</span>'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The 'wig' was this. I had paid the Government the compliment
of sending it, through the Royal Geographical Society, an account of
political affairs in the Red Sea, saying I feared trouble at Jeddah,
which I had had from my usual private information from the
interior, being fearful that there would be troubles at Jeddah; and
the only thanks I got was a letter, stating 'that my want of
discretion and due regard for the authorities to whom I am subordinate,
has been regarded with displeasure by the Government.'
They are cold and crusty to reward a little word of wisdom from their
babes and sucklings; but what was so comically sad was this:&mdash;The
official wig was dated the 1st of July, 1857. Posts are slow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Africa, so that by the same post I got a newspaper with an account
of the massacre of nearly all the Christians at Jeddah on the Red
Sea, expressing great fears that the Arab population of Suez also
might be excited to commit similar outrages. This took place on the
30th of June, 1858, exactly eleven months after I had warned the
Government.</p>

<p>"We loaded on the 7th of December, and commenced the
passage of the Usagára Mountains by the Kiringawána line. This
is the southern route, separated from the northern by an interval
of forty-three miles. It contains settlements like Maroro and
Kisanga. It is nineteen short stages; provisions are procurable,
water plentiful, and plenty of grass, as long as you can pass the
Warori tribe. Mosquitoes are plentiful. The owners of the land
have a chronic horror of the Warori, and on sighting our peaceful
Caravan they raised the war-cry, and were only quieted on knowing
that we were much more frightened than they were. We had wild
weather, we stayed at Maroro for food; at Kiperepeta there were
gangs of four hundred touters, with their muskets, waiting the
arrival of Caravans.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Christmas_Day"></a>Christmas Day,</i> 1858.</div>

<p>"On Christmas Day, 1858, at dawn, we toiled along the Kikoboga
river, which we forded four times. Jack and I had a fat capon
instead of roast beef, and a mess of ground nuts sweetened with
sugar-cane, which did duty for plum-pudding. The contrast of
what was, with what might be, now however suggested pleasurable
sensations. We might now see Christmas Day of 1859, whereas on
Christmas Day, 1857, we saw no chance of that of 1858. Fourteen
marches took us from the foot of Usagára Mountains to Central
Zungomero, traversing the districts of Eastern Mbwiga, Marundwe,
and Kirengwe. It is a road hideous and grotesque: no animals,
flocks, or poultry; the villages look like birds' nests torn from the
trees; the people slink away&mdash;they are all armed with bows and
poisoned arrows. At Zungomero, the village on the left bank of the
Mgeta, which we had occupied on the outer march, was razed to the
ground. I here offered a liberal reward to get to Kilwa. However,
I did not succeed, and there was some intrigue about the pay afterwards,
which I never understood, which was annoying to me; but
such events are common on the slave-paths in Eastern Africa. Of
the seven gangs of porters engaged on this journey, <i>only one</i>, an
unusually small portion, <i>left me without being fully satisfied</i>, and <i>that
one fully deserved to be disappointed</i>.</p>

<p>"On the 14th of January, 1859, we received Mr. Apothecary Frost's
letters, drugs, and medical comforts, for which we had written to
him July, 1857. After crossing the Mgeta, we sat down patiently
on a bank, in spite of the ants, to await the arrival of a Caravan to
complete our gang, but the new medical comforts enabled us to
have ether-sherbet and ether-lemonade, and it did not hurt us.
On the 17th of January a Caravan came, which I had been longing
to meet. The Arab Chiefs Sulayman bin Rashid el Riami and
Mohammed bin Gharib, who called upon me without delay, gave me
most interesting information. To the south, from Uhehe to Ubena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
was a continuous chain of highlands pouring affluents across the
road into the Rwaha river, and water was only procurable in the
beds of the nullahs and <i>fiumaras</i>. If this chain be of any considerable
length, it may represent the water-parting between the
Tanganyika and Nyassa Lakes, and thus divide by another and a
southerly lateral band the great Depression of Central Africa.</p>

<p>"The 21st of January we left Zungomero, and made Konduchi on
the 3rd of February in twelve marches. The mud was almost
throat-deep near Dut'humi, and we had a weary trudge of thick
slabby mire up to the knees. In places, after toiling under a sickly
sun, we crept under the tunnels of thick jungle-growth veiling the
streams, the dank fœtid cold of which caused a deadly sensation of
faintness, which was only relieved by a glass of ether-sherbet or a
pipe of the strongest tobacco. By degrees it was found necessary
to abandon the greater part of the remaining outfit and luggage.
The 27th of January saw us pass safely by the village where M.
Maizan was murdered.</p>

<p>"On the 28th there was a report that we were to be attacked at a
certain place, and Said bin Salim came to tell me that the road was
cut off, and that I must delay till an escort could be summoned
from the coast. I knew quite well that it was only an intrigue, but
I feared that real obstacles might be placed in our way by the wily
little man, and as soon as <i>bakshish</i> was mentioned, four naked
varlets appeared in a quarter of an hour as escort.</p>

<p>"On the 30th of January the men screamed with delight at the
sight of the mango tree, and all their old familiar fruits.</p>

<p>"On the 2nd of February, 1859, Jack and I caught sight of the sea.
We lifted our caps, and gave 'three times three and one more.' The
3rd of February saw us passing through the poles decorated with
skulls&mdash;a sort of negro Temple Bar&mdash;at the entrance of Konduchi;
they now grin in the London Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>"Our entrance was immense. The war-men danced, shot, shouted;
the boys crowded; the women lulliloo'd with all their might; and a
general procession conducted us to the hut, swept, cleaned, and
garnished for us, by the principal <i>Banyan</i> of the Head-quarter village,
and there the crowd stared and laughed until they could stare and
laugh no more. A boat transferred most of our following to their
homes, and they kissed my hand and departed, weeping bitterly
with the agony of parting. I sent a note to the Consul at Zanzibar,
asking for a coasting craft to explore the Delta and the unknown
course of the Rufiji river. I liberally rewarded Zawáda, who had
attended to Jack in his illness. We were detained at Konduchi for
six days, from the 3rd to the 10th of February.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Speke_leaves_Richard_Ill_but_apparently_Friendly"></a>Speke leaves Richard Ill, but apparently Friendly.</i></div>

<p>"On the 9th of February the craft arrived at Konduchi from
Zanzibar, and we rolled down the coast with a fair, fresh breeze
towards Kilwa, the Quiloa of De Gama and of Camoens. We lost
all our crew by cholera, and we were unable to visit the course of
the great Rufiji river, a counterpart of the Zambesi in the south,
and a water-road which appears destined to become the highway of
nations into Eastern Equatorial Africa. The deluge of rain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
floods showed me that the travelling season was at an end. I turned
the head of the craft northwards, and on the 4th of March, 1859,
we landed once more on the island of Zanzibar. Sick and wayworn,
I entered the house in sad memory of my old friend, which I was
fated to regret still more. The excitement of travel was succeeded
by an utter depression of mind and body; even the labour of
talking was too great. The little State was in the height of confusion,
in a state of Civil war; the eldest brother of the Sultan was preparing
a hostile visit to his youngest brother, the Sultan Sayyid Majid of
Zanzibar. After a fortnight of excitement and suspense, a gunboat
was sent to the elder brother to persuade him to return. His Highness
Sayyid Majid had honoured me with an expression of his
desire that I should remain until the expected hostilities might be
brought to a close. I did so willingly, in gratitude to a Prince to
whose good will my success was mainly indebted, but the Consulate
was no longer bearable to me. I was too conversant with local
politics, too well aware of what was going on, to be a pleasant companion
to its new tenant. I was unwilling to go, because so much
remained to be done. I wanted to wait for fresh leave of absence
and additional funds, but the evident anxiety of Consul Rigby to
get rid of me, and Jack's nervous impatience to go on, made me
abandon my intentions. Said bin Salim called often at the Consulate,
but Captain Rigby agreed with me that he had been more
than sufficiently rewarded, and the same with the others. Jack also
was of the same opinion, but it suited Jack, with his secret prospects
or intentions of returning without me, to change his mind afterwards,
and he was evidently able to get Captain Rigby to do the same.
There can be little doubt that Jack's intention of returning on the
second Expedition, on the lines of the one which he had done so
much to spoil, had a great deal to do with his action on this
occasion. When H.M.S. <i>Furious</i>, carrying Lord Elgin and Mr.
Laurence Oliphant, his secretary, arrived at Aden, passage was
offered to both of us. I could not start, being too ill. But <i>he</i>
went, and the words Jack said to me, and I to him, were as
follows:&mdash;'I shall hurry up, Jack, as soon as I can,' and the last
words Jack ever spoke to me on earth were, '<i>Good-bye, old fellow;
you may be quite sure I shall not go up to the Royal Geographical
Society until you come to the fore and we appear together. Make your
mind quite easy about that.</i>'</p>

<p>"With grateful heart I bid adieu to the Sultan, whose kindness and
personal courtesy will long dwell in my memory, and who expressed
a hope to see me again, and offered me one of his ships of war to
take me home. However, a clipper-built barque, the <i>Dragon of
Salem</i>, Captain Macfarlane, was about to sail with the south-west
monsoon for Aden. Captain Rigby did not accompany us on board,
a mark of civility usual in the East, but Bombay's honest face turned
up and seemed peculiarly attractive.</p>

<p>"On the 22nd of March, 1859, the clove shrubs and coco trees of
Zanzibar faded from my eyes, and after crossing and recrossing
three times the tedious Line, we found ourselves anchored, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
16th of April, near the ill-omened black walls of the Aden crater.
The crisis of my African sufferings had taken place at the Tanganyika;
the fever, however, still clung to me.</p>

<p>"I left the Aden coal-hole of the East on the 20th of April, 1859,
and in due time greeted with becoming heartiness my native shores.</p>

<p>"The very day after he returned to England, May 9th, 1859, Jack
called at the Royal Geographical Society and set on foot the scheme
of a new exploration. He lectured in Burlington House, and when
I reached London on May 21st I found the ground completely cut
from under my feet. Sir Roderick Murchison had given Jack the
leadership of a new Expedition; my own long-cherished plan of
entering Africa through Somali-land, landing at the Arab town
Mombas, was dismissed as unworthy of notice. Jack published
two articles in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, assumed the whole credit to
himself, illustrated a wonderful account of his own adventures and
discoveries, with a chart where invention is not in it. He said he
did all the astronomical work, and had taught me the geography of
the country through which we travelled, which made me laugh.
Jack, who literally owed everything to me, habitually wrote and
spoke of me to mutual friends in a most disagreeable manner.
Many people who professed to be friendly to me said it would be
more dignified to say nothing, but I knew how unwise it is to let
public sentence pass by default, and how delay may cause everlasting
evil, so I wrote the most temperate vindication of my position."<a name="FNanchor_7_106" id="FNanchor_7_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_106" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_102" id="Footnote_3_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_102"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "The following extract from the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical
Society</i>, May 9, 1859, will best illustrate what I mean:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"'Mr. Macqueen, F.R.G.S., said the question of the sources of the Nile had
cost him much trouble and research, and he was sure there was no material error
either in longitude or latitude in the position he had ascribed to them, namely, a
little to the eastward of the meridian of 35° and a little northward of the equator.
That was the principal source of the White Nile. The mountains there were
exceedingly high, from the equator north to Kaffa Enarea. All the authorities,
from east, west, north, or south, now perfectly competent to form judgments upon
such a matter, agreed with him; and among them were the officers commanding
the Egyptian Commission. It was impossible they could <i>all</i> be mistaken.
Dr. Krapf had been within a very short distance of it; he was more than a
hundred and eighty miles from Mombas, and he saw snow upon the mountains.
He conversed with the people who came from them, and who told him of the
snow and exceeding coldness of the temperature. The line of perpetual congelation,
it is well known, was seventeen thousand feet above the sea. He had an
account of the navigation of the White Nile by the Egyptian Expedition. It was
then given as 30° 30' N. lat. and 31° E. long. At this point the expedition
turned back for want of a sufficient depth of water. Here the river was 1370 feet
broad, and the velocity of the current <i>one quarter</i> of a mile per hour. The
journals also gave a specific and daily current, the depth and width of the river,
and everything, indeed, connected with it. Surely, looking at the current of the
river, the height of the Cartoom above the level of the sea, and the distance
thence up to the equator, the sources of the Nile must be six or eight thousand
feet above the level of the sea, and still much below the line of snow, which was
six or eight thousand feet farther above them. He deeply regretted he was
unable to complete the diagram for the rest of the papers he had given to the
Society, for it was more important than any others he had previously given. It
contained the journey over Africa from sea to sea, second only to Dr. Livingstone.
But all the rivers coming down from the mountains in question, and running south-eastward,
had been clearly stated by Dr. Krapf, who gave every particular concerning
them. He should like to know what the natives had said was to the
northward of the large lake. Did they say the rivers ran out from or into the
lake? How could the Egyptian officers be mistaken?
</p>
<p>
"'Captain Speke replied. They were not mistaken; and if they had pursued
their journey fifty miles further, they would undoubtedly have found themselves
at the northern borders of this lake.
</p>
<p>
"'Mr. Macqueen said that other travellers&mdash;Don Angelo, for instance&mdash;had
been within one and a half degrees of the equator, and saw the mountain of
Kimborat under the Line, and persisted in the statement, adding that travellers
had been up the river till they found it a mere brook. He felt convinced that the
large lake alluded to by Captain Speke was not the source of the Nile; it was
impossible it could be so, for it was not at a sufficiently high altitude.
</p>
<p>
"'The paper presented to the Society, when fully read in conjunction with the
map, will clearly show that the Bahr-el-Abiad had no connection with Kilimanjaro,
that it has no connection whatever with any lake or river to the south of the
equator, and that the swelling of the river Nile proceeds from the tropical rains of
the northern torrid zone, as was stated emphatically to Julius Cæsar by the Chief
Egyptian Priest, Amoreis, two thousand years ago.
</p>
<p>
"'In nearly 3° N. lat. there is a great cataract, which boats cannot pass. It is
called Gherba. About halfway (fifty miles) above, and between this cataract and
Robego, the capital of Kuenda, the river becomes so narrow as to be crossed by
a bridge formed by a tree thrown across it. Above Gherba no stream joins the
river either from the south or south-west.'"</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_103" id="Footnote_4_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_103"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> "When Jack returned to Kázeh, he represented Ukerewe and Mazita to be
islands, and although in sight of them, he had heard nothing concerning their
connection with the coast. This error was corrected by Salim bin Rashid, and
accepted by us. Yet I read in his 'Discovery of the Supposed Sources of the Nile:'
'Mansur, and a native, the greatest traveller of the place, kindly accompanied
and gave me every obtainable information. This man had traversed the island,
as he called it, of Ukerewe from north to south. But <i>by his rough mode of
describing it, I am rather inclined to think that instead of its being an actual
island, it is a connected tongue of land, stretching southwards from a promontory
lying at right angles to the eastern shore of the lake,</i> which being a wash, affords
a passage to the mainland during the fine season, but during the wet becomes
submerged, and thus makes Ukerewe temporarily an island.' The information,
I repeat, was given, not by the 'native,' but by Salim bin Rashid. When,
however, the latter proceeded to correct Jack's confusion between the well-known
coffee mart Kitara, and 'the island of Kitiri occupied by a tribe called Watiri,'
he gave only offence, consequently Kitiri has obtained a local habitation in <i>Blackwood</i>

<p>Just as I was getting into despair, and thinking whether I should
go and be a Sister of Charity (May, 1859), as the appearance of
Speke alone in London was giving me the keenest anxiety, and as
I heard that Richard was staying on in Zanzibar, in the hopes of
being allowed to return into Africa, I was very sore.<a name="FNanchor_1_107" id="FNanchor_1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_107" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 22nd, 1859, I chanced to call upon a friend. I was told
she was gone out, but would be in to tea, and was asked if I would
wait. I said, "Yes;" and in about five minutes another ring came
to the door, and another visitor was also asked to wait. The door
was opened, and I turned round, expecting to see my friend. Judge
of my feelings when I beheld Richard. For an instant we both
stood dazed, and I cannot attempt to describe the joy that followed.
He had landed the day before, and came to London, and now he
had come to call on this friend to know where I was living, where
to find me. No one will wonder if I say that we forgot all about
her and tea, and that we went downstairs and got into a cab, and
took a long drive.</p>

<p>I felt like one stunned; I only knew that he put me in and told
the cabman to drive. I felt like a person coming to after a fainting
fit or in a dream. It was acute pain, and for the first half-hour I
found no relief. I would have given worlds for tears or breath;
neither came, but it was absolute content, which I fancy people must
feel the first few moments after the soul is quit of the body. The first
thing that happened was, that we mutually drew each other's pictures
out from our respective pockets at the same moment, which, as we
had not expected to meet, showed how carefully they had been
kept.</p>

<p>After that, we met constantly, and he called upon my parents. I
now put our marriage <i>seriously</i> before them, but without success as
regards my mother.</p>

<p>I shall never forget Richard as he was then; he had had twenty-one
attacks of fever, had been partially paralyzed and partially blind;
he was a mere skeleton, with brown yellow skin hanging in bags, his
eyes protruding, and his lips drawn away from his teeth. I used to
give him my arm about the Botanical Gardens for fresh air, and
sometimes convey him almost fainting to our house, or friends'
houses, who allowed and encouraged our meeting, in a cab.</p>

<p>The Government and the Royal Geographical Society looked
coldly on him; the Indian army brought him under the reduction;
he was almost penniless, and he had only a few friends to greet him.
Speke was the hero of the hour, the Stanley of 1859-1864. This
was <i>one</i> of the martyrdoms of that uncrowned King's life, and I think
but that for me he would have died.</p>

<p>He told me that all the time he had been away the greatest consolation
he had had was my fortnightly journals, in letter form, to
him, accompanied by all newspaper scraps and public and private
information, and accounts of books, such as I knew would interest
him, so that when he did get a mail, which was only in a huge batch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
now and then, he was as well posted up as if he were living in
London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_try_to_effect_a_Reconciliation_between_Speke_and_Richard"></a>We try to effect a Reconciliation between Speke and Richard.</i></div>

<p>He never abused Speke, as a mean man would have done; he
used to say, "Jack is one of the bravest fellows in the world; if
he has a fault it is overweening vanity, and being so easily flattered;
in good hands he would be the best of men. Let him alone; he
will be very sorry some day, though that won't mend my case." It
is interesting <i>now</i> to mark in their letters how they descend from
"Dear Jack," and "Dear Dick," to "Dear Burton," and "Dear
Speke," until they become "Sir!" But I must relate in Speke's
favour that the injury once done to his friend, and the glory won
for himself, he was not happy with it.</p>

<p>Speke and I had a mutual friend, a lady well known in Society
as Kitty Dormer (Countess Dormer)&mdash;she would be ninety-four
were she now living. She was one of the fashionable beauties of
George IV.'s time, and was engaged to my father when they were
young.</p>

<p>About a hundred years or more ago, a John Hanning Speke had
married one of the Arundells of Wardour, and Lord Arundell always
considered the Spekes as sort of neighbours and distant connections,
so through this lady's auspices, Speke and I met, and also
exchanged many messages; and we nearly succeeded in reconciling
Richard and Speke, and would have done so, but for the anti-influences
around him. He said to me, "I am so sorry, and I don't
know how it all came about. Dick was so kind to me; nursed me
like a woman, taught me such a lot, and I used to be so fond of
him; but it would be too difficult for me to go back now." <i>And
upon that last sentence he always remained and acted.</i></p>

<p>Richard was looking so lank and thin. He was sadly altered; his
youth, health, spirits, and beauty were all gone for the time. He
fully justified his fevers, his paralysis and blindness, and any amount
of anxiety, peril, hardship, and privation in unhealthy latitudes.
Never did I feel the strength of my love as then. He returned
poorer, and dispirited by official rows and every species of annoyance;
but he was still, had he been ever so unsuccessful, and had every
man's hand against him, my earthly god and king, and I could have
knelt at his feet and worshipped him. I used to feel so proud of
him; I used to like to sit and look at him, and to think, "You are
mine, and there is no man on earth the least like you."</p>

<p>At one time, when he was at his worst, I found the following in his
journal&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="My_Appeal_to_my_Mother"></a>My Appeal to my Mother.</i></div>

<p>I felt bitterly not having the privilege of staying with Richard and
nursing him, and he was very anxious that our marriage should take
place; so I wrote the following letter to my mother, who was still
violently opposing me, and who was absent on some visits:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"October, 1859.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Mother</span>,<a name="FNanchor_2_108" id="FNanchor_2_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_108" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"I feel quite grateful to you for inviting my confidence.
It is the first time you have ever done so, and the occasion shall
not be neglected. It will be a great comfort to me to tell you all;
but you must forgive me if I say that I have one tender place too
sore to be touched, and that an unkind or slighting word might
embitter all our future lives. I know it is impossible for you, with
your views for me, both spiritual and temporal, to understand, far
less sympathize with me on the present occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel nothing in common with the world I live in. I dreamt
of a Companion and a Life that would suit me exactly, and I them.
Like many other people, I suppose, I found my heart yearning,
and my tastes developing towards quite opposite things to those
which fall naturally in my way. I am rather ashamed to tell you
that I fell in love with Captain Burton at Boulogne, and would have
married him at any time between this and then, if he had asked me.
The moment I saw his brigand-daredevil look, I set him up as an
idol, and determined that he was the only man I would ever marry;
but he never knew it until three years ago, before he went to Africa.
From Boulogne he went to Mecca and Medina, and then to Harar,
and then to the Crimea, and on his return home, in 1856, you may
remember he came to see us, and I saw him again, and then he
fell in love with me and asked me to be his wife, and was perfectly
amazed to find that I had cared for him all that time. He was
then just going to start for Central Africa; he could not marry me,
he could not take me, but we promised to be true to each other,
and, as you well know, we met every day. When I came home
one day in an ecstasy and told you that I had found the Man and
the Life I longed for, that I clung to them with all my soul, and that
nothing would turn me, and that all other men were his inferiors,
what did you answer me? 'That he was the <i>only</i> man you would
never consent to my marrying; that you would rather see me in my
coffin.' Did you know that you were flying in the face of God? Did
you know it was my Destiny? Do you not realize that, because it is
not <i>your</i> ideal, you want to dash mine from me? He has been away
three years, and I have waited for him, feeling sure that in the end
you would relent. You have faith in the hand of God in these
matters! I called on a friend who was not at home. I was asked
to wait; five minutes after the bell rang again, and another visitor
was also asked to wait; the door opened, and Captain Burton and
I stood face to face. He had disembarked the night before, had
just arrived in town, and called there to know where I was living.
The year and eight months' silence, which had distressed me so
awfully, when you all said he had forgotten me, that he had been
eaten by jackals, that he never meant to return, had been spent
in the wildest part of the desert, where there was no means of
communication. He had had twenty-one fevers, temporary blindness,
and partial paralysis of the limbs; he has come back with flying
colours, but youth, health, good looks, and spirits temporarily broken
up from hardships, privations and dangers, and also many a scar.
It surprises me that you should consider mine an infatuation, you
who worship talent, and my father bravery and adventure, and here
they are both united. Look at his military services&mdash;India and
the Crimea! Look at his writings, his travels, his poetry, his
languages and dialects! Now Mezzofanti is dead he stands first
in Europe; he is the best horseman, swordsman, and pistol shot.
He has been presented with the gold medal, he is an F.R.G.S.,
and you must see in the newspapers of his glory, and fame, and
public thanks, where he is called 'the Crichton of the day,' 'one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
of the Paladins of the Age,' 'the most interesting figure of the
nineteenth century,' 'the man <i>par excellence</i> of brain and pluck.'
In his wonderful explorings, he goes where none but natives have
ever trod, in hourly peril of his life, often wounded, often without
food and water. One day he is a doctor, one day a priest, another
he keeps a stall in the bazar, sometimes he is a blacksmith. I could
tell you such adventures of him, and traits of determination, which
would delight you, were you unprejudiced. It makes me quite ill
to see little men boasting of the paltry things that they have done or
seen, after this man, who has never been known to speak of himself.
He is not at all the man, speaking of his private character, that
people take him to be, or what he sometimes, for fun, pretends to
be. There is no one whom you would more respect, or attach
yourself to, for he is lovable in every way; and what fascinates me
is, that every thought, word, or deed is that of a thorough gentleman.
I wish I could say the same for all our own acquaintances or relations.
There is not a particle of pettiness or snobbery in him;
he is far superior to any man I ever met; he has the brain, pluck,
and manliness of any hundred of those I have ever seen, united to
exceeding sensitiveness, gentleness, delicacy, generosity, and good
pride. He is the only being who awes me into respect, and to
whose command I bow my head; and any evil opinions you may
have ever heard of him, arise from his recklessly setting at defiance
conventional people, talking nonsense about religion and heart and
principle, which those who do not know him unfortunately take
seriously, and he amuses himself with watching their stupid faces.
Once he is married to me, he will be the favourite of our family, and
you will all be proud of him, and have implicit confidence in him.
And let me tell you another thing: you and my father are immensely
proud of your families, and we are taught to be the same; but from
the present to the future, I believe that our proudest record will be
our alliance with Richard Burton. I want to '<i>Live</i>.' I hate the
artificial existence of London; I hate the life of a vegetable in the
country; I want a wild, roving, vagabond life. I am young, strong,
and hardy, with good nerves; I like roughing it, and I always want
to do something daring and spirited; you will certainly repent it, if
you keep me tied up. I wonder that you do not see the magnitude
of the position offered to me. His immense talent and adventurous
life must command interest. A master-mind like his exercises power
and influence over all around him; but I love him because I find
in him so much depth of feeling, and a generous heart; because,
knowing him to be as brave as a lion, he is yet so gentle, of a
delicate, sensitive nature, and the soul of honour. I am fascinated
by his manners because they are easy, dignified, simple, and yet so
original; there is such a touching forgetfulness of himself and his
fame. He appears to me a something so unique and romantic. He
unites the wild and daring, with the true gentleman in every sense
of the word, and a stamp of a man of the world of the very best sort,
having seen things <i>without</i> the artificial atmosphere <i>we</i> live in, as
well as <i>within</i>. He has even the noble faults I love in a man, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
they can be so called. He is proud, fiery, satirical, ambitious; how
could I help looking up to him with fear and admiration? I worship
ambition. Fancy achieving a good which affects millions, making
your name a national one? It is infamous the way most men in the
world live and die, and are never missed, and, like us women, leave
nothing but a tombstone. By <i>ambition</i> I mean men who have the
will and power to change the face of things. I wish I were a man.
If I were, I would be Richard Burton; but, being only a woman,
I would be Richard Burton's wife. He has not mere brilliancy of
talent, but brains that are a rock of good sense, and stern decision
of character. I love him purely, passionately, and respectfully;
there is no void in my heart, it is at rest for ever with him. It is
part of my nature, part of myself, the basis of all my actions, part
of my religion; my whole soul is absorbed in it. I have given my
every feeling to him, and kept nothing back for myself or for the
world. I would this moment sacrifice and leave <i>all</i> to follow his
fortunes, even if you all cast me out&mdash;if the world tabooed me, and
no compensation <i>could</i> be given to me for <i>his</i> loss. Whatever the
world may condemn of lawless or strong opinions, whatever he is to
the world, he is perfect to me, and I would not have him otherwise
than he is.</p>

<p>"That is my side of the business, and now I will turn to your few
points. You have said that 'you do not know who he is, that you do
not meet him anywhere.' I don't like to hear you say the first,
because it makes you out illiterate, and you know how clever you
are; but as to your not meeting him, considering the particular sort
of society which you seek with a view to marrying your daughters, you
are not likely to meet him there, because it bores him, and it is quite
out of his line. In these matters he is like a noble, simple savage, and
has lived too much in the desert to comprehend the snobberies of our
little circles in London. He is a world-wide man, and his life and
talents open every door to him; he is a great man all over the East, in
literary circles in London, and in great parties where you and I would
be part of the crowd, he would be remarkable as a star, also amongst
scientific men and in the clubs. Most great houses are only too
glad to get him. The only two occasions in which he came out last
season it was because I begged him to, and he was bored to death.
In public life every one knows him. As to birth, he is just as good
as we are; all his people belong to good old families. The next
subject is religion. With regard to this he <i>appears</i> to disbelieve,
pretends to self-reliance, quizzes good, and fears no evil. He leads
a good life, has a natural worship of God, innate honour, and does
unknown good. <i>At present</i> he is following no form; at least, none
that he <i>owns</i> to. He says there is nothing between Agnosticism and
Catholicity. He wishes to be married in the Catholic Church, says
that I must practise my own religion, and that our children must be
Catholics, and will give such a promise in writing. I myself do not
care about people <i>calling</i> themselves Catholics, if they are not so
in actions, and Captain Burton's life is far more Christian, more
gentlemanly, more useful, and more pleasing to God&mdash;I am sure&mdash;than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
many who <i>call</i> themselves Catholics, and whom we know.
<i>No.</i> 3 point is money, and here I am before <i>you</i>, terribly crestfallen&mdash;- there
is nothing except his pay. As captain, that is, I believe,
£600 a year in India, and £300 in England. We want to try and get
the Consulship of Damascus, where we could have a life after both
our hearts, and where the vulgarity of poverty would not make itself
apparent. If you do not disinherit me, I shall settle my portion on
him, and after on any children we may have, in which case he would
insure his life. He may have expectations or not, but we can't rely
on them.</p>

<p>"Now, dearest mother, I think we should treat each other fairly.
Let him go to my father, and ask for me properly. Knowing you
as I do, your ideas and prejudices, I know that a man of different
religion and no means, would stand in a disagreeable position; so
does he, and I will <i>not</i> have him insulted. I don't ask you to
approve, nor to like it; I don't expect it. I do entreat your blessing,
and even a <i>passive</i>, reluctant consent to anything that I may do.
We shall never marry any one else, and never give each other up,
should we remain so all our lives. Do not accuse me of deception,
because I shall see him and write to him whenever I get a chance,
and if you drive me to it I shall marry him in defiance, because he is
by far my first object in life, and the day he (if ever) gives me up I
will go straight into a convent. If you think your Catholic friends
and relatives will blame you, shut your eyes, give me no wedding, no
trousseau, let me get married how I can; but when it is <i>done</i>, acknowledge
to yourself that I neither <i>could</i> nor <i>would</i> be dishonourable
enough to marry any other man, that God made no law against <i>poor</i>
people becoming attached to each other, that I am of an age when
you can only advise but not hinder me, that your leave once asked
my duty ends, that your life is three parts run, and mine is before me,
and that if I choose to live out of the 'World' that forms <i>your</i>
happiness, what is it to you? how does it hurt you? I have got to
live with him night and day, for all my life. The man you would
choose I should loathe. I see all the disadvantages, and am willing
to accept them with him. Why should you object? I do not ask
you to share it. You will see that I am so set on it, that the whole
creation is as nothing in comparison, that nothing will keep me from
it. Do not embitter my whole future life, for God's sake. I would
rather die a thousand times than go through again what I have borne
for the last five years. Do not quarrel with me, or keep me away
from you, and you shall not regret it. I shall have a wide field for a
useful, active life, if you do not crush me by an unhappy coldness.
When you take the 'World' into your confidence, remember that
the day will come when you will forgive and repent, and you will
feel quite hurt to find that the 'World' does <i>not</i> forgive, that it
remembers all you said when you were angry, and that you have
debarred your own children from many pleasant things in this life.
When we are parted there will be endless regrets. I will not allude
to other marriages that you <i>have</i> consented to, but you should rejoice
that I have got a man who knows how to protect me, and to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
care of me. Do think it all over in earnest, and if you love me as
you say you do&mdash;and I believe it well&mdash;do be generous and kind
about this. Parents hold so much power to bless or curse the future.
Which will you do for me? Let it be a blessing! I look upon him
as my future husband; I only wait a kind word from you, the
appointment, and Cardinal Wiseman's protection. Do write to me,
dearest mother, but write not with <i>your</i> views, but entering into <i>mine</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="My_Letter_to_my_Mother_Not_a_Success"></a>My Letter to my Mother&mdash;Not a Success.</i></div>

<p>The only answer to this letter was an awful long and solemn sermon,
telling me "that Richard was not a Christian, and had no money."
I do not defend my letter to my mother; I should not wish that girls
should say or think that this is the way to write to one's mother, nor
would mothers in general like to receive such a letter. I print it to
show what Richard's character was, and the impression that a girl
would receive of it, what views, and what feelings she was capable
of entertaining for him. I only plead that I was fighting for my
whole future life, and my natural destiny; that I had waited for five
years; and that I saw that I had to force my mother's hand, or lose
all that made life worth living for. Richard used to say that my
mother and I were both gifted with "the noble firmness of the
mule." Of course I can see <i>now</i> what an aggravating letter it must
have been to a woman whose heart was set on big matches for her
daughters.</p>

<p>Richard now brought out the "Lake Regions of Equatorial Africa"
(2 vols., 1860), and the Royal Geographical Society dedicated the
whole of Vol. XXXIII. to the same subject (Clowes and Sons, 1860).
My mother still remained obstinate, and Richard thought we should
have to take the law into our own hands. I could not bear the
thoughts of going against my mother.</p>

<p>One day in April, 1860, I was walking out with two friends, and
a tightening of the heart came over me that I had known before.
I went home and said to my sister, "I am not going to see Richard
for some time." She said, "Why, you will see him to-morrow."
"No, I shall not," I said; "I don't know what is the matter."
A tap came at the door, and a note with the well-known writing
was put into my hand. I knew my fate, and with deep-drawn
breath I opened it. He had left&mdash;could not bear the pain of saying
good-bye; would be absent for nine months, on a journey to see
Salt Lake City. He would then come back, and see whether I had
made up my mind to choose between him or my mother, to marry
me if I <i>would</i>; and if I had not the courage to risk it, he would go
back to India, and from thence to other explorations, and return no
more. I was to take nine months to think about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>I was for a long time in bed, and delirious. For six weeks I was
doctored for influenza, mumps, sore throat, fever, delirium, and
everything that I had not got, when in reality I was only heartsick,
struggling for what I wanted, a last hard struggle with the suspense
of my future before me, and nothing and nobody to help me. I
felt it would be my breaking up if circumstances continued adverse,
but I determined to struggle patiently, and suffer bravely to the end.</p>

<p>At this juncture, as I was going to marry a poor man, and also
to fit myself for Expeditions, I went, for change of air, to a farmhouse,
where I learnt every imaginable thing that I might possibly
want, so that if we had <i>no</i> servants, or if servants were sick or
mutinous, we should be perfectly independent.</p>

<p>On my return I saw the murder of a Captain Burton in the paper,
and <i>even</i> my mother pitied me, and took me to the mail office,
where a clerk, after numberless inquiries, gave us a paper. My life
seemed to hang on a thread till he answered, and then my face
beamed so that the poor man was quite startled. It <i>was</i> a Captain
Burton, murdered by his crew. I could scarcely feel sorry&mdash;how
selfish we are!&mdash;and yet he too, doubtless, had some one to love him.</p>

<p>Richard, meantime, had gone all over the United States, and
made a wonderful lot of friends; had gone to Salt Lake City to see
Brigham Young, where he stayed with the Mormons and their Prophet
for six weeks at great Salt Lake City, visiting California, where he
went all over the gold-diggings, and learnt practically to use both
pick and pan. He asked Brigham Young if he would admit him
as a Mormon, but Brigham Young shook his head, and said, "No,
Captain, I think you have done that sort of thing once before."
Richard laughed, and told him he was perfectly right.</p>

<p>About this time there was a meeting at the Royal Geographical
Society&mdash;November 13. I quote from the papers&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lord Ashburton (President) in the chair.&mdash;Captain J. Grantham,
R.E.; R. Lush, Q.C.; J. A. Lockwood, and H. Cartwright, Esqs.,
were elected Fellows.&mdash;The minutes of the former meeting having
been confirmed, the Chairman said that a letter would be read from
Captain Burton, by the Secretary. It would be a matter of pleasure
to all present to know that Captain Burton was in good health.
Dr. Shaw then read the following characteristic letter, which had
been addressed to him by that officer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Salt Lake City, Deserat, Utah Territory, September 7.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Shaw</span>,</p>

<p>"'You'll see my whereabouts by the envelope; I reached
this place about a week ago, and am living in the odour of sanctity,&mdash;a
pretty strong one it is too,&mdash;apostles, prophets, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
In about another week I expect to start for Carson Valley
and San Francisco. The road is full of Indians and other scoundrels,
but I've had my hair cropped so short that my scalp is not
worth having. I hope to be in San Francisco in October, and in
England somewhere in November next. Can you put my whereabouts
in some paper or other, and thus save me the bother of
writing to all my friends? Mind, I'm travelling for my health,
which has suffered in Africa, enjoying the pure air of the prairies,
and expecting to return in a state of renovation and perfectly ready
to leave a card on Muata Yanoo, or any other tyrant of that kind.</p>

<p>"'Meanwhile, ever yours,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">R. F. Burton</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The paper read was, 'Proposed Exploration in North-Western
Australia under Mr. F. Gregory.'&mdash;Mr. Galton read letters from
Captain Speke, in command of the East African Expedition, conveying
the gratifying intelligence that, through the kind assistance of
Sir George Grey, Governor at the Cape of Good Hope, the party had
been strengthened by the accession of a guard of twelve Hottentot
soldiers and £300. Admiral Keppel had conveyed the expedition
in her Majesty's steamer <i>Brisk</i> to Zanzibar.&mdash;A despatch from Sir
George Grey on Mr. Chapman's and Mr. Anderson's late journeys
in South Africa was read.&mdash;The President announced that subscriptions
would be received at the Royal Geographical Society, 15,
Whitehall Place, in aid of Consul Petherick's Expedition, to co-operate
with that under Captains Speke and Grant, <i>viâ</i> Khartoum
and the Upper Nile."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard travelled about twenty-five thousand miles, and then he
turned his head homewards. He wrote the "City of the Saints,"
1 vol., on the Mormons, and he brought it out in 1861. It was
reprinted by Messrs. Harper of New York, and extensively reviewed,
especially by the <i>Tour du Monde</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="News_of_Richard_and_Subsequent_Return"></a>News of Richard and Subsequent Return.</i></div>

<p>It was Christmas, 1860, that I went to stop with my relatives, Sir
Clifford and Lady Constable (his <i>first</i> wife, <i>née</i> Chichester), at
Burton Constable,&mdash;the father and mother of the present baronet.
There was a large party in the house, and we were singing; some
one propped up the music with the <i>Times</i> which had just arrived,
and the first announcement that caught my eye was that "Captain
R. F. Burton had arrived from America."</p>

<p>I was unable, except by great resolution, to continue what I was
doing. I soon retired to my room, and <i>sat</i> up all night, packing,
and conjecturing how I should get away,&mdash;all my numerous plans
tending to a "bolt" next morning,&mdash;should I get an affectionate
letter from him. I received two; one had been opened and read
by somebody else, and one, as it afterwards turned out, had been
burked at home before forwarding. It was not an easy matter. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
was in a large country-house in Yorkshire, with about twenty-five
friends and relatives, amongst whom was one brother, and I had
heaps of luggage. We were blocked up with snow and nine miles
from the station, and (<i>contra miglior noler voler mal pugna</i>) I had
heard of his arrival only early in the evening, and twelve hours
later I had managed to get a telegram ordering me to London,
under the impression that it was of the most vital importance.</p>

<p>What a triumph it is to a woman's heart, when she has patiently
and courageously worked, and prayed, and suffered, and the moment
is realized that was the goal of her ambition!</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as we met, and had had our talk, he said, "I have waited
for five years. The three first were inevitable
on account of my journey to Africa, but the
last two were not. Our lives are being spoiled
by the unjust prejudices of your mother, and it
is for you to consider whether you have not
already done your duty in sacrificing two of the
best years of your life out of respect to her.
If <i>once</i> you <i>really</i> let me go, mind, I shall never
come back, because I shall know that you have
not got the strength of character which <i>my</i> wife
must have. Now, you must make up your mind to choose between
your mother and me. If you choose me, we marry, and I stay; if
not, I go back to India and on other Explorations, and I return no
more. Is your answer ready?" I said, "Quite. I marry you this
day three weeks, let who will say nay."</p>

<p>When we fixed the date of our marriage, I wanted to be married
on Wednesday, the 23rd, because it was the Espousals of Our Lady
and St. Joseph, but he would not, because Wednesday, the 23rd,
and Friday, the 18th, were our unlucky days; so we were married
on the Vigil, Tuesday, the 22nd of January.</p>

<p>We pictured to ourselves much domestic happiness, with youth,
health, courage, and talent to win honour, name, and position. We
had the same tastes, and perfect confidence in each other. No one
turns away from real happiness without some very strong temptation
or delusion. I went straight to my father and mother, and told
them what had occurred. My father said, "I consent with all my
heart, if your mother consents," and my mother said, "<i>Never!</i>"
I said, "Very well, then, mother! I cannot sacrifice our two lives
to a mere whim, and you ought not to expect it, so I am going to
marry him, whether you will or no." I asked all my brothers and
sisters, and they said they would receive him with delight. My
mother offered me a marriage with my father and brothers present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
my mother and sisters not. I felt that that was a slight upon <i>him</i>,
a slight upon his family, and a slur upon me, which I did not
deserve, and I refused it. I went to Cardinal Wiseman, and I told
him the whole case as it stood, and he asked me if my mind was
absolutely made up, and I said, "<i>Absolutely</i>." Then he said,
"Leave the matter to me." He requested Richard to call upon
him, and asked him if he would give him three promises in writing&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That I should be allowed the free practice of my religion.</p>

<p>2. That if we had any children they should be brought up
Catholics.</p>

<p>3. That we should be married in the Catholic Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Family_Council_decides_the_Matter"></a>A Family Council decides the Matter.</i></div>

<p>Which three promises Richard readily signed. He also amused
the Cardinal, as the family afterwards learnt, by saying sharply,
"Practise her religion indeed! I should rather think she <i>shall</i>. A
man without a religion may be excused, but a woman without a
religion is not the woman for me." The Cardinal then sent for me,
promised me his protection, said he would himself procure a special
dispensation from Rome, and that he would perform the ceremony
himself. He then saw my father, who told him how bitter my
mother was about it; that she was threatened with paralysis; that we
had to consider her in every possible way, that she might receive no
shocks, no agitation, but that all the rest quite consented to the
marriage. A big family council was then held, and it was agreed
far better for Richard and me, and for every one, to make all proper
arrangements to be married, and to be attended by <i>friends</i>, and for
me to go away on a visit to some friends, that they might not come
to the wedding, nor participate in it, in order not to have a quarrel
with my mother; that they would break it to her at a suitable time,
and that the secret of their knowing it, should be kept up as long
as mother lived. "Mind," said my father, "you must never bring
a misunderstanding between mother and me, nor between her and
her children."</p>

<p>I passed that three weeks preparing very solemnly and earnestly
for my marriage day, but yet something differently to what many
expectant brides do. I made a very solemn religious preparation,
receiving the Sacraments. Gowns, presents, and wedding pageants
had no part in it, had no place. Richard arranged with my own
lawyer and my own priest that everything should be conducted in
a strictly legal and strictly religious way, and the whole programme
of the affair was prepared. A very solemn day to me was the eve of
my marriage. The following day I was supposed to be going to
pass a few weeks with a friend in the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Wedding"></a>Our Wedding.</i></div>

<p>At nine o'clock on Tuesday, the 22nd of January, 1861, my cab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
was at the door with my box on it. I had to go and wish my
father and mother good-bye before leaving. I went downstairs with
a beating heart, after I had knelt in my own room, and said
a fervent prayer that they might bless me, and if they did, I
would take it as a sign. I was so nervous, I could scarcely stand.
When I went in, mother kissed me and said, "Good-bye, child, God
bless you." I went to my father's bedside, and knelt down and said
good-bye. "God bless you, my darling," he said, and put his hand
out of the bed and laid it on my head. I was too much overcome
to speak, and one or two tears ran down my cheeks, and I remember
as I passed down I kissed the door outside.</p>

<p>I then ran downstairs and quickly got into my cab, and drove
to a friend's house (Dr. and Miss Bird, now of 49, Welbeck Street),
where I changed my clothes&mdash;not wedding clothes (clothes which
most brides of to-day would probably laugh at)&mdash;a fawn-coloured
dress, a black-lace cloak, and a white bonnet&mdash;and they and I drove
off to the Bavarian Catholic Church, Warwick Street, London.
When assembled we were altogether a party of eight. The Registrar
was there for legality, as is customary. Richard was waiting on the
doorstep for me, and as we went in he took holy water, and made
a very large sign of the Cross. The church doors were wide open,
and full of people, and many were there who knew us. As the 10.30
Mass was about to begin, we were called into the Sacristy, and we
then found that the Cardinal in the night had been seized with
an acute attack of the illness which carried him off four years later,
and had deputed Dr. Hearne, his Vicar-general, to be his proxy.</p>

<p>After the ceremony was over, and the names signed, we went back
to the house of our friend Dr. Bird and his sister Alice, who have
always been our best friends, where we had our wedding breakfast.</p>

</div>

<p>During the time we were breakfasting, Dr. Bird began to chaff
him about the things that were sometimes said of him, and which
were not true. "Now, Burton, tell me; how do you feel when
you have killed a man?" Dr. Bird (being a physician) had given
himself away without knowing it. Richard looked up quizzically,
and drawled out, "Oh, quite jolly! How do you?"</p>

</div>

<p>We then went to Richard's bachelor lodgings, where he had a
bedroom, dressing-room, and sitting-room, and we had very few
pounds to bless ourselves with, but were as happy as it is given
to any mortals out of heaven to be. The fact is that the only
clandestine thing about it, and that was quite contrary to <i>my</i> desire,
was that my poor mother, with her health and her religious scruples,
was kept in the dark, but I must thank God that, though paralysis
came on two years later, it was not I that caused it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/letter2.jpg" width="444" alt="letter verso" />
</div>

<p>I here insert the beautiful and characteristic letter which my
husband wrote to my father on the following day, in case he should
wish to give it to my mother. For the first few days of our marriage,
Richard used to be so worried at being stared at as a bridegroom,
that he always used to say that we had been married a couple of
years; but that sort of annoyance soon wore off, and then he became
rather proud of being a married man. To say that I was happy
would be to say nothing; a repose came over me that I had never
known. I felt that it was for Eternity, an immortal repose, and
I was in a bewilderment of wonder at the goodness of God, who
had almost worked miracles for me.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_are_received_at_Home_again"></a>We are received at Home again.</i></div>

<p>During this time my brothers visited us, keeping us up in all that
was going on. Some weeks later, two dear old aunts, Mrs. Strickland-Standish
and Monica, Lady Gerard, who lived at Portobello
House, Mortlake, nearly opposite to where I live now, and where I
had frequently passed several weeks every year (for they made a sort
of family focus), got to hear that I was seen going into a bachelor
lodging, and bowled up to London to tell my mother. She wrote
in an agony to my father, who was visiting in the country, "that a
dreadful misfortune had happened in the family; that I been seen
going into a bachelor lodging in London, and could not be at the
country house where I was supposed to be." My father telegraphed
back to her, "She is married to Dick Burton, and thank God for
it;" and he wrote to her, enclosing the letter just inserted, and
desired her to send one of my brothers for us, who knew where to
find us, and to mind and receive us properly. We were then sent
for home. My mother behaved like a true lady and a true Christian.
She kissed us both, and blessed us. I shall never forget how shy I
felt going home, but I went in very calmly, I kissed them all round,
and they received Richard in the nicest way, and then mother embarrassed
us very much by asking our pardon for flying in the face
of God, and opposing what she now knew to be His will. My
husband was very much touched. It was not long before she
approved of the marriage more than anybody, and as she grew to
know him, she loved him as much as her own sons. And this is
the way we came to be married.</p>

<p>In short, mother never could forgive herself, and was always
alluding to it either personally or by letter. It always was the same
burthen of song&mdash;"that she exposed me to such a risk, that my relations
might have abandoned me, that Society might not have received
me, that I might have been forbidden to put my name down for the
Drawing-room, when I had done nothing wrong;" and she said, "All
through <i>me</i>, and God had destined it, but I could not see it. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
thought you would have the courage to take the law in your own
hands;" and I used to answer her, "Mother, if you had all cast me
out, if Society had tabooed me, if I had been forbidden to go to
Court, it would not have kept me from it&mdash;I could not have helped
myself&mdash;I am quite content with my future crust and tent, and I
would not exchange places with the Queen; so do not harass
yourself."</p>

<p>However, by the goodness of God, and the justness and kindness
of a few great people, none of these catastrophes <i>did</i> happen.
We used to entreat of her not to say anything more about it, but
even on her deathbed she persisted in doing so. I shall never forget
that first night when we went home; I went up to my room and
changed my things, and ate my dinner humbly and silently. We
were a very large family and were all afraid to speak, and as
Richard was so very clever, the family stood rather in awe of him;
so there was a silence and restraint upon us; but the children were
allowed to come down to dessert for a treat, and, with the intuition
that children have, they knew that he wanted them, and that they
could do what they liked with him. One was a little <i>enfant
terrible</i>, and very fond of copying our midshipmen brothers' slang.
They crowded round my mother with their little doll-tumblers
waiting for some wine. He was so constrained that he forgot to
pass the wine at dessert as it came round to <i>him</i>, when a small voice
piped out from the end of the long table, "I say, old bottle-stopper&mdash;pass
the wine!" He burst out laughing, and that broke the
ice, and we all fell to laughing and talking. Mother punished the
child by giving him no wine, but Richard looked up and said so
sweetly, "Oh, <i>Mother</i>, not on my first night <i>at home!</i>" that her
heart went out to him.</p>

<p>We had seven months of uninterrupted bliss. Through the kindness
of Lord John Russell, Richard obtained the Consulship of Fernando
Po, in the Bight of Biafra, West Coast of Africa, with a coast
line of six or seven hundred miles for his jurisdiction, a deadly
climate, and £700 a year. He was too glad to get his foot on the
first rung of the ladder, so, though it was called the "Foreign Office
Grave," he cheerfully accepted it. It was not quite so cheerful for
me, because it was a climate of certain death to white women, and
he would not allow me to go out in an unlimited way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Delightful_London_Season"></a>A Delightful London Season.</i></div>

<p>We had a glorious season, and took up our position in Society.
He introduced me to all the people he knew, and I introduced him to
all the people that I knew. Lord Houghton (Monckton-Milnes), the
father of the present Lord Houghton, was very much attached to
Richard, and he settled the question of our position by asking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
friend Lord Palmerston to give a party, and to let me be the bride
of the evening; and when I arrived, Lord Palmerston gave me his
arm, and he introduced Richard and me to all the people we had
not previously known, and my relatives clustered around us as well.
I was allowed to put my name down for a Drawing-room. And
Lady Russell, now the Dowager, presented me at Court "on my
marriage."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Fire_at_Grindlays"></a>Fire at Grindlay's.</i></div>

<p>Shortly after this, happened Grindlay's fire, where we lost all we
possessed in the world, except the few boxes we had with us.
The worst was that all his books, and his own poetry, which was
beautiful, especially one poem, called "The Curse of Vishnu," and
priceless Persian and Arabic manuscripts, that he had picked up in
various out-of-the-way places, and a room full of costumes of every
nation, were burnt. He smiled, and said in a philosophical sort of
way, "Well, it is a great bore, but I dare say that the world will be
none the worse for some of those manuscripts having been burnt"
(a prophetic speech, as I now think of it). When he went down to
ask for some compensation, he found that Grindlay was insured, but
that he was not&mdash;not, he said, that any money could repay him for
the loss of the things. As he always saw the comic side of a tragedy
as well as the pathetic, "the funniest thing was the clerk asking me
if I had lost any plate or jewellery, and on my saying, 'No,' the change
in his face from sympathy to the utter surprise that I could care so
much for any other kind of loss, was amusing."</p>

<p>In 1861, when the Indian army changed hands, Richard suffered,
and, as Mr. Hitchman remarked, "his enemies may be congratulated
upon their mingled malice and meanness." He just gave the official
animus a chance. It was a common thing in times of peace for
Indian officers to be allowed to take appointments and remain on the
<i>cadre</i> of their regiment, temporarily or otherwise. Richard, in remonstrance,
would not quote names for fear of injuring other men, but
any man who knew Egypt could score off half a dozen. His knowledge
of the East, and of so many Eastern languages, would have
been of incalculable service in Egypt, upon the Red Sea, in
Marocco, Persia, in any parts of the East, and yet he, who in any
other land would have been rewarded with at least a K.C.B. and
a handsome pension, was glad to get his foot on the lowest rung
of the ladder of the Consular service, called the "Foreign Office
Grave," the Consulate of Fernando Po, and we could not think
enough of, talk enough of, or be grateful enough to Lord John
Russell, who gave it him; yet the acceptance of this miserable post
was made an excuse to strike his name off the Indian army list, and
the rule, which had been allowed to lapse in a score of cases, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
revived for Richard's injury under circumstances of discourtesy so
great, that it would be hard to believe the affront unintentional.
He received no notice whatever, and he only realized, on seeing his
successor gazetted, that his military career was actually ended, and
his past life become like a blank sheet of paper. It would have
been stretching no point to have granted this appointment, and to
have been retained in the army on half-pay, but it was refused; they
swept out his whole nineteen years' service as if they had never
been, without a vestige of pay or pension.</p>

<p>All his services in Sind had been forgotten, all his Explorations
were wiped out, and at the age of forty he found himself at home,
with the rank of Captain, no pay, no pension, plenty of fame, a newly
married wife, and a small Consulate in the most pestilential climate,
with £700 a year. In vain he asked to go to Fernando Po
<i>temporarily</i> till wanted for active service. He wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will be an act of injustice on the part of the Bombay Government
to solicit my removal on account of my having risked health
and life in my country's service.</p>

<p>"They are about to treat me as a man who has been idling
away my time and shirking duty; whereas I can show that every
hour has been employed for my country's benefit, in study, writings,
languages, and explorations. Are my wounds and fevers, and
perpetual risk of health and life, not to speak of personal losses,
to go for nothing?</p>

<p>"The Bombay Government does not take into consideration one
iota of my service, but casts the whole into oblivion. I consider
the Bombay Government to be unjustly prejudiced against me on
account of the <i>private piques</i> of a certain half-dozen individuals.
Will the Bombay Government put all its charges against me in black
and white, and thus allow me a fair opportunity of clearing myself
of my supposed delinquencies? Other men&mdash;I will merely quote
Colonel Greathed and Lieut.-Colonel Norman&mdash;are permitted to
take service in England, and yet to retain their military service
in India.</p>

<p>"In the time of the Court of Directors, an officer might be serving
the Foreign Office and India too, as in the case of Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton, late Consul at Zanzibar; but since the amalgamation,
the officers of her Majesty's Indian Army hope that they may take
any appointment in any part of the world, as a small recompense
for their losses; <i>i.e.</i> supercession and inability to sell their commissions,
after having paid for steps."</p></blockquote>

<p>At first he wanted to try me, so he pretended he did not like my
going to Confession, and I used to say, "Well, my religion teaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
me that my first duty is to obey you," and I did not bother to go;
so he at once took off this restraint, and used to send me to Mass,
and remind me of fish-days. It astonished me, the wonderful way
he knew our doctrine, and frequently explained things to me
that I did not know myself. He always wore his medal. I was
very much surprised, shortly after we were married, at my husband
giving me £5. Whilst he had been away one of my brothers had
met with a sudden death; his horse had fallen on him and crushed
him in a moment. He said, "Take this and have Masses said with
it for your poor brother." I only thought then what generosity and
what good taste it was. He was always delighted with the society
of priests&mdash;not so much foreign priests, as English ones&mdash;especially
if he got hold of a highly educated, broad theologian of a Jesuit;
but in all cases he was most courteous to <i>any</i> of them, and protected
them and their Missions whenever he was in a position to do so.
Once he went with me to a midnight Mass, and he cried all the
time. I could not understand it, and he said he could not explain
it himself. I had no idea then that he had ever been once received
into our Church in India. He <i>always</i> bowed his head at "Hallowed
be Thy Name," and he did that to the day of his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Delightful_Days_at_Country_Houses"></a>Delightful Days at Country Houses.</i></div>

<p>We passed delightful days at country houses, notably at Lord
Houghton's (Fryston), where, at his house in the country, and his
house in Brook Street, and at Lord Strangford's house in Great
Cumberland Place, we met all that was worth meeting of rank
and fashion, beauty and wit, and <i>especially</i> all the most talented
people in the world. I can shut my eyes and mentally look round
his (Lord Houghton's) large round table even <i>now</i>, which usually
held twenty-five guests. I can see Buckle, and Carlyle, and all the
Kingsleys, and Swinburne, and Froude, and all the great men that
were, and many that are, for the last thirty-two years, and remember
a great deal of the conversation. But I am not here to describe
them, but to give a description of Richard Burton. I can remember
the Due d'Aumale cheek by jowl with Louis Blanc. The present
Lord Houghton, and his two sisters, Lady Fitzgerald and the
Hon. Mrs. Henniker, were babes in the nursery. I can remember
the good old times in the country, at Fryston, where breakfast
was at different little round tables, so people came down when
they liked, and sat at one or another, and he would stroll from
one table to another, with a book in his hand. Swinburne was
then a boy, and had just brought out his "Queen Mother Rosamund,"
and Lord Houghton brought it up to us, saying, "I bring
you this little book, because the author is coming here this evening,
so that you may not quote him as an absurdity to himself." I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
remember Vambéry telling us Hungarian tales, and I can remember
Richard cross-legged on a cushion, reciting and reading "Omar el
Khayyâm" alternately in Persian and English, and chanting the
call to prayer, "Allahhu Akbar."</p>

<p>My Society recollections, my happy days, are all of the pleasantest
and most interesting. The evil day came far too soon; this
was a large oasis of seven months in my life, and even if I had had
no other it would have been worth living for. We went down to
Worthing to my family, where we passed a very happy time, and he
here gave me a proof of affection which I shall never forget. He
had gone to see his cousin, Samuel Burton, at Brighton, and had
promised to be back by the last train, but he did not make his
appearance. I was in a dreadful state of mind lest anything should
have happened to him. He arrived about one in the morning, pale
and worn out. He had gone to sleep in the train, and had been
carried some twenty miles away from Worthing. He could get no
kind of conveyance, being in the night; so, inquiring in what
direction Worthing lay, and settling the matter by a pocket compass,
he started across country, and between a walk and a sort of
long trot, from nine to one, he reached me, instead of waiting,
as another man would have done, till the next morning for a train
back.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_goes_to_West_Africa"></a>Richard goes to West Africa.</i></div>

<p>I shall never forget when the time came to part, and I was to go to
Liverpool to see him off, for he would not allow me to accompany
him till he had seen what Fernando Po was like. It was in August,
1861, when we went down to Liverpool, and we were very sad,
because he was not going to a Consulate where we could hope to
remain together as a <i>home</i>. It was a deadly climate, and we were
always going to be climate-dodging. I was to go out, not now, but
later, and then, perhaps, not to land, and to return and ply up and
down between Madeira and Teneriffe and London, and I, knowing he
had Africa at his back, was in a constant agitation for fear of his doing
more of these Explorations into unknown lands. There were about
eighteen men (West African merchants), and everybody took him
away from me, and he had made me promise that if I was allowed
to go on board and see him off, that I would not cry and unman
him. It was blowing hard and raining; there was one man who was
inconsiderate enough to accompany and stick to us the whole time,
so that we could not exchange a word (how I hated him!). I went
down below and unpacked his things and settled his cabin, and
saw to the arrangement of his luggage. My whole life and soul
was in that good-bye, and I found myself on board the tug, which
flew faster and faster from the steamer. I saw a white handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
go up to his face. I then drove to a spot where I could see the
steamer till she became a dot.</p>

<h4>WEST COAST OF AFRICA&mdash;RICHARD'S FIRST CONSULATE.</h4>


<p>In his "Wanderings in West Africa" (2 vols., 1863), Richard
describes the whole of his jurisdiction, which was several hundred
miles of coast. The ship, after leaving Madeira and Teneriffe, goes to
Bathurst on the West Coast, to Sierra Leone, Monrovia, Grand Bassa,
Cape Palmas, Half Jack, Grand Baltam, Axim, Elmina, Cape Coast
Castle, Salt Pond, Winnebah, Accra, Addah, Quitta, Bagadah,
Agwey, Whydah, Lagos, Bonny, Fernando Po, and Old Calabar,
one station beyond. He ends up with&mdash;"Arriving in these outer
places is the very abomination of desolation. I drop, for a time,
my pen, in the distinct memory of having felt uncommonly suicidal
through that first night at Fernando Po."</p>

<p>It would not suit this book to have large copyings from his
works, but I think I should give two which are especially useful&mdash;one
a description of the Sierra Leone negro, and another on the
richness of the Guinea Coast, about which I shall have something to
say later on in 1881.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_West_African_Negroes"></a>The West African Negroes.</i></div>

<p>"We parted with our consumptives at Madeira; we leave our
Africans at Sierra Leone. For this race there is a descending scale
of terminology: 1, European; 2, civilized man; 3, African; 4, man&mdash;the
Anglo-Americans say, 'pussum'&mdash;of colour; 5, negro; 6,
darkie; 7, nigger, which last, is actionable. Many a £5 has been
paid for the indulgence of <i>lèse majesté</i> against the 'man and a
brother;' and not a few £50 where the case has been brought
into the civil courts. Captain Philip Beaver was justified in
declaring that he would 'rather carry a rattlesnake than a negro&mdash;who
has been in London.' Not so Mr. Hazelface, into whose soul
or countenance <i>soggezzione</i>, or shame, never entered&mdash;for was he
not of the Almighty Negroes? And shall not the most dishonest of
Negroes in these days stand before Kings? The second, our Gorilla,
or Missing Link, was the son of an emancipated slave, who afterwards
distinguished himself as a Missionary and a Minister. His&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
sire's&mdash;name has appeared in many books, and he wrote one himself,
pitying his own 'poor lost father,' because, forsooth, he died in the
religion of his ancestors, an honest Fetishist. Our excellent warm-hearted,
ignorant souls at home were so delighted with the report
of this Lion of the Pulpit, that it was much debated whether the
boy Ajáí had not been providentially preserved for the Episcopate
of Western Africa.</p>

<p>"These individuals are out of their <i>assiettes</i>. At home they will
devour, perforce, <i>Kankey</i> and bad fish, washing them down with
<i>Mimbo</i> and <i>Pitta</i>&mdash;native and palm wine, and hop-less beer&mdash;here
they abuse the best of beef, long openly for 'palaver sauce' and
'palm-oil chop,' and find fault with their champagne. At home
they will wear breech-clouts and Nature's stockings, only. Here
their coats are superfine Saxony, with broadest of silk velvet
collars. The elongated cocoa-nut head bears jauntily a black pork-pie
felt, with bright azure ribbons, and a rainbow necktie vies in
splendour with the loudest of waistcoats from the land of Moses
and Son; the pants are tightly strapped down to show the grand
formation of the knee, the delicate slimness of the calf, the manly
purchase of the heel, and the waving line of beauty that distinguishes
the shin-bone.<a name="FNanchor_1_109" id="FNanchor_1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_109" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There are portentous studs upon a glorious breadth
of shirt, a small investment of cheap, gaudy, tawdry rings sets off the
chimpanzee-like fingers, and when in the open air, lemon-coloured
gloves invest the hands, whose horny reticulated skin reminds me
of the scaly feet of those cranes which pace at ease over the burning
sand, for which strong slippers are not strong enough for us; whilst
feet of the same order, but slightly superior in point of proportional
size, are tightly packed into patent-leather boats, the latter looking
as if they had been stuffed with some inanimate substance, say the
halves of a calf's head.</p>

<p>"It is hardly fair to deride a man's hideousness, but it is where
personal deformity is accompanied by conceit. Once upon a time
we all pitied an individual who by acclamation was proclaimed the
ugliest man in the B&mdash;&mdash; army, which is not saying a little.
'Poor E&mdash;&mdash;!' his friends would exclaim; 'it's no matter if a chap's
plain, but <i>he</i> is revolting,' and they commiserated him accordingly.
Once, however, he was detected by his chums looking into a shaving-glass,
and thus soliloquizing: 'Well, E&mdash;&mdash;, I declare you'd be a
deuced handsome fellow if you had but a better nose.' The discreet
chum, of course, spread the story, and from that moment our compassion
departed.</p>

<p>"No one, also, is more hopeless about the civilization of Africa
than the semi-civilized African returning to the 'home of his fathers.'
One feels how hard has been his own struggle to emerge from
barbarism. He acknowledges in his own case a selection of species,
and he sees no end to the centuries before there can be a nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
equal even to himself. Yet in <i>England</i>, and in <i>books</i>, he will cry
up the Majesty of African kings; he will give the people whom he
thoroughly despises a thousand grand gifts of morals and industry,
and extenuate, or rather ignore, all their faults and shortcomings.
I have heard a negro assert, with the unblushing effrontery which
animates the negro speechifying in Exeter Hall, or before some learned
society, that&mdash;for instance, at Lagos, a den of thieves&mdash;theft is unknown,
and that men leave their money with impunity in the store-house,
or on the highway. After which, he goes home, 'tongue in
cheek,' despising the facility with which an Englishman and his
money are parted.</p>

<p>"Our Africans left the ship without, on our part, or probably on
theirs, a single regret. Not so with the Mandengas. The honest
and manly bearing of these Moslems&mdash;so wonderful a contrast with
those caricatures in pork-pie and peg-topped broadcloth&mdash;had prepossessed
me strongly in their favour. We shook hands, and in
broken Arabic bade each other a kindly Allah-speed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Black_Man_is_raised_above_the_White_Man"></a>The Black Man is raised above the White Man.</i></div>

<p>"The white man's position is rendered far more precarious on
the coast than it might be, <i>if the black man were always kept in his
proper place</i>. A European without stockings or waistcoat, and
with ragged slops hanging about his limbs, would not be admitted
into the cuddy; an African will. Many of the fellows come on
board to make money by picking a quarrel. And what does one
think of a dusky belle, after dropping her napkin at Government
House, saying to her neighbour, 'Please, Mr. Officer-man, pick up
my towel'? Or of such a dialogue as this? The steward has neglected
to supply soup to some negro, who at every meal has edged himself
higher up towards the top of the table, and whose conversation
consists of whispering into the ears of an adjacent negro, and of
hyæna-like guffaws.</p>

<p>"'I say, daddee, I want <i>my</i> soop; all de passengers, he drink 'im
soop; <i>me</i> no drink <i>my</i> soop: what he mean, dis palaver?'</p>

<p>"The words are uttered in a kind of scream; the steward cannot
help smiling, and the nigger resumes&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ah, you laff! And for why you laff? I no laff; no drinkee
soop!'</p>

<p>"Here the dialogue ends, and the ladies look their acknowledgments
that travelling does throw us into strange society.</p>

<p>"From the moment of our arrival, 'negro palaver' began. A
<i>cause célèbre</i>, which will be referred home, had just been brought to
a close. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, a civilian official in the colony, after thrice
warning out of his compound a troublesome negro and a suspected
thief, had applied a certain <i>vis à tergo</i>, and had ejected the trespasser,
not, however, with unnecessary violence. In England the case
would have been settled by a police magistrate, and the fine, if any,
would have been half a crown. At Freetown the negro, assisted by
his friends or 'company,' betakes himself to a lawyer. The latter
may be a mulatto, possibly a pettifogger, certainly a moneyless man
who lives in a wretched climate for the pure purposes of lucre; his
interest is of course to promote litigation, and he fills his pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
by what is called 'sharp practice.' After receiving the preliminary
fee of £5, he demands exemplary damages. The consequence was
that Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; was lightened of £50.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/manwhowins.jpg" width="350" alt="drawing" />
<p class="capt">THE MAN WHO WINS.</p>
</div>

<p>"These vindictive cases are endless; half an hour's chat will bring
out a dozen, and, as at Aden, the Sons of the White Cliff have
nothing to do but to quarrel and to recount their grievances. A
purser of the African S.S. Company, finding a West Indian negro
substituting dead for live turkeys, called him a 'tief.' The 'tief'
laid an action for £1000, and the officer was only too happy to
escape with the retainer, three guineas. The same, when a black
came on board for a package, sent him off to the quarter-deck; the
fellow became insolent, when a military man present exclaimed,
'If you gave <i>me</i> that cheek, I'd have you overboard!' The negro
put off, took two of his friends as witnesses, procured an affidavit
that the white man had threatened him, and laid an action for
defamation of character, etc.; damages £50&mdash;a favourite sum.
Despite a counter oath, signed by two or three English officers,
one of them a colonel, to the effect that no bad language had been
used except by the plaintiff, whose insolence had been unbearable,
the defendant was compelled to make an apology, and to pay £15
costs. Another told me that for raising a stick to an insolent
servant, he was 'actioned' for £50, and escaped by compromise
for £12. When the defendant is likely to leave the station, the
<i>modus operanda</i> is as follows:&mdash;A writ of summons is issued. The
lawyer strongly recommends an apology for the alleged offence and
a promise to pay costs, warning the offender at the same time that
judgment will go against him if absent by default. Should the
defendant prudently 'stump up,' the thing ends; if not, a <i>capias</i> is
taken out, and the law runs its course. A jury is chosen. The
British Constitution determines that a man must be tried by his
peers. His peers at Sierra Leone are perhaps a dozen full-blooded
blacks, liberated slaves, half-reformed fetishmen, sometimes with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
sneaking fondness for the worship of Shángo, and if not criminals in
their own country, at least pauper-clad in dish-clouts and palm oil.
To see such peers certainly 'takes pride down a peg,' as the phrase
is; no use to think of that ancestor who 'came over' with the
Conqueror, or that Barony lost in the days of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>"No one raises the constitutional question, 'Are these half-reclaimed
barbarians my peers?' And if he did, justice would sternly answer
'Yes!' The witnesses will forswear themselves&mdash;not like our porters,
for half a crown, but <i>gratis</i>, because the plaintiff is a fellow-tribesman.
The judge may be 'touched with the tar-brush,' but be he white as
milk, he must pass judgment according to verdict, and when damages
are under £200, there is no appeal.</p>

<p>"Sierra Leone contains many sable families&mdash;Lumpkins, Lewis,
Pratt, Ezidio, Nicols, Macarthy, are a few of their patronymics,&mdash;against
whom it is useless for a stranger to contend and come off scot
and lot free. Besides these, there are seventeen chief and two hundred
minor tribes, whilst a hundred languages, according to M. Koelle,&mdash;one
hundred and fifty, says Bishop Vidal&mdash;are spoken in the streets of
Freetown. All are hostile to one another; all combine against the
white man. After the fashion of the Gold Coast, they have formed
themselves into independent republics, called 'companies.' These
set aside certain funds for their own advancement, and for the ruin
of their rivals. The most powerful and influential races are the Aku
and the Ibo.</p>

<p>"If the reader believes that I have exaggerated the state of things
at Sierra Leone, he is mistaken; the sketch is under rather than overdrawn.
And he will presently see a confirmation of these statements
in the bad name which these liberated Africans bear upon the whole
of the western coast.</p>

<p>"At breakfast we had been duly primed with good advice, viz. not
to notice impudence, and to turn our shoulders&mdash;the severest punishment&mdash;upon
all who tried their hands at annoyance. We rowed to
the Government landing, a rickety, slippery flight of wooden stairs,
which is positively dangerous at night, or when the waves dash
against the jetty. We were careful to carry no luggage; porters fight
for the job, and often let the object of emulation drop into the water.
One of our mail-bags received this <i>baptism de Sierra Leone</i> last night.
On such occasion a push or poke is a forbidden luxury; the man
might fall down&mdash;you have certainly injured him internally&mdash;you
must pay exemplary damages."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_inaugurates_a_Better_State_of_Things"></a>Richard inaugurates a Better State of Things.</i></div>

<p>Two stories are related about Richard. I do not vouch for
them, but they sound likely. One was, that when he arrived in
Africa, he found that the negroes were in the state above described,
assuming the upper hand, and treating the white men as an inferior
race. They were summoning them before tribunals on the most
trivial pretext, forwarding complaints home to pander to different
people, which a man who had lived in India, and had passed something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
like twenty-two years in black countries, was not the least
likely to stand. A day or two after his arrival at his post, a very
dandified-dressed and full-blooded nigger walked into the Consulate,
the window of which was not far from the ground, clapped Richard
on the back in the most jovial manner, with his disagreeable "yah-yah"
laugh. "How do, Consul? Come to shake hands&mdash;how do?"
holding out his black paw, as if he were a condescending Royalty.
There were some other Englishmen waiting about for different
business, looking curiously to see what was going to be the attitude
of the new Consul. He looked at the bumptious and loud-mannered
nigger, with a quiet stare of surprise, and then shouted, "Hi,
Kroo-boys, here; throw this nigger out of the window, will you?"
The Kroo-boys, his canoemen (of six oars), rushed in, delighted with
the commission, and flung him out. It was only a roll of three or
four feet&mdash;but no niggers in black coats and button-holes came to
clap the new Consul on the back after that, nor did they summon
him before the Tribunal.</p>

<p>Another story told was, that the merchants on the West Coast
were sorely put to inconvenience by the Captains of ships steaming
in, discharging their cargo, and steaming off again without giving
the merchants time to read and answer to their correspondence.
Commerce, therefore, was at a very low ebb, because the merchants
were a fortnight behind the world, there being only two steamers
a month at that time. They asked Richard in a body, if there was no
means of helping them. Richard got out the contracts, and saw that
they said "that the Captain of a ship should stop at the port <i>eighteen
hours' daylight</i> for that very purpose." The next ship that came in,
the Captain came and looked into the Consulate in a jovial way,
and said, "Now, Captain, hurry up with my papers; I want to be
off; going to clear out." Richard looked up at him with a surprised
stare, and drawled out lazily, "Oh, you can't go, for I have not
finished my letters!" "Oh, damn your letters, Sir! I'm off."
"Stop a bit," said Richard; "let us have a look at your contract?"
He pulled it out of the drawer. "The contract says that you shall
stop here eighteen hours' daylight, to give the merchants an opportunity
of receiving and answering their correspondence, otherwise
commerce would be ruined, the merchants being a fortnight behind
the world." "Oh yes," he said, "but nobody has ever enforced
that; the Consuls have never bothered us about that!" "Ha,"
said Richard, "more shame for them! Now, are you going to stay?"
"No, sir, not I!" "Very well, then; I am going up to the Governor's,
and I am going to shot two guns. If you go out <i>one minute</i> before
your eighteen hours' daylight expires&mdash;mind, I shall go up there and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
stay myself&mdash;I shall send the first gun right across your bows, and
the second slap into you. Mind, I am a man of my word. Good
morning!" He did not go out till half an hour after his eighteen
hours' daylight; and as long as Richard was there none of them
ever did.</p>

<p>"The Sierra Leone man is an inveterate thief; he drinks, he
gambles, he intrigues, he over-dresses himself, and when he has
exhausted his means, he makes Master pay for all. With a terrible
partiality for summoning and enjoying himself thoroughly in a
court of law, he enters into the spirit of the thing like an attorney's
clerk; he soon wearies of the less exciting life in the wilder settlements,
where debauchery has not yet developed itself; home sickness
then seizes him, and he deserts, after probably robbing the house.
He is the horror of Europeans; the merchants of the Gaboon river
prefer forfeiting the benefits of the African Steam Ship Company to
seeing themselves invaded by this locust tribe, whose most beautiful
view is apparently that which leads out of Sierra Leone. At Lagos
and Abeokuta, Sierra Leone has returned to his natural paganism,
and has become an inveterate slave-dealer, impudently placing himself
under native protection, and renegading the flag that saved him
from life-long servitude. Even during the Blackland's short stay,
the unruly, disorderly character of the man often enough showed
itself by fisticuffing, pulling hair, and cursing, with a mixture of
English and African ideas, that presented a really portentous <i>tout
ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>"With respect to the relative position of Japhet and Ham&mdash;perhaps
I had better say Ham and Japhet&mdash;at Sierra Leone, I may remark
that English ultra-philanthropy has granted at times <i>almost all</i> the
wishes of the Ethiopian melodist&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'I wish de legislator would set dis darkie free,<br /></span>

</p>

<p>"I own that 'darkie' must be defended, and well defended, too,
from the injustice and cruelty of the class whom he calls 'poor
white trash.' But protection should be within the limits of <i>Reason</i>.
If the white man is not to be protected against the black man, why
should the Jamaica negro be protected against the coolie? Because
he requires it? I think not. Though physically speaking and
mentally weaker than his rival, he can hold quite enough of his own&mdash;as
Sierra Leone proves&mdash;by combination, which enables cattle to
resist lions. Displays of this sentiment on the part of the whites
must, of course, be repressed. Do so freely, but not unfairly.
England, however, is still in the throes of her first repentance. Like
a veteran devotee, she is atoning for the coquetries of her hot youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
But a few years ago she contracted to supply the Spanish colonies
for thirty years with four thousand eight hundred slaves per annum,
and she waged wars and destroyed Cities for a traffic which Cardinal
Cibo, at the end of the seventeenth century, on the part of the Sacred
College, to the Congoese missionaries, denounced as 'a pernicious
and abominable abuse.' For this, and for the 2,130,000 negroes
imported into the West Indian estates between A.D. 1680 and
A.D. 1786, Britannia yet mourns, and, Rachel-like, will not be comforted,
because those niggers are not. What the inevitable reaction
shall be, <i>quien sabe?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Method_of_protecting_the_Negro"></a>Method of protecting the Negro.</i></div>

<p>"I do not for a moment regret our philanthropy, even with its
terrible waste of life and gold. But England can do her duty to
Africa, without cant and without humbug.<a name="FNanchor_2_110" id="FNanchor_2_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_110" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She can contend with
a world in arms, if necessary, against the injurious traffic, but she
might abstain from violently denouncing all who do not share her
opinions upon the subject. Anti-slavery men have hitherto acted
rather from sentiment than from reason; and Mr. Buckle&mdash;alas!
that we should hear from him no more&mdash;may be right in determining
that morality must not rule, but be ruled by intellect. Let us open
our eyes to the truth, and eschewing 'zeal without knowledge,' secure
to ourselves the highest merit&mdash;perseverance in a good cause when
thoroughly disenchanted with it. We have one point in our favour.
The <i>dies atra</i> between 1810-1820, when a man could not speak or
write what he thought upon the subject of slavery, is drawing to a
close. Increased tolerance now permits us to express our opinions,
which, if in error, will wither like the grass in an African day; if
right, will derive fresh increase from time.</p>

<p>"There are several classes interested in pitting black man against
white man, and in winning the day for him, <i>coram publico</i>. An
unscrupulous missionary&mdash;it is the general policy of the English
propagandist to take violent parts in foreign politics&mdash;will for his
own ends preach resistance to time-honoured customs and privileges,
which the negro himself has conceded.<a name="FNanchor_3_111" id="FNanchor_3_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_111" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> An unworthy lawyer will
urge a lawsuit, with a view to filling his pockets; a dishonourable
Judge or police Magistrate will make a name for philanthropy at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
expense of equity and honour; a weak-minded man will fear the
official complaints, the false-memorializings which attend an unpopular
decision, and the tomahawking that awaits him from the
little army of negrophiles at home. But the worst class of all is
the mulatto, under which I include quadroon and octaroon. He is
everywhere, like wealth, <i>irritamenta malorum</i>. The 'bar-sinister,'
and the uneasy idea that he is despised, naturally fill him with
ineffable bile and bitterness. Inferior in point of <i>morale</i> to Europeans,
and as far as regards <i>physique</i> to Africans, he seeks strength
in making the families of his progenitors fall out. Many such men
visiting England are received, by virtue of their woolly hair and
yellow skin, into a class that would reject a fellow-countryman of
similar, nay, of far higher, position; and there are amongst them
infamous characters, who are not found out till too late. London is
fast learning to distinguish between the Asiatic <i>Mir</i> and the <i>Munshi</i>.
The real African, however&mdash;so enduring are the sentimentalisms of
Wilberforce<a name="FNanchor_4_112" id="FNanchor_4_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_112" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Buxton&mdash;is still to be understood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Teaching_Fair_Treatment_for_the_Negro"></a>Teaching Fair Treatment for the Negro.</i></div>

<p>"It is hardly fair to pull down one system without having another
ready in its stead. I therefore venture to suggest certain steps
toward regenerating&mdash;diffidently, though, on account of the amount
of change to be made in&mdash;our unhappy colony, which for years has
been steadily declining.</p>

<p>"Creoles, as children of liberated Africans are called here, should
be apprenticed for seven years, with superintendents to see that they
clear the soil, plant, and build; otherwise the apprenticeship would
be merely nominal. For the encouragement of agriculture, I would
take a very heavy tax from small shopkeepers and hucksters, who, by
virtue of sitting upon a shady board, before a few yards of calico
and strings of beads, call themselves merchants. Another very
heavy tax&mdash;at least £100 per annum&mdash;upon all grog-shop licences,
very few of which should be issued in the colony. Police magistrates
are perfectly capable of settling disputes amongst these people, and
of dealing out punishment to the offenders; moreover, in all cases
the fines should go to the Crown, not to the complainant: in civil
cases, however, there might be an appeal home for the benefit of
the litigious. This measure would wipe off at one sweep inducement
to engage in actions which the presence of a judicial establishment
suggests, and which causes such heart-burning between
Europeans and Africans. I would not allow a black jury to 'sit
upon' a white man, or <i>vice versâ</i>; and, in the exception of a really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
deserving mulatto, I would rather see him appointed Lord Lieutenant
or Secretary of Ireland than acting Governor or Secretary at Sierra
Leone.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that something of the kind will be done, when
the <i>real</i> state of affairs in this unfortunate colony is ventilated in
England. There are men who are always ready to let bad alone,
and to hold that&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'What has answer'd so long may answer still;'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>but the extension of Steam Navigation, and the increased number of
travellers and visitors, will not allow progress, for want of a little
energy, even at Sierra Leone, to be arrested.</p>

<p>"It is supposed that women, being less exposed than men, can
better resist the climate of Sierra Leone. I believe the fact to be the
contrary; in many cases the German missionaries have lived, whilst
their wives have died. Here lie three Spanish Consuls, who in four
years fell victims to a climate which has slain five Captains-General,
or Governors, in five years. A deserted cemetery, without flowers or
whitewash, is always a melancholy spectacle. This was something
more. The grass and bush grew dense and dank from the remnants
of mortality, and the only tree within the low decaying walls was a
poisonous oleander. Another sense than the eye was unpleasantly
affected; we escaped from the City of the Slain, as from a slave-ship
or from a plague hospital.</p>

<p>"Servants in shoals presented themselves, begging 'mas'er' to
take them down coast. In vain. The Sierra Leone man is handier
than his southern brother; he can mend a wheel, make a coffin, or
cut your hair, operations which in other places must remain
wanted. Yet no one, at least if not a perfect greenhorn on the
coast, will engage him in any capacity. In civility and respectfulness,
he is far below the Brazilian or the Cuban <i>emancipado</i>. He has
learned a 'trick or two;' even a black who has once visited Sierra
Leone is considered as spoiled for life, as if he spent a year in
England.</p>

<p>"An unexpected pleasure was in store for me. Lagos contains, as
has been said, some eight hundred Moslems, but not yet two
thousand, as it is reported. Though few, they have already risen to
political importance; in 1851, our bravest and most active opponents
were those wearing turbans. Among these are occasionally found
'white Arabs.' One had lately died at Ekpe, a village on the
'Cradoo waters,' where the ex-king Kosoko lives, and, though a
Pagan, affects the Faith. I was presently visited by the Shaykh Ali
bin Mohammed El Mekkáwi. The Reverend man was fair of face,
but no Meccan; he called himself a Máliki, as indeed are most
Moslems in this part of El Islam, and I guessed him to be a
Morocco pilgrim, travelling in the odour of sanctity. He was
accompanied by the Kazi Mohammed Ghana, a tall and sturdy
Hausa negro, with his soot-black face curiously gashed and scarred;
he appeared to me an honest man and a good Moslem. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
dignitaries were accompanied by a mob of men in loose trousers,
which distinguished them from the Pagan crowd; one of them, by
trade a tailor, had learned to speak Portuguese in the Brazil.</p>

<p>"Very delightful was this meeting of Moslem brethren, and we
took 'sweet counsel' together, as the Missionaries say. The
Shaykh Ali had wandered from Tripoli southwards, knew Bornu,
Sokatu, Hausa, and Adamáwá, the latter only by name; and he
seemed to have suffered but little from a long journey, of which he
spoke favourably. He wished me to return with him, and promised
me safe conduct. I refused, with a tightening of the heart, a little
alleviated, however, by the hope that Fate may spare me to march
at some future day through Central Africa homewards. And in that
hope I purified my property, by giving the <i>zakat</i>, or legal alms, to
the holy man, who palpably could not read or write, but who audibly
informed his followers that 'this bondsman' is intimately acquainted
with <i>kull'ilm&mdash;omnis res scibilis</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Benin was a great object of interest, and I quote these
few remarks anent the Niger for geographers, and then proceed to
the <i>gold</i>, in which millions are interested.&mdash;I. B.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Benin was visited by Captain Thomas Wyndham in 1553, and in
1823, Belzoni of the Pyramids left his bones near its banks.</p>

<p>"After Lagos we came to the Oil Rivers, and direct connection of
the Bonny river with the true Niger is still a subject of geographical
speculation: I hope to solve the problem, despite all its difficulties.</p>

<p>"It is opined that the Niger falls into the Gulf of Guinea by a
great delta, the Rio del Rey being the eastern, and the Great Rio
Formoso, or Benin,<a name="FNanchor_5_113" id="FNanchor_5_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_113" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> being its western limits. There are twenty-five
streams which discharge themselves into this Great Bight, six
of which are Oil Rivers&mdash;a disagreeable week's trip. This remarkable
hypothesis, right in the main, whilst wrong in detail, and characterized
at the time as 'hazardous and uncertain,' was probably suggested by
native testimony, the coasts of the Gulf of Guinea being well known
to French traders. It is hard indeed to comprehend how an
intelligent sailor could pass by these shores without suspecting them
to be the delta of some great stream. Caillié, the much-abused
discoverer of Timbuktu, wrote in 1828 these remarkable words: 'If
I may be permitted to hazard an opinion as to the course of the
River Dhioliba, I should say that it empties itself by several mouths
into the Gulf of Benin.'</p>

<p>"It is directly connected with the twenty or thirty millions of people
in the Sudan; the centres of trade are upon the stream, yet the long
and terrible caravan march of four months still supplies articles
more cheaply than we can afford to sell them, <i>viâ</i> the Niger.</p>

<p>"I lost all patience with Cape Coast Castle. Will our grandsons
believe that in these days a colony which cannot afford
£150 per annum for a stipendiary magistrate, that men who live
in a state of poverty, nay, of semi-starvation, are so deficient in
energy as to be content with sitting down hopelessly, whilst gold is
among their sands, on their roads, in their fields, in their very walls?
That this Ophir&mdash;that this California, where every river is a Tmolus
and a Pactolus, every hillock is a gold-hill&mdash;does not contain a cradle,
a puddling-machine, a quartz-crusher, a pound of mercury? That
half the washings are wasted because quicksilver is unknown, and that
pure gold, selling in England for £3 17<i>s.</i> to £4, is here purchaseable
for £3 12<i>s.</i>? I shout with Dominie Sampson, 'Prodigious!'</p>

<p>"Baron Humboldt first announced the theory that gold is constant
in meridional ranges of the paleozoic and metamorphic formations.
In this he was followed by Sir R. Murchison, and he was followed
by Professor Sedgwick. The latter 'has no faith whatever in the
above hypothesis, though it led to a happy anticipation,' which followed
erroneous premises. He continues, 'What we seem to know
is, that gold is chiefly found among paleozoic rocks of a quartzose
type,' and, moreover, that 'some of the great physical agencies of
the earth are meridional, and these agencies <i>may probably</i>&mdash;and in
a way we do not comprehend&mdash;have influenced the deposit of metals
on certain lines of bearing.' He thinks, however, it would be a
'hypothetical misdirection' to say that a quartzose paleozoic rock
cannot be auriferous, because its strata is not north and south, and
that 'experience must settle this point.' The supporters of the
meridional theory may quote as instances East Africa Ghauts, the
Oural Mountains, the Sierra Nevada of California&mdash;which included
the diggings in British Columbia&mdash;the Australian Cordillera, the
New Zealand ranges, and the Western Ghauts of India. On the
other hand, there are two notable exceptions&mdash;the Central Indian
region, in which Sir R. Martin and others, as long as thirty years
ago, were convinced that the natives washed for gold; and, still
more remarkable, the highly productive African chain, which, for
want of a better name, we still call the Kong Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_6_114" id="FNanchor_6_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_114" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"The fact is that gold is a superficial formation, and has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
almost universally distributed over the surface of earth's declivities.
This want of depth Sir R. Murchison is fond of illustrating by the
hand with the fingers turned downwards; they represent the golden
veins, whilst the palm denotes the main deposit. It is the contrary
with other metals. Gold-placers, therefore, are now rare, except in
newly explored or exploited lands of primitive formation, where it
is common, nay, almost universal; the article, whose utility was
early recognized, soon disappeared from the older workings. The
Californian digger, provided with pick, pan, and shovel, made $10
per diem in 1852; in 1862 he still makes $2.50, and in 1872 he
probably will make $0. The anciently auriferous countries,
especially Arabia, have been stripped of their treasure, perhaps
before the dawn of what is called true history;<a name="FNanchor_7_115" id="FNanchor_7_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_115" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and if they linger
in Sofala, it is by reason of the people's ignorance;<a name="FNanchor_8_116" id="FNanchor_8_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_116" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> they never
traced the metal to its matrix.</p>

<p>"Setting aside the vexed question of the identity of Ophir and
Sofala, and the fact that in early times gold was brought down from
the eastern regions of the upper Nilotic basin, Western Africa was
the first field that supplied the precious metal to Europe. The
French claim to have imported it from Elmina as early as A.D. 1382.
In 1442, Gonçales Baldeza returned from his second voyage to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
regions about Bojador, bringing with him the first gold. Presently
a company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the gold
trade between Portugal and Africa; its leading men were the
navigators, Lanzarote and Gilianez, and the great Prince Henry
did not disdain to become a shareholder. In 1471 João de
Santarem and Pedro Escobar reached a place on the Gold Coast,
to which, from the abundance of gold found there, they gave the
name of Oura da Mina, the present Elmina. After this a flood of
gold poured into the lap of Europe, and at last, cupidity having
mastered terror of the Papal Bull, which assigned to Portugal the
exclusive right to the Eastern hemisphere, English, French, and
Dutch adventurers hastened to share the spoils.</p>

<p>"The Portuguese, probably foreseeing competition in the Atlantic
waters, but sure of their power in the Indian seas, determined,
about the middle of the sixteenth century, to seek gold, of which
those who preceded them had heard, in Eastern Africa. The Rev.
Father João dos Santos, of the order of San Domingo, has left us,
in his 'History of Eastern Ethiopia,' a detailed account of the
first disastrous expedition. According to him, Dom Sebastian was
scarcely seated on the throne of Portugal<a name="FNanchor_9_117" id="FNanchor_9_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_117" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> before he sent to Sofala
an expedition under command of Francis Baretto, who 'penetrated
into Macoronga,'<a name="FNanchor_10_118" id="FNanchor_10_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_118" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and 'Maniça,' discovered mines of gold in these
kingdoms, of which, by his prudence and valour, he made himself
master. Baretto, having successfully passed through, despite a
harassing warfare, the territories of the Quiteva or sovereign of Sofala,
who fled from his capital, Zimboe, and having contracted with the
Moorish or Arab Sultan<a name="FNanchor_11_119" id="FNanchor_11_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_119" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of Maniça a treaty of amity, which included
the article that the King of Chicanga should admit the strangers to
trade throughout his territories for gold dust and other merchandise,
reached at length the goal of his ambition. His proceedings are told
as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_12_120" id="FNanchor_12_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_120" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"'The Portuguese were enchanted at having, in so short a time,
concluded a treaty of such advantage to their sovereign, and so
beneficial to the realm; they, moreover, flattered themselves with the
hope of acquiring a store of gold, with which to return enriched to
their country; but when they saw what toil was requisite for extracting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
this precious metal from the bowels of the earth, and the danger
incurred by those who worked in the mines, they were speedily
undeceived, and no longer regarded their fortunes as instantaneously
made. At the same time, they were induced to reflect that the
labour and risk of digging the gold from the abysses whence it is
drawn, are such as to stamp that value on it which it bears from its
consequent rarity.</p>

<p>"'These people have divers methods of extracting the gold, and
separating it from the earth with which it is blended; but the
most common is to open the ground, and proceed towards the spot
where, from certain indications, ore is supposed to abound. For this
purpose they excavate vaults, sustained at intervals by pillars, and
notwithstanding they make use of every possible precaution, it often
happens that the vaults give way, and bury the subterranean sappers
beneath their ruins. When they reach the vein in which the gold is
found, mixed with the earth, they take the ore as it is and put it into
vessels full of water, and by dint of stirring about the water the earth
is dissolved, and the gold remains at the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_13_121" id="FNanchor_13_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_121" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"'They likewise take advantage of heavy rains, which, occasioning
torrents, carry before them whatever loose earth they meet in their
way, and thus lay open the spots where gold is embedded in the
ravines. This the Caffres collect, and wash with care to purify from
the grosser parts of its earthy admixture.</p>

<p>"'These people also, however unpolished they may seem, yet
possess a secret, peculiar to themselves, for discovering the gold concealed
in certain stones, which they likewise have the ingenuity of
extracting, constantly observing the same practice of washing it well
to separate all earthy particles from the metal, and thus rendering it
equally lustrous with that obtained from the earth. This gold is,
however, much cheaper than the other, either owing to its being
more common, or to its being obtained with more facility and at less
expense than that exfoliated from the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>"'It is a mere matter of fact that this country is rich in gold and
silver mines, but these metals are not so easily obtained as is
imagined, for the Caffres are prohibited, under penalty of death and
the confiscation of their property, from discovering the site of the
mine, either to their neighbours, or to those who pass through their
country. When a mine is discovered, the persons finding it make
wild outcries, to collect witnesses round them, and cover the spot,
above which they place some object to denote the site; and far from
being susceptible to be prevailed upon by strangers to point out
these spots, they avoid encountering them as much as possible, for
fear they should even be suspected of such a deed.</p>

<p>"'The motive of the sovereign for enacting these prohibitory laws,
and for exacting a declaration to be made to the Court of all mines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
discovered, is that he may take possession of them,<a name="FNanchor_14_122" id="FNanchor_14_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_122" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and by preventing
the Portuguese from becoming masters of one portion, give no
room for succeeding warfare on their part to seize on the remainder.'</p>

<p>"The melancholy fate of Baretto's expedition deserves mentioning.
After passing through Zimbo,<a name="FNanchor_15_123" id="FNanchor_15_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_123" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> where the Quiteva received him with
open arms, Baretto returned to Sofala. Being now on good terms
with the sovereigns of that place, and of Chicanga, he resolved to
open a road into the kingdom of Mongas, the dominions of the
Monomotapa, who opposed him with a large army. Baretto signally
defeated the 'Caffres,' and reached Chicona, where he found no gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
mines. An artful native, however, buried two or three lumps of
silver, which, when discovered, brought large presents to the cheat and
dreams of Potosi to the cheated.<a name="FNanchor_16_124" id="FNanchor_16_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_124" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Baretto, in nowise disheartened
by discovering the fraud, left two hundred men in a fort at Chicona,
whilst he and the remainder of his force retired upon Sena, on the
Zambeze. The Caffres then blockaded the fort, and having reduced
the gallant defenders to a famine, compelled them to make a sortie,
in which every man was slain.</p>

<p>"The ruins of Maniça, north-west of Sofala, and west of and
inland from the East African ghauts, are described as being situated
in a valley enclosed by an amphitheatre of hills, having a circuit
of about two miles. According to Mr. M'Leod, the district is called
Matouca (the Matuka of Dr. Livingstone's map), and the gold-washing
tribes Botongos.<a name="FNanchor_17_125" id="FNanchor_17_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_125" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The spots containing the metal are
known by the bare and barren surface. The natives dig in any
small crevice made by the rains of the preceding winter, and there
find gold dust. These pot-holes are rarely deeper than two or three
feet, at five or six they strike the ground-rock. In the still portions
of the rivers, when they are low, the natives dive for nuggets
that have been washed down from the hills. Sometimes joining
together in hundreds, they deflect the stream, and find extensive
deposits. Mr. M'Leod heard of mines four to five hundred miles from
Sofala, where the gold is found in solid lumps, or as veins in the
rocks and stones.</p>

<p>"The result of Dr. Livingstone's travels is, that whilst he found
no gold in the African interior, frequent washings were met with in
the Mashinga Mountains<a name="FNanchor_18_126" id="FNanchor_18_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_126" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and on the Zambeze river; no silver,
however, was met with, nor could the people distinguish it from tin,
which, however, does not establish its non-existence; he heard from
a Mashanga man, for the first time, a native name for gold, <i>Dalama</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_127" id="FNanchor_19_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_127" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The limits of the auriferous region are thus laid down: 'If we
place one leg of the compasses at Tete, and extend the other 3° 30',
bringing it round from the north-east of Tete by west, and then
to the south-east, we nearly touch or include all the known gold-producing
country.' This beginning from the north-east would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
include the Marave country,<a name="FNanchor_20_128" id="FNanchor_20_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_128" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the now 'unknown' kingdom of
Abutua<a name="FNanchor_21_129" id="FNanchor_21_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_129" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> placed, however, south of the Zambesi, and coming round
by the south-west, Mashona, or Bazizulu, Maniça, and Sofala.
Gold from about Maniça is as large as wheat grains, whilst that
found in the rivers is in minute scales. The process of washing the
latter is laborious. 'A quantity of sand is put into a wooden bowl
with water, a half-rotatory motion is given to the dish, which causes
the coarser particles of sand to collect on one side of the bottom.
These are carefully removed with the hand, and the process of rotation
is renewed until the whole of the sand is taken away, and the gold
alone remains.'<a name="FNanchor_22_130" id="FNanchor_22_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_130" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Mercury is as usual unknown. Formerly one
hundred and thirty pounds of gold were submitted to the authorities
at Tete for taxation, but when the slave-trade began, the Portuguese
killed the goose with the golden eggs, and the annual amount
obtained is now only eight to ten pounds.</p>

<p>"It is evident that gold is by no means half worked in Eastern
Africa. As in California, it appears to be found in clay shale, which
for large profits requires 'hydraulicking.' The South African
traveller heard that at the range Mashinga, the women pounded the
soft rock in wooden mortars, previous to washing; it is probably
rotten quartz, and the yield would be trebled by quicksilver and
crushers.</p>

<p>"It is highly probable that the gold formations in those East
African ghauts, which Dr. Beke is compelling to become the 'Lunar
Mountains,' are by no means limited to the vicinity of the Zambeze.
In gold-prospecting, as every geologist knows, the likeliest places
often afford little yield and sometimes none. The author of 'The
Lake Regions of Central Africa' describes a cordillera which he
struck, about a hundred miles from the eastern coast, as primitive,
quartzose, and shaly; unfortunately time and health hindered him
from exploring it. The same writer, in 'First Footsteps in East
Africa' (p. 395), indicates such formation in the small ghauts, and
on the western side of that range he is reported to have found gold.
What steps he took do not appear; he was probably disheartened
by the reflection that all his efforts would be opposed by might and
main in official circles. Possibly he feared the fate of Mr. Hargreaves,
of Australia, who obtained a reward of £5000, when one
per cent. of export would have made him master of eight millions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Local jealousies at Aden also certainly would have defeated his
plans, if permitted to be carried out; and the Court of Directors
had already regarded with a holy terror his proposals to build a
little fort, by way of base upon the seaboard near Berberah.
Leaving, however, these considerations, we are justified by analogy
of formation and bearing in believing that at some future time gold
may be one of the exports from Eastern Intertropical Africa.<a name="FNanchor_23_131" id="FNanchor_23_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_131" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"Returning to Western Africa, we find in Leo Africanus, who is
supposed to have died about 1526, that the King of Ghana had in
his palace 'an entire lump of gold'&mdash;a monster nugget it would
now be called&mdash;not cast nor wrought by instruments, but perfectly
formed by the Divine Providence only, of thirty pounds weight,
which had been bored through and fitted for a seat before the royal
throne.<a name="FNanchor_24_132" id="FNanchor_24_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_132" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The author most diffuse upon the subject of gold, is
Bosman, who treats, however, solely of the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>"The first region which he mentions is Dinkira, under which were
included the conquered provinces of Wásá (our Wassaw, Wossa,
Wasau, Warsaw, etc.), Encasse and Juffer, each bordering upon one
another, and the last upon Commany (Commanda). There the gold
is fine, but much alloyed with 'fetishes,' oddly shaped figures used
for ornaments, and composed sometimes of pure mountain gold, but
more often mixed with one-third, or even half, of silver and copper
and filled inside with half weight of the heavy black earth used for
moulding them. The second was Acanny, the people of which
brought the produce of their own diggings and of their neighbours
of Ashantee and Akim: it was so pure and fine, that the negroes
called all the best gold 'Acanny Sika,' or Acanny gold. The third
was Akim,<a name="FNanchor_25_133" id="FNanchor_25_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_133" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which 'furnished as large quantities of gold as any land
that I know, and that also the most valuable and pure of any that
is carried away from this coast; it is easily distinguished by its deep
colour.' The fourth and fifth are Ashanti and Ananse, a small
province between the former empire and Dinkira. The sixth and
last is Awine, our Aowin,<a name="FNanchor_26_134" id="FNanchor_26_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_134" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which formerly used to export large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
quantities of fine and pure gold, and they 'being the civilized and
the fairest dealers of all the negroes,' the Dutch 'traded with them
with a great deal of pleasure.' They were, however, finally subdued
by the Dinkiras.</p>

<p>"According to Bosman ('Letters,' vi.) 'the illustrious metal' was
found in three sites. The first and best was 'in or between particular
hills:' the negroes sank pits there, and separated the soil
adhering to it. The second 'is in, at, and about some rivers and
waterfalls, whose violence washeth down great quantities of earth, which
carry the gold with it. The third is on the seashore, near the mouths
of rivulets, and the favourite time for washing is after violent night
rains.<a name="FNanchor_27_135" id="FNanchor_27_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_135" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The negro women are furnished with large and small troughs
or trays, which they first fill full of earth and sand, which they wash
with repeated fresh water till they have cleansed it from all its earth;
and if there be any gold its ponderosity forces it to the bottom of
the trough, which if they find it is thrown into the small tray, and
so they go on washing it again, which operation generally holds
them till noon; some of them not getting above the value of
sixpence; some of them pieces of six or seven shillings, though not
frequently; and often they entirely lose their labour.'</p>

<p>"The gold thus dug is of two kinds, dust gold and mountain gold.
The former is 'fine as flour,' and the more esteemed because there is
no loss in melting. The latter, corresponding with our modern
'nugget,' varies in weight from a farthing to two hundred guineas;
it touches better than gold dust, but it is a loss from the metal
adhering to the stone.</p>

<p>"The natives, in Bosman's day&mdash;and to the present time&mdash;were
'very subtle artists in the sophisticating of gold.' The first sort was
the fetish before alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_28_136" id="FNanchor_28_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_136" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They also cast pieces so artificially,
that whilst outside there was pure gold thick as a knife, the interior
was copper, and perhaps iron&mdash;then a new trick and the most
dangerous, because difficult to detect. The common 'false mountain
gold' was a mixture of the precious metal with silver and copper,
extremely high coloured, and unless each piece was touched, the
fraud passed undetected. Another kind was an artificially cast and
tinged powder of coral mixed with copper filings; it became
tarnished, however, in a month or two. The official tests of gold
were as follows:&mdash;If offered at night or in the evening large pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
were cut through with a knife, and the smaller nuggets were beaten
with a stone, and then tried as above. Gold dust was cast into
a copper brazier, winnowing with the fingers, and blown upon with
the breath, which causes the false gold to fly away. These are not
highly artificial tests. Bosman, however, strongly recommends them
to raw, inexpert people (especially seafaring men), whom he bids to
remember the common proverb, that 'there is no gold without dross.'
These greenhorns, it seems, tested the metal by pouring aquafortis
upon it, when ebullition or the appearance of green proved it to be
false or mixed. 'A miserable test, indeed!' exclaims old Trunk-hose,
justly remarking that an eighth or tenth part of alloy would produce
those appearances, and that such useless and niceness, entailing the
trouble of drying, and causing the negroes to suffer, is prejudicial
to trade.</p>

<p>"With respect to the annual export from the Gold Coast, Bosman
reckons it in peaceful times, when trade is prosperous, to be '23
tun.' The 7000 marks are disposed of as below.<a name="FNanchor_29_137" id="FNanchor_29_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_137" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Mr. Macqueen
estimates this exportation at £3,406,275. The English trade has
now fallen to £360,000 to £400,000 per annum.<a name="FNanchor_30_138" id="FNanchor_30_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_138" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>"The conclusion of Bosman's sixth letter may be quoted as highly
applicable to the present day. 'I would refer to any intelligent
metallist, whether a vast deal of ore must not of necessity be lost
here, from which a great deal of gold might be separated, from want
of skill in the metallic art; and not only so, but I firmly believe that
large quantities of pure gold are left behind, for the negroes only
ignorantly dig at random, without the least knowledge of the veins
of the mines. And I doubt not but if this country belonged to the
Europeans, they would soon find it to produce much richer treasures
than the negroes obtain from it; but it is not probable that we shall
ever possess that liberty here, wherefore we must be content with
being so far masters of it as we are at present, which, if well and
prudently managed, would turn to a very great account.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>"In several countries, as Dinkira, Tueful, Wásá,<a name="FNanchor_31_139" id="FNanchor_31_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_139" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and especially
Akim, the hill region lying due north of Accra, the people are still
active in digging gold. The pits, varying from two to three feet in
diameter, and from twelve to fifty feet deep, are often so near the
roads that loss of life has been the result. 'Shoring-up' being little
known, the miners are not unfrequently buried alive. The stuff is
drawn up by ropes in clay pots, or calabashes, and thus a workman
at the bottom widens the pit to a pyriform shape: tunnelling, however,
is unknown. The excavated earth is carried down to be
washed. Besides sinking these holes, they pan in the beds of rivers,
and in places collect quartz, which is roughly pounded. The yield
is very uncertain, and the Chief of the district is entitled to one-third
of the proceeds. During the busy season, when water is abundant,
the scene must resemble that described by Dr. Livingstone, near the
gold-diggings of Tete. As in California and Australia, prices rise
high, and gunpowder, rum, and cotton goods soon carry off the
gold dust.</p>

<p>"During the repeated earthquakes of July, 1862, which laid waste
Accra, the strata of the Akim Hills were so much shaken and
broken up, that, according to report, all the people flocked to
the diggings and dispensed with the shafts generally sunk. There
are several parts of the Gold Coast where the precious metal is
fetish, and where the people will not dig themselves, though perhaps
they would not object to strangers risking their lives. One of the
most remarkable is the Devil's Hill, called by Bosman 'Monte da
Diabo,' near Winnebah, in the Aguna (Agouna) country. In his
time, a Mr. Baggs, English agent, was commissioned by the African
Company to prospect it. He died at Cape Coast Castle before
undertaking a work which, in those days, would have been highly
dangerous. Some authorities fix the Seecom river as the easternmost
boundary where gold is found. This is so far incorrect, that I have
panned it from the sands under James Fort. Besides which, it is
notorious that on the banks of the Upper Volta, about the latitude of
the Krobo (Croboe) country, there are extensive deposits, regarded
by the people as sacred.</p>

<p>"The Slave Coast is a low alluvial tract, and appears to be wholly
destitute of gold.<a name="FNanchor_32_140" id="FNanchor_32_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_140" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> According to the Rev. Mr. Brown, however, a
small quantity has been found in the quartz of Yoruba, north of
Abeokuta; but, as in the Brazil, it is probably too much dispersed
to be worth working. And the Niger, which flows, as will presently
be seen, from the true auriferous centre, has at times been found to
roll down-stream gold.<a name="FNanchor_33_141" id="FNanchor_33_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_141" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>"The soil of Fante-land and the seaboard is, as has been seen,
but slightly auriferous.</p>

<p>"As we advance northwards from the Gold Coast the yield
becomes richer. In Ashanti the red and loamy soil, scattered with
gravel and grey granite, is everywhere impregnated with gold, which
the slaves extract by washing and digging. It is said that in the
market-place of Kumasi there are sixteen hundred ounces' worth
of gold&mdash;a treasure reserved for State purposes. The bracelets
of rock-gold, which the caboceers wear on State occasions, are four
pounds in weight, and often so heavy that they must rest their arms
upon the heads of their slave-boys.</p>

<p>"In Gyaman, the region to the north-west of the capital, the ore
is found in large nuggets, sometimes weighing four pounds. The
pits are sunk nine feet in the red granite and grey granite, and the
gold is highly coloured. From eight to ten thousand slaves work
for two months every year in the bed of the Barra river. There,
however, as on the Gold Coast, the work is very imperfect, and in
some places where the metal is sacred to the fetish, it is not worked
at all. Judging from analogy, we might expect to find the precious
metal in the declivities inland and northwards from Cape Palmas,
and in that sister formation of the East African ghauts, the 'Sierra
dol Crystal.' The late Captain Lawlin, an American trader settled
on an island at the mouth of the Fernão Vaz, carried to his own
country, about the year 1843-44, a quantity of granular gold, which
had been brought to him by some country-people. He brought back
all the necessary tools and implements to the Gaboon river, but
the natives became alarmed, and he failed to find the spot. Finally,
according to the tradition of native travellers, the unexplored region
called Rúmá,<a name="FNanchor_34_142" id="FNanchor_34_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_142" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and conjecturally placed south of the inhospitable
Waday, is a land of goldsmiths, the ore being found in mountainous
and well-watered districts. It is becoming evident that Africa will
some day equal half a dozen Californias.</p>

<p>"Mungo Park supplies the amplest notices of gold in the regions
visited by him north of the Kong Mountains. The principal places
are the head of the Senegal river and its various influents; Dindiko,
where the shafts are most deep, and notched, like a ladder; Seronda,
which gives two grains from every pound of alluvial matter;<a name="FNanchor_35_143" id="FNanchor_35_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_143" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Bambuk
and Bambarra. In Kongkadu, the 'mountain land,' where the
hills are of coarse riddy granite, composed of red feldspar, white
quartz, and black shale, containing orbicular concretions, granular
gold is found in the quartz, which is broken with hammers; the
grains, however, are flat. The diggings at present best known are
those of Mandina-land. The gold, we are told, is found not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
mines or veins, but scattered in sand and clay. They vary from
a pin's head to the size of a pea, and are remarkably pure. This is
called <i>sana manko</i>, or gold-powder, in contradistinction to <i>sana birro</i>,
or gold-stones&mdash;nuggets occasionally weighing five drachms. In
December, after the harvest home, when the gold-bearing <i>fiumaras</i>
from the hills have shrunk, the Mansa or Shaykh appoints a day to
begin <i>sana ku</i>&mdash;gold washing.</p>

<p>"Each woman arms herself with a hoe, two or three calabashes,
and a few quills. On the morning before departure a bullock is
slaughtered for a feast, and prayers and charms are not forgotten.
The error made by these people is digging and washing for years
in the same spot, which proves comparatively unfruitful unless the
torrent shifts its course. They never follow the lead to the hills, but
content themselves with exploring the heads of the watercourse, which
the rapid stream denudes of sand and clay, leaving a strew of small
pebbles that wear the skin off the finger-tips. The richest yield is
from pits sunk in the height of the dry season, near some hill in
which gold has been found. As the workers dig through the several
strata of sand and clay, they send up a few calabashes by way of
experiment for the women, whose peculiar duty it is to wash the
stuff, and thus they continue till they strike the floor-rock. The most
hopeful formation is held to be a bed of reddish sand, with small dark
specks, described as 'black matter, resembling gunpowder,' and called
by the people <i>sana mira</i>, or gold-rust; it is probably titeria. In
Murray's edition of 1816, there are illustrations of the various positions,
and a long description (vol. i. p. 450, and vol. ii. p. 75) of the
style of panning. I will not trouble the reader with it, as it in no way
differs from that now practised on the Gold Coast and Kafirlands.
There is art in this apparently simple process. Some women find
gold when others cannot discover a particle; and as quicksilver is
not used, at least one-third must be wasted, or rather, I may say, it
is preserved for a better day.</p>

<p>"The gold dust is stored in quills, stopped with cotton, and the
washers are fond of wearing a number of these trophies in their hair.
The average of an industrious individual's annual collection may be
two slaves. The price of these varies from nine to twelve <i>mankali</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36_144" id="FNanchor_36_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_144" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
each of 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or its equivalent in goods, viz. eighteen gun-flints,
forty-eight leaves of tobacco, twenty charges of gunpowder, a cutlass,
and a musket. Part of the gold is converted into massive and cumbrous
ornaments, necklaces, and earrings, and when a lady of consequence
is in full dress, she bears from £50 to £80. A proportion
is put by to defray expenses of travelling to and from the coast, and
the greater part is then invested in goods, or exchanged with the
Moors for salt and merchandise.</p>

<p>"The gold is weighed in small balances, which the people always
carry about with them, and they make, like the Hindus, but little
difference between gold dust and wrought gold. The purchaser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
always uses his own <i>tilikissi</i>, beans, probably, of the Abrus, which
are sometimes soaked in Shea butter, to increase their weight, or are
imitated with ground-down pebbles. In smelting gold, the smith
uses an alkaline salt, obtained from a ley of burnt corn-stalks. He
is capable, as even the wildest African tribes are, of drawing fine
wire. When rings&mdash;the favourite form in which the precious metal
is carried coastward&mdash;are to be made, the gold is run without any
flux in a crucible of sun-dried red clay, which is covered over with
charcoal or braize. The smith pours the fluid into a furrow traced
in the ground, by way of mould. When it has cooled, he reheats it,
and hammers it into a little square ingot or bar of the size required.
After a third exposure to fire he twists with his pincers the bar into
a screw shape, lengthens out the ends, and turns them up to form a
circle.</p>

<p>"It must now be abundantly evident to the reader, that the great
centre of West African gold, the source which supplies Manding to
the north and Ashanti to the south, is the equatorial range called
the Kong. What the mineral wealth must be there, it is impossible
to estimate, when nearly three millions and a half of pounds sterling
have usually been drawn from a small parallelogram, between its
southern slopes and the ocean, whilst the other three-quarters of the
land&mdash;without alluding to the equally rich declivities of the northern
versant&mdash;have remained as yet unexplored. Even in northern
Liberia, colonists have occasionally come upon a pocket of $50,
and the natives bring gold in from the banks of streams.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson<a name="FNanchor_37_145" id="FNanchor_37_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_145" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> remarks upon this subject, 'It is best for whites
and blacks that these mines should be worked just as they are. The
world is not suffering for the want of gold, and the comparative
small quantities that are brought to the sea-coast keep the people
in continual intercourse with civilized men, and ultimately, no
doubt, will be the means of introducing civilization and Christianity
among them.'</p>

<p>"I differ from the reverend author, <i>toto cœlo</i>. For such vain
hope as that of improving Africans by European intercourse, and for
all considerations of an 'ultimately' vaguer than the sweet singer of
Israel's 'soon,' it is regrettable that active measures for exploitation
are not substituted. And if the world, including the reverend gentleman
and Lord John Russell, are not suffering for the want of gold,
there are those, myself for instance, and many a better man, who
would be happy at times to see and to feel a little more of that 'vile
yellow clay.'"</p></blockquote>

considering the date of its publication, 1825) truly says, that the spirit of Christianity
tends to abolish servitude is clear, that it admits of servitude is even still
clearer. The Authorized Version of the Bible, like the Constitution of the United
States, very prudently shirks the word 'slave,' and translates by 'servants' the
δοῡλοι [Greek: douloi], or bondsmen, whom St. Paul enjoins to be subject to their κυρίοι [Greek: kourioi], or
masters, and elsewhere δοῡλος [Greek: doulos], a chattel, is opposed to ἐλεύθερος [Greek: eleutheros], a freeman.

gold, which they carried before his Highness the Gaikwar, and received in return
a terrible flogging. The Hindú, with that secretiveness which has ever been his

his good fortune to himself. The quality of gold which from time to time has

means master, sir, <i>kyrios</i>, etc.), and 'Mtapa,' the proper name of the chief. The

Zambeze and the Limpopo rivers, 7° from north to south. The African traveller,
however, is not so successful in explaining the corrupted term, Monomoizes,

M'nyamwezi, a man or individual of the land Unyamwezi?"</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;<i>To a Husband during a Long Absence.</i></span><br />
<br /></p>


<p>Richard left me plenty of occupation during this awfully long
absence of sixteen months. Firstly, all kinds of official fights about
India, and then for a gunboat and other privileges for Fernando
Po. I lived with my father, mother, and family, and then I had a
great deal to do for his book, "The City of the Saints," and every
letter brought its own work and commissions, people to see and
to write to, and things to be done for him, so that I was never idle
for a minute. I began to feel, what I have always felt since, that he
was the glorious, stately ship in full sail, commanding all attention
and admiration; and sometimes, if the wind drops, she still sails
gallantly, and no one sees the humble little steam-tug hidden at the
other side, with her strong heart and faithful arms working forth, and
glorying in her proud and stately ship.</p>

<p>I think a true woman, who is married to her proper mate, recognizes
the fully performed mission, whether prosperous or not, and
that no one can ever take his place <i>for her</i>, as an interpreter of that
which is betwixt her and her Creator, <i>to her</i> as the shadow of God's
protection here on earth.</p>

<p>In winter he made me go to Paris with the Napoleon ring and
sketch, mentioned in the little story called "The Last Hours of
Napoleon;" and, through want of experience and proper friends
and protection, my little mission of courtesy failed. The failure drew
down upon me some annoyances, which appeared very disagreeable
and important to me at the time; they are not worth mentioning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
nor, indeed, had I been older and more experienced, should I have
thought them worth fretting about.</p>

<p>The rest of the time of those dreary sixteen months was wearing
to a degree, and diversified by ten weeks of diphtheria and its results.
One day I betook myself to the Foreign Office, and I cried my heart
out to Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Layard. He seemed very sorry
for me, and he asked me to wait awhile whilst he went upstairs; and,
when he came back, he told me that he had got four months' leave
home for my husband, and had ordered the despatch to be sent off
that very afternoon. I could have thrown my arms round his neck
and kissed him, but I did not; he might have been rather surprised.
I had to go and sit out in the Green Park till the excitement wore
off; it was more to me than if he had given me a large fortune.</p>

<p>At last the happy day came to go and meet Richard at Liverpool,
and I shall never forget the joy of our meeting. It was December,
1863, and we had some happy weeks in England&mdash;a pleasant Christmas
with my people at Wardour, and at Lord Gerard's at Garswood,
where the family parties mustered strong, and at Fryston (Lord
Houghton's), and several other country-houses; and he brought out
two books&mdash;"Wanderings in West Africa" (2 vols., 1863), also
"Abeokuta and the Cameroons" (2 vols., 1863), which he dedicated
to me, with a lovely inscription and motto, of which I am
very proud. And then came round the time again to leave. But
I told him I could not possibly go on living as I was living; it was
too miserable, one's husband in a place where one was not allowed
to go, and I living with my mother like a girl&mdash;I was neither wife, nor
maid, nor widow; so he took me with him. Excepting yachting, it
was my first experience of <i>real</i> sea-going.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_sail_for_West_Africa"></a>We sail for West Africa.</i></div>

<p>The African steamships were established in January, 1852, by the
late Mr. MacGregor Laird, who was the second pioneer of the Niger
Exploration, and an enthusiastic improver of Africa. These steamers
were seven in number, and went once a month; four of them were of
978 tons. They went out to the West Coast, Fernando Po being
their furthest station save one, and the whole round from England
and back again caused them to visit twenty-two ports, and cover
ten thousand nautical miles at eight knots an hour; but they were
built for cargo, not for passengers. There was no doctor, no bath;
the conveniences were difficult, and the stewardess only went as
far as Madeira, the first port. We sometimes had seven or eight
human beings stuffed into a cabin, which had four berths. I speak
of 1861-2-3-4; it may be all changed since then. We now started in
the worst circumstances. It was the big storm of January, 1863, one
of the worst that has ever been known. My mother, who was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
bad sailor, insisted on coming on board to see us off. It was terribly
rough, and an ironclad just shaved us going out, as we lay to in the
river. There were even wrecks in the Mersey. Our Captain frankly said
that he had an accident every January, but he would almost rather
sink than have a mark put against his name for not going out on his
right day. Mother behaved most pluckily. She went back in the
tug, and she just reached Uncle Gerard's, which was three-quarters of
an hour from Liverpool, got up to her bedroom, took up the poker
to poke the fire, which fell out of her hand&mdash;she had the strength to
crawl to the bell&mdash;and when they came up she was on the floor in
that attack of paralysis with which she had been so long threatened,
and to stave off which, we had hid my marriage from her just two
years before.</p>

<p>Long before we had got past the Skerries, we were in serious
trouble, and the passengers implored the Captain to alter his course,
and take refuge in some harbour; but he explained to them that it
would be awfully dangerous to turn the ship's head round, as the
going round might sink her. I had forgotten in my ignorance to
secure a berth, and the Captain gallantly gave up his own cabin to
me, till Madeira. It was just on the break of the poop, and every
wave broke over that before it reached the saloon. The ship
appeared quite unmanageable; she bucked and plunged without
stopping. There were seven feet of water in the hold, and all
hands and available passengers were called on to man the pumps.
The under berths were full of water, the bird-cages and kittens and
parcels were all floating about, most of the women were screaming,
many of the men-passengers were drunk, the lights went out, the
furniture came unshipped and rolled about at its own sweet will.
The cook was thrown on the galley fire, so there could be
nothing to eat. Fortunately the sea put the fire out. It was very
difficult for men to get along the deck.</p>

<p>A rich lady gave the stewardess £5 to hold her hand all night,
so the rest of us poorer ones had to do without consolation. One
most painful scene occurred. There were seven women, missionaries'
wives, going out either with or to join their husbands. One,
a poor child of sixteen, just married, missed her husband, and she
called out in the dark for him. A naval officer who was going out
to join his ship, and was tipsy the whole way, called out, "Oh, he
has tumbled overboard, and is hanging on outside; you will never
see him any more." The poor child believed it, and fell down in
an epileptic fit, to which she remained subject as long as I ever
heard of her. Her husband and mine were working at the pumps.
I crawled to my bunk in the Captain's cabin, sick and terrified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
and I thought that the terrible seas breaking against its side were
loosening the nails, and that the sea would come in and wash me
out. I was far away from any help and quite alone, and I hung on
to the door, calling, "Carpenter! carpenter!" He came to my
assistance, but a huge wave covered us; it carried him overboard
and left me&mdash;he was never seen again. We lost two men that night.</p>

<p>As I lay there trembling, and terribly sea-sick, something tumbled
against my door, and rolled in and sank down on the floor. It was
the tipsy naval officer. I could not rise, I could not shut the door,
I could not lug him out, so I lay there. When Richard had
finished his work, he crawled along the decks till he got to the cabin,
where the sea had swamped through the open door pretty considerably.
"Hullo! what's that?" he said. I managed faintly to
ejaculate, "The tipsy naval officer." He picked him up by the
scruff of his neck, and, regardless of consequences, he propelled
him, with a good kick behind, all down the deck, and shut the
door. He said, "The Captain says we can't live more than two
hours in such a sea as this." At first I was frightened that I should
die, but now I was only frightened that I shouldn't, and I uttered
feebly, "Oh, thank God it will be over so soon." I shall never
forget how angry he was with me, because I was not frightened, and
gave me quite a sermon. We were like that mostly three days and
nights, and then it got better, and I saw the steward passing with
some boiled mutton and caper sauce, and called out, "Oh, stop and
give me some." He cut me some slices, and I ate them like a
starved dog. I got up and dressed and went on deck, and have
never been sea-sick since to speak of. I do not speak of Richard,
because he never was sea-sick in his life; he never knew what it was;
and I believe if it had not been for spilling the ink, he would have
been writing his manuscripts, even if the ship had been going round
like a squirrel's cage, as he always did all his life, no matter what the
weather, and ate and slept enough for three.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_land_at_Madeira"></a>We land at Madeira.</i></div>

<p>The temperature changed by magic. There was a tropical calm
at night; the usual rough north-easterly breeze of the outside subsided
into a luxurious, sensual calm, with occasional puffs of soft,
exciting westerly zephyrs, or <i>viento de las mugeres</i>, formed by the
land wind of the night. We arrived in thirteen days at Madeira,
having been longer than usual on account of the three days' storm.
We could smell the land strong of clover hay long before we reached
it. I shall never forget my astonishment and delight when I looked
out of the port-hole one morning and found myself at Madeira.
We had left a frightful English winter, we had suffered much on
the sea journey; here was summer&mdash;luxuriant and varied foliage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
warmth and splendour, the profusion and magnificence of the
tropics, a bright blue sky and sun, a deep blue sea, mountains, hills
covered with vines, white villas covered with glorious creepers, and
picturesque churches and convents. Here we passed a most delightful
six weeks. At that time, for about £200 a year, one could
have all the luxuries that one could desire&mdash;ponies to ride, a hammock
to carry you, boats to sail in, and every comfort and luxury;
and as for hospitality, there was hardly a chance of breakfasting,
lunching, or dining at home. We found here our best and never-to-be-forgotten
friend, Lady Marian Alford, with the first Lord
Brownlow, Dr. Frank, and a large party whose society we daily
enjoyed immensely. After some weeks we went on to Teneriffe in
another West African boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Yellow_Fever"></a>Yellow Fever.</i></div>

<p>When we arrived at Santa Cruz, in Teneriffe, I did not think much
of it; it is not only far less pretty than Madeira, but there were no
comforts and luxuries. <i>En revanche</i>, it was far healthier, because
Madeira, like Davosplatz, had been quite used up by consumptives,
and was full of germs; but then we had arrived at a wrong moment,
as we found that the yellow fever was raging at Santa Cruz, and
whilst we were there it carried off three thousand people in as
many weeks. There was such a panic, that the moment a person
was ill, the coffin was brought in and put under the bed, by way of
reassuring the patient, and the moment they got into the state of
coma, in which they either die or recover, they were clapped into
their coffins, but not locked down, and the key was handed to the
nearest relative, and the coffin was put into the ground with only
a small quantity of mould over it, so that when the patient came
to, and was strong enough, he or she would struggle out and come
home.</p>

<p>One woman came back in her graveclothes, and tapped at
her cottage door, which, in those parts, opens into what serves as
a sitting-room. Her daughter was sitting at the table, by moonlight,
weeping for her mother's death, when the tap came; she got
up and opened the door, and saw her mother standing in her graveclothes!
Believing it to be her ghost, she fell down insensible.
The mother lived for many years, and had more children, but the
daughter never recovered her reason. One gentlemen, whom we
knew, took it at nine in the morning. We went to inquire after
him, and was told he was convalescent, and at eleven, two hours
later, we saw his funeral going down the street! English people
born at Teneriffe have such an emaciated appearance that I
was always condoling with them on having had the yellow fever;
and then, to my horror, I found it was their natural appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Richard and I thought it better to move, and not waiting for our
baggage, things being at the worst, and transport difficult, we set
off with knapsacks to walk across the island, twenty-one miles, to
Oratava, where we heard that not a single case had made its appearance.
There was a halfway house, a very poor little inn. We
slept there. Our room was shaped like a claret-case, white-washed,
with a tiny grating near the roof for air. There was no furniture
of any kind, but they put a mattress on the floor, and gave us
a rug. We lay down in our clothes, taking off our weapons and
laying them between us. When we woke in the morning, and got
up, intending to breakfast and continue our tramp, we found that
although we had closed the door, and stuck something up against
it, so that any one coming in would knock it down and make a noise,
that some one had stolen our best knife, from between us, and we
were both remarkably light sleepers. A Spaniard cannot resist
a knife, and as everything remained exactly as we had left it, it
showed that there was some trap-door, or panel in the wall for
ingress, which was not perceptible.</p>

<p>It was not comfortable, so we were not sorry to be once more
upon the road. We arrived at Oratava, and found it delightful.
In our days (1863) there were no hotels; but we were able to hire
a room, the size of a riding-school, in a private house on the Square.
One side was our bedroom, one corner our dressing-room, one our
drawing-room and dining-room, and the middle our study.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Peak_of_Teneriffe"></a>The Peak of Teneriffe.</i></div>

<p>Whilst here (March, 1863) we made a delightful excursion up the
Peak of Teneriffe. We were out two days and one night. The Peak
is 12,198 feet above sea-level. We bivouacked in the snow at 9600
feet, and slept well. Temp., 16°. Around us were no end of
little spirts of steam; we counted thirty-five on the final cone. The
view from the top, as the dawn broke, was glorious. The horses
slept lower down, further ascent being too steep, and the most
distressing thing was that they could have no water. The mules
could eat snow, but they could not; and coming into the town, they
flew at everybody with water-jars on their heads. At last they
heard the trickling of the stream near the little town, and they
bolted at full gallop. We drew rein, jumped down, and loosened
their girths, and let them drink. The only peculiarity of our journey
was that it was the <i>first</i> performed in <i>winter</i>, and therefore people
were anxious about us.</p>

<p>The women of Teneriffe were the most beautiful I have ever seen&mdash;a
cross between Spanish and Irish, who were shipwrecked here in
old times. I used to stop and stare at them until they used to say,
"What are you staring at?" and I would answer, "At you, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
you are so pretty;" and they used to laugh with delight, and show
the most lovely teeth. I allude to the peasant women, whose Spanish
is very pretty, but not quite Castilian. Here I wrote my first book
on Madeira and Teneriffe; but my husband would not let me print
it, because he did not think it was up to the mark. He thought
I must study and copy many more years before I tried authorship.
And he was right, both in this and not letting me share with
him the climate of West Africa. But I thought both very hard at
the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_return_Home"></a>I return Home.</i></div>

<p>The time came when he had to go back to his post, but I was
not allowed to <i>sleep</i> at Fernando Po. I thought it dreadfully hard,
and cried and begged, but he was immovable; and he was right.
So I turned back again with a heavy heart, and had a passage
back, if not quite as bad, very nearly as bad, <i>viâ</i> Teneriffe and
Madeira. Being alone, I had gone into the ladies' cabin&mdash;a very
small hole with four berths, and what is called by courtesy a sofa;
but there were eight of us packed in it. It was pitch dark; the porthole
being closed on account of the weather, the effluvia was disgusting.
I got on a dressing-gown, and crawled out to a stack of
arms, which I fondly embraced, to keep myself from rolling overboard,
where I was found by one of the officers, who ran off to the
Captain; he found there was an empty deck cabin, which they
immediately put me into, and in a few hours, having got rid
of the noxious vapours, I quite recovered. I again passed a long
and dreary time, during which he kept me either with my parents
well at work, or at sea coming out and going back, with visits to
Madeira and Teneriffe. I had one <i>very</i> anxious time, inasmuch as
he was sent as her Majesty's Commissioner to the King of Dahomè,
in <i>those days</i> by no means a safe or easy thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_sent_as_HMs_Commissioner_to_Dahome"></a>Richard sent as H.M.'s Commissioner to Dahomè.</i></div>

<p>Richard, being British Consul for Fernando Po, went to visit
Agbome, the capital of the kingdom of Dahomè. Lord Russell, hearing
of this, gave him instructions to proceed as her Majesty's Commissioner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
on a friendly mission to King Gelele, to impress upon the
King the importance the British Government attached to the cessation
of the slave-trade, and to endeavour by every possible means to
induce him to cease to continue the Dahoman customs. Now the
Dahoman customs, as all know, meant the cutting of the throats
of prisoners of war, and, in old days, making a little lake of blood
on which to sail a boat. Not only this, cruelty was the rule of every
day. Throats cut, to send a message to the king's father in the
other world; women cut open alive in a state of pregnancy to see
what it was like; animals tied up in every sort of horrible position.
He writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is apparently in this people a physical delight in cruelty
to beasts as well as to men. The sight of suffering seems to bring
them enjoyment, without which the world is tame. Probably the
wholesale murderers and torturers of history, from Phalaris and Nero
downwards, took an animal and sensual pleasure&mdash;all the passions
are sisters&mdash;in the look of blood, and in the inspection of mortal
agonies. I can see no other explanation of the phenomena which
meets my eye in Africa. In almost all the towns on the Oil Rivers,
you see dead or dying animals fastened in some agonizing position.
Poultry is most common, because cheapest&mdash;eggs and milk are <i>juju</i>
to slaves here&mdash;they are tied by the legs, head downwards, or lashed
round the body to a stake or a tree, where they remain till they fall
in fragments. If a man be unwell he hangs a live chicken round his
throat, expecting that its pain will abstract from his sufferings.
Goats are lashed head downwards tightly to wooden pillars, and are
allowed to die a lingering death. Even the harmless tortoise cannot
escape impalement. Blood seems to be the favourite ornament for
a man's face, as pattern-painting with some dark colour, like indigo,
is the proper decoration for a woman. At funerals, numbers of
goats and poultry are sacrificed for the benefit of the deceased, and
the corpse is sprinkled with the warm blood. The headless trunks
are laid upon the body, and if the fowls flap their wings, which they
will do for some seconds after decapitation, it is a good omen for the
dead man.</p>

<p>"When male prisoners of war are taken they are brought home for
sacrifice and food, whilst their infants and children are sometimes
supported by the middle, from poles planted in the canoe. The
priest decapitates the men&mdash;for ordinary executions each Chief has
his own headsman&mdash;and no one doubts that the bodies are eaten.
Mr. Smith and Dr. Hutchinson both aver that they witnessed actual
cases. The former declares that, when old Pepple, father of the
present King, took captive King Amakree, of New Calabar, he gave
a large feast to the European slave-traders on the river. All was on
a grand scale. But the reader might perhaps find some difficulty in
guessing the name of the dish placed before his Majesty at the head
of the table. It was the bloody heart of the King of Calabar, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
as it had been torn from the body. He took it in his hand and
devoured it with the greatest apparent gusto, remarking, 'This is
the way I serve my enemies!'</p>

<p>"Shortly after my first visit, five prisoners of war were brought in
from the eastern country. I saw in the <i>juju</i>-house their skulls, which
were suspiciously white and clean, as if boiled, and not a white man
doubted that they had been eaten. The fact is, that they cannot
afford to reject any kind of provisions."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard was the bearer of presents from Her Majesty to the King&mdash;one
forty-feet circular crimson silk damask tent, with pole complete;
a richly embossed silver pipe with amber mouthpiece; two richly
embossed silver belts, with lion and crane in raised relief; two silver
waiters; one coat of mail and gauntlets. This is not the place to
introduce the subject very largely into <i>this</i> book, as I hope to do
in "The Labours and Wisdom of Richard Burton" (two further
volumes that I am preparing). But I may say that, with regard to
his Mission, the King said that if he renounced the customs of his
forefathers his people would kill him; that the slaves represented his
fortune, but if the Queen would allow him £50,000 a year, that he
would be able to do without it. With regard to the tent, it was
exceedingly handsome, but it was too small to sit under in that
climate, and the only thing he cared for was the gingerbread lion
on the top of the pole. He liked his old red-clay and wooden-stem
pipe better than the silver one; he liked the silver waiters very
much, but he thought they were too small to use as shields; he
could not get his hand into the gauntlet; the coat of mail he hung
up and made into a target; and then he explained that the only
thing he really <i>did</i> want, and would be much obliged to her
Majesty for, was a carriage and horses, and a white woman!</p>

<p class="capt">THE CHIEF OFFICER OF RICHARD'S BRIGADE OF AMAZONS.
<i>Sketched by himself.</i></p>
</div>

<p>He made my husband a Brigadier-General of his Amazons, and I
was madly jealous from afar; for I imagined lovely women in flowing
robes, armed, and riding thoroughbred Arabs, and above is the
Amazon as, to my great relief, I found she was (afterwards). The
King gave him a string of green beads, which was a kind of Dahoman
"Garter," a necklace of human bones for his favourite squaw, and
a silver chain and Cross with a Chameleon on it. We traced in
it the presence of former missionaries, who doubtless found that
their crucifixes were thought to be a delightful invention for the
King to crucify men, and therefore they replaced it by the chameleon.
I have lost my paper on it, and am afraid to quote Greek
without it. The King sent return presents to Her Majesty; they
consisted of native pipes and tobacco for Her Majesty's smoking,
and loin-cloths for Her Majesty to change while travelling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
an umbrella to be held over Her Majesty's head whilst drinking.
The presents arrived one day whilst I was at the Foreign Office,
but as there had been a murder at Fernando Po, and Richard
had been ordered to send home the clothes of the murdered man,
on opening the box they were supposed to be these latter articles,
and were put on one side. I was told they looked quite dirty
enough to be that.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Dahome_and_Richards_Travels"></a>Dahomè and Richard's Travels.</i></div>

<p>The journey occupied three months, during the whole of which
time the King made much of him, but holding his life in his
hand, and any spiteful moment might have ended it. He told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
me when he came back, that he had seen enough horrid sights
to turn a man's brain; and he said, "I used to have to be perfectly
calm and dignified whilst seeing these things, or they would
have had a contempt for me; but I frequently used to send to
the King to say, that if such or such happened again, I should be
obliged to leave his Court, as my Government did not countenance
such proceedings, which always had the desired effect." On
his return, he received no acknowledgment whatever of his services,
but Earl Russell wrote me a kind little note, in which he said, "Tell
Captain Burton that he has performed his Mission to my utmost
and entire satisfaction." I will renew the subject, as I said, in my
"Labours and Wisdom of Richard Burton."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Travels_Business_etc_on_the_West_Coast"></a>His Travels, Business, etc. on the West Coast.</i></div>

<p>The Bight of Biafra, on the West Coast of Africa, extends from
Fernando Po to Bathurst, about six hundred miles of coast, and that
was Richard's jurisdiction. The lawless conduct of the rum-corrupted
natives gave him a good deal of trouble. The traders and
the merchants of the coast are called "palm-oil lambs," and they
used to call Richard their "shepherd" (supercargoes and skippers
are also called "palm-oil ruffians" and "coast-lambs"). I believe
he managed them very amicably, and, in spite of business and the
dangerous climate, he was supported by all the better class of
European agents and supercargoes. He pursued his explorations
with ardour. He knew the whole coast from Bathurst (Gambia)
to St. Paulo de Loanda (Angola). He marched up to Abeokuta, he
ascended the Cameroon Mountains,<a name="FNanchor_1_146" id="FNanchor_1_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_146" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the wonderful extinct volcano
described by Hanno the Carthagenian and Ptolemy's "Theon
Ochema." He wanted the English Government to establish a
sanitarium there for the West Coast, and a convict-station for garrotters,
the last new crime of <i>that</i> day, and to be allowed to use them
to construct roads, and in cultivating cotton and chocolate. He
told Lord Russell that he would be responsible for them, and should
never chain them or lock them up, because, as long as they remained
within a certain extent of ring-fence, they would be well and hearty,
and the moment they went outside it, they would die without anybody
looking after them. The British Government was too tender
over their darling human brutes, the cruel, ferocious, and murderous
criminals, though the climate was considered quite good enough for
Richard and other honourable and active British subjects. He then
told Earl Russell that if he would make him Governor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
"Gold Coast," he could send home annually one million pounds
sterling; but Lord Russell answered him, "that gold was becoming
too common."</p>

<p>He then visited the cannibal Mpangwe, the Fans of Du Chaillu,
whose accuracy he had always stood up for when the world had
doubted him, and now he was able to confirm it. He then went to
Benin City, which was mostly unknown to the Europeans. Belzoni
was born in Padua in 1778. During the last eight years of his life
he was an African explorer; and he died in Africa, at Benin, in
1823, and he was buried at Gwato, at the foot of a very large tree;
guns were fired, and a carpenter from one of the ships put up a
tablet to his memory. It is suspected that he was poisoned for the
sake of plunder. It was said that some native had inherited his
papers. Richard offered £20 for them, but without avail. Belzoni's
tree is of a fine spreading growth, which bears a poison apple, and
whose boughs droop nearly to the ground. It is a pretty and
romantic spot. He writes, "I made an attempt at digging, in
order that I might take home his bones and, if possible, his papers,
but I was obliged to content myself with sketching his tree, and
sending home a handful of wild-flowers to Padua. He died, some
say, on the 26th of November, and some say the 3rd of December,
1820." It is remarkable the tender feeling that Richard had for
Travellers' graves abroad; indeed, <i>any</i> English graves abroad, but
especially Travellers or Englishmen. The number of graves that we
have sought out, and put in a state of repair and furnished with
tombstones and flowers, you would hardly believe&mdash;Lady Hester
Stanhope's in Syria, Jules Jaquemont's in Bombay, a French
traveller, and many, many others. It showed the feeling that he had
about a traveller coming home to lay his bones to rest in his own
land, and the respect he had for their resting-place. It makes me
all the more thankful that I was able to bring <i>him</i> home to the
place he chose himself, and that our friends enabled me to put up
such a monument to him.</p>

<p>He brought out, in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, several letters in February,
March, and April, 1863, previous to his "Wanderings." He ascended
the Elephant Mountain, and when he came home he lectured upon
that before the Geographical Society. I remember so well, when
Richard had submitted something he had written to Norton Shaw,
at the Royal Geographical Society, the latter saying, "I don't
ever remember hearing this word before, Burton! Where does it
come from?" He threw back his head and laughed. "I coined
it myself of course, and who has a better right?" Norton Shaw
laughed heartily. "Well," he said, "it is a good word, a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
word." "Oh!" said Richard, "I always coin one when I have
not got one; it is the only way." He visited the line of lagoons
between Lagos and the Volta river. He explored the Yellahlah
rapids of the Congo river, and while engaged in all this he collected
2859 proverbs in different African tongues, as for example the Wolof
tongue, Kanuri or Bornuese, the Oji or Ashanti, the Ga or Accra,
the Yoruba; some from the Eun or Dahoman; some from the Isubú,
and Dúalla, of the Bight of Biafra; some in the Efik of the Old
Calabar river, also Bight of Biafra; some from the Fans or Mpangwe,
from the Upper Gaboon river. He held that the object of language-study
was to obtain an insight into the character and thought-modes
of Mankind, and that it was not only necessary to speak their
language, but to investigate their literary compositions.</p>

<p>He thought that in the Semitic dialects, and in other Asiatic and
Indo-European tongues&mdash;as the Persian, which imitate their style&mdash;the
habit of balancing sentences naturally produces this parallelism,
and he believed that "The Thousand and One Nights" supplies as
many instances as can be found in the Hebrew poets. He thought
that the whole of Yoruba shows more or less the effects of El Islam.
With respect to the Kafirs, he says it must be noticed that they are
a mixed race of African, Arab, and perhaps Persian blood. He
thought that a collection of proverbs of this sort would make a kind
of manual of Asiatic thought. The nations of the East, he said,
always delight in the significant brevity of aphoristic eloquence; and
the Proverbs of Solomon show their antiquity and their extensive
uses by the Jews. The Arabs were equally addicted to proverbs,
which passed into the Persian and Indian languages. He therefore
produced "Wit and Wisdom from West Africa; or, a Book of Proverbial
Philosophy, Idioms, Enigmas, and Laconisms," in 1865,
in 1 vol., and his "Mission to Gelele, King of Dahomè" (2 vols.,
1864), which should be <i>now</i> a very useful book to the French army,
as his "First Footsteps in East Africa" or "Harar" should be to
the Italians.</p>

<h4>HOME.</h4>


<p>At last the time came round for a second leave, and we had a
second joyous meeting at Liverpool&mdash;this time to part no more as
previously. It was on the 28th of August, soon after his landing,
1864, that we chose our burial-place in the Mortlake Cemetery.
We had been for that purpose to one of the big cemeteries&mdash;I think
it was Kensal Green&mdash;and we had seen with discomfort that there
was so much damp, and looking into an open grave we saw it was
full of water; so he looked round rather woeful, and instead of
saying it was melancholy, as most men would have done, and as <i>I
thought</i>, he espied a tomb on which the instruments of the Passion
were represented, amongst them the cock of St. Peter. So he said,
"I don't think we had better be too near that cock, he will always
be crowing and waking us up." We were on a visit to my aunts at
Mortlake, who had bought Portobello House, close to the station,
nearly opposite to where I live now, had been settled there for
some years, and where we had had many large family reunions.
We walked into the burial-ground where numbers of my people are
buried, and he said, "We will have it here; it is like a nice little
family hotel;" and he again confirmed the idea in 1882, when we
came down to visit my mother's grave.</p>

<p>Whilst Richard had been on the West Coast of Africa, Speke
and Grant had been on their Expedition, and returned and had a
grand ovation. The labours of the <i>first</i> Expedition had rendered
the road easy for the <i>second</i>. "The line had been opened," Richard
wrote, "by me to Englishmen; they had only to tread in my steps."
In the closing days of December, 1863, Speke made a speech at
Taunton, which for vain-gloriousness and bad taste was unequalled.
He referred to Richard as "Bigg," asserted "that in 1857 he (Speke)
had hit the Nile on the head, but that now (1863) he had driven it
into the Mediterranean." It is not much to be wondered at if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
following epigram on one of Richard's visiting cards was left on the
table of the Royal Geographical Society&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Two loves the Row of Savile haunt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Who both by nature big be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fool is Colonel (Barren) Grant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The rogue is General Rigby."</span><br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Spekes_Death"></a>Speke's Death.</i></div>

<p>The first great event was the British Association Meeting at
Bath, September, 1864. Laurence Oliphant conveyed to Richard
that Speke had said that "if Burton appeared on the platform at
Bath" (which was, as it were, Speke's native town) "he would kick
him." I remember Richard's answer&mdash;"Well, <i>that</i> settles it! By
God, he <i>shall</i> kick me;" and so to Bath we went. There was
to be no speaking on Africa the first day, but the next day was
fixed for the "great discussion between Burton and Speke." The
first day we went on the platform close to Speke. He looked at
Richard, and at me, and we at him. I shall never forget his face.
It was full of sorrow, of yearning, and perplexity. Then he seemed
to turn to stone. After a while he began to fidget a great deal, and
exclaimed half aloud, "Oh, I cannot stand this any longer." He
got up to go out. The man nearest him said, "Shall you want your
chair again, Sir? May I have it? Shall you come back?" and he
answered, "I hope not," and left the Hall. The next day a large
crowd was assembled for this famous discussion. All the distinguished
people were with the Council; Richard <i>alone was excluded</i>,
and stood on the platform, <i>we two alone</i>, he with his notes in his
hand. There was a delay of about twenty-five minutes, and then the
Council and speakers filed in and announced the terrible accident
out shooting that had befallen poor Speke shortly after his leaving
the Hall the day before. Richard sank into a chair, and I saw by the
workings of his face the terrible emotion he was controlling, and the
shock he had received. When called upon to speak, in a voice that
trembled, he spoke of other things and as briefly as he could. When
we got home he wept long and bitterly, and I was for many a day
trying to comfort him.</p>

<p>I reprint a few lines that rushed to my mind in winter, 1864:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The following lines were suggested to me in the studio of the late Edgar
George Papworth, Esq., of 36, Milton Street, Dorset Square, in the winter of
1864.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton had recently returned from Africa. The annual meeting of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science had just taken place at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Bath, and poor Captain Speke's sudden death was still fresh in our memories.
We had been invited by the artist to look at Captain Speke's bust, upon which
he was then employed. Mr. Papworth said to Captain Burton, 'I only took the
cast after death, and never knew him alive; but you who lived with him so long
can surely give me some hints.' Captain Burton, who had learnt something of
sculpturing when a boy in Italy, took the sculptor's pencil from Mr. Papworth's
hand, and with a few touches here and there made a perfect likeness and expression.
As I stood by, I was very much impressed by this singular coincidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Stone_Talk"></a>Richard's "Stone Talk."</i></div>

<p>Richard at this time wrote, secretly, a little "squib" of one
hundred and twenty-one pages, called "Stone Talk," being some of
the marvellous sayings of a petral portion of Fleet Street, London, to
one Dr. Polyglot, Ph.D., by Frank Baker, D.O.N., 1865. He kept it
quite secret from me, and one day brought it out of his pocket on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
railway journey, as if he had bought it from a stall, and gave it to me
to read. I was delighted with it, kept reading him out passages from
it, with peals of laughter. Fortunately we were alone, and I kept
saying to him, "Jemmy, I wish you would not go about talking as
you do; I am sure this man has been associating with you at the
club, picked up all your ideas and written this book, and won't he
just catch it!" At last, after going on like that for a considerable
time, the amused expression of his face flashed an idea into my
brain, and I said, "You wrote it yourself, Jemmy, and <i>nobody else</i>;"
and he said, "I <i>did</i>." When I showed it to Lord Houghton, he
told me that he was afraid that it would do Richard a great deal of
harm with the "powers that were," and advised me to buy them up,
which I did. He took the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Frank Baker" from
his second name Francis and his mother's name Baker.</p>

<p>It has been thrown in my teeth, since his death, that he would
have married twice before he married me, and as he was between
thirty-nine and forty at the time of our marriage, it is very natural
that it should be so. I sometimes take comfort in reading passages
from "Stone Talk" anent former loves&mdash;I do not know who
they are:&mdash;</p>

<p>This year, 1864, Richard edited and annotated Marcy's "Prairie
Traveller" for the <i>Anthropological Review</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Gaiety"></a>Gaiety.</i></div>

<p>Apart from the sad circumstance of Speke's death, we had a very
delightful winter. We went to Uncle Gerard's at Garswood, to Lady
Egerton of Tatton's, to Lady Stanley of Alderley's (in the present
dowager's time), when the now Dowager Lady Airlie and Lady
Amberly and all the family were then at home, where we met an
immense quantity of distinguished people, and notably Professor
Jowett. Then we went to Lady Margaret Beaumont's at Bretton Park,
and to Lord Fitzwilliam's; and all these had large house-parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Winwoode_Reade_We_go_to_Ireland"></a>Winwoode Reade&mdash;We go to Ireland.</i></div>

<p>This year we became very intimate with Winwood Reade. We
went over to Ireland, where we spent a delightful two months.
We took an Irish car, and drove by degrees over all the most
interesting and prettiest parts of Ireland, at the rate of so many
miles a day, stopping where it was most interesting. I had an Irish
maid with me, whose chief delight was to see Richard and me clinging
on to the car as it flew round the corners, while she sat as cool and
calm as possible, with her hands in her muff. "Ye devil," Richard
said to her, "I believe you were born on a car; I will pay you out
for laughing at me." Some days afterwards, she dropped her muff.
There was a great deal of snow on the ground, so Richard said to
her very kindly, "Don't get down, Kiernan; I will get your muff for
you." He stopped the car, got down, pretended to be very busy with
his boot, but in reality he was filling her muff with snow. When he
gave it back to her she gave a little screech. "Ah," he said, with
glistening eyes, "you'll laugh at me for clinging on the car like a
monkey on a scraper again."</p>

<p>We were asked to numbers of country-houses on the way&mdash;to the
Bellews', Gormanstons', and Lord Drogheda's; and we had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
pleasure of making acquaintance with Lady Rachel Butler and
Lord James, who were very kind to us. Dublin was immensely
hospitable, and at that time very gay. One of our interesting
events was making acquaintance with Mr. Lentaigne, the great
convict philanthropist. His mania was to reform his convicts, and
make his friends take them for service, if nobody else would. He
was the man to whom Lord Carlisle said, "Why, Lentaigne, you
will wake up some morning, and find you are the only spoon in
the house." He took us to see the prisons and the reformatories,
and he implored of me to take out with me a convict woman of
about thirty-four, who had been fifteen years in prison. I said,
"Well, Mr. Lentaigne, what did she do?" "Poor girl! the sweetest
creature&mdash;she murdered her baby when she was sixteen." "Well,"
I answered, "I would do anything to oblige you, but I dare say I
shall often be quite alone with her, and at thirty-four she might like
larger game."</p>

<p>Richard was veritably, though born of prosaic parents, a child
of romance. He had English, Irish, Scotch, and French blood in
his veins, and, it has often been suggested (though never proved),
a drop of Oriental or gypsy blood from some far-off ancestor. His
Scottish, North England, and Border blood came out in all posts of
trust and responsibility, in steadiness and coolness in the hour of
danger, in uprightness and integrity, and the honour of a gentleman.
Of Irish blood he showed nothing excepting fight, but the two
foreign strains were strong. From Arab or gypsy he got his fluency
of languages, his wild and daring spirit, his Agnosticism, his melancholy
pathos, his mysticism, his superstition (I am superstitious
enough, God knows, but he was far more so), his divination, his
magician-like foresight into events, his insight, or reading men
through like a pane of glass, his restless wandering, his poetry.
From a very strong strain of Bourbon blood (Richard showed
"race" from the top of his head to the sole of his feet) which the
Burtons inherit&mdash;that is, <i>my</i> Burtons&mdash;he got his fencing, knowledge
of arms, his ready wit and repartee, his boyish gaiety of character as
alternately opposed to his melancholy, and, lastly, but not least, his
Catholicism as opposed to the mysticism of the East, which is not
in the least like the Agnosticism of the West. But it was not a
fixed thing like my Catholicism; it ran silently threaded through
his life, alternately with his mysticism, like the refrain of an opera.</p>

<p>He was proud of his Scottish and North England blood, he
liked his Rob Roy descent, and also his Bourbon blood, and he
used to laugh heartily when, sometimes, I was half-vexed at something
and used to chaff him by saying, "You dirty Frenchman!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard was a regular <i>gamin</i>; his keen sense of humour, his
ready wit, were always present. He adored shocking dense people
and seeing their funny faces and stolid belief, and never cared about
what harm it would do him in a worldly sense. I have frequently
sat at the dinner-table of such people, praying him by signs not to
go on, but he was in a very ecstasy of glee; he said it was so funny
always to be believed when you were chaffing, and so curious never
to be believed when you were telling the truth. He had a sort of
schoolboy bravado about these things that in his high spirits lasted
him all the seventy years of his life.</p>

<p>But especially strong were the melancholy, tender, sad hours of
the man, full of sensitiveness to pathos in all he said, or did, or
wrote. The one paid too much for the other, if I may so express it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_and_Sir_Bernard_Burke"></a>Richard and Sir Bernard Burke.</i></div>

<p>Talking of the Bourbon blood and his <i>gaminerie</i>, during this
visit to Ireland we were in Dublin, where we had the pleasure of
knowing Sir Bernard and Lady Burke, and Richard and he were
talking in his study over his genealogy and this Louis XIV. descent.
He said, "I want this to be made quite clear." Sir Bernard
said, "I wonder, Captain Burton, that <i>you</i>, who have such good
Northern and Scottish blood in your veins, and are connected
with so many of the best families, should trouble about what can
only be a morganatic descent at best." I can see him now, carelessly
leaning against the bookcase with his hands in his pockets, with his
amused face on, looking at the earnest countenance of Sir Bernard
and saying, "Why! I would rather be the bastard of a King, than
the son of an honest man," and his hearty laugh at the shocked
expression and "<i>Oh!</i> Captain Burton," which he had been
waiting for.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bianconi"></a>Bianconi.</i></div>

<p>One of the amusing things, and interesting as well, was going
to Gerald's Cross by rail, and when we arrived, there was only one
car. There was another gentleman and ourselves, and as we had
telegraphed for the car, it was ours. Still we did not like to leave
him without anything. So we asked him if we could give him a lift.
He asked us where we were going, and we told him. So he said,
"Well, you pass my house, so I shall be grateful." As we drove
along for about half an hour between Gerald's Cross and Cashel,
he told us that he was Bianconi, the first inventor of outside Irish
cars, that his house was called Longfield, and the whole of his most
interesting history. His house was a nice little residence in a
garden with a lawn and trees in front, and he insisted upon taking
us into it, and giving us afternoon tea, after which we drove on.</p>

<p>We visited Tuam, which we <i>both</i> thought a dreadful place; but
the name of Burton was big there, on account of the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
and the Dean, Richard's grandfather and uncle, and hundreds of
the poor crowded round us for <i>bakshish</i> (presents). Richard had
still some old aunts there, who came to dine with us, his grandfather's
daughters. They had a large tract of land here, but
Richard's father had made it over to the aunts, and I was very glad
of it, as I should have been very sorry to have had to stop there.
We were delighted with the fishing population of Lough Corrib, a
cross between Spanish and Irish, who have nothing in common with
the town; they are called Claddhah, pronounced Clather. We
stopped long at the Armagh Cathedral, looking for Drelincourt
tombs, of which there are plenty belonging to Richard's people.
From Drogheda we went to see the Halls of Tara, the site of the
Palace of the Kings, the Stone of Destiny, and then to the site of
the Battle of the Boyne, afterwards to Maynooth College, where
the boys cheered Richard. Then we proceeded to Blarney and
kissed the stone; near Cork to see Captain and Mrs. Lane Fox,
now General and Mrs. Pitt-Rivers; and also to Killarney, and
thought it very pretty but <i>very</i> small. We enjoyed much hospitality
at the Castle during our stay. During all our car-driving
our little horse used to have a middle-of-the-day feed, with a pint
of whisky and water, and she came in at the end of the time in
better condition, and looking in every way better, and twice as frisky
as when she started.</p>

<p>On the 17th of May the Polytechnic in London opened with an
account of Richard's travels in Mecca, and a dissolving view of
Richard's picture in uniform. It was arranged by Mr. Pepper
of "Pepper's Ghost," and a quantity of little green pamphlets with
the lecture were sold at the door. On the 22nd of May we dined
with George Augustus Sala, previous to his going to Algiers, and
also with poor Blakeley of the Guns, in his and Mrs. Blakeley's
pretty little home; he died so sadly afterwards.</p>

<p>Richard was now transferred to Santos, São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Farewell Dinner to Captain R. F. Burton.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Anthropological_Farewell_Dinner"></a>The Anthropological Farewell Dinner.</i></div>

<p>"On Tuesday, April 4th, 1865, there was celebrated an event in
London of such importance to anthropological science as to deserve
an especial record in these pages. On this day the Anthropological
Society of London celebrated the election into their society of five
hundred Fellows, by giving a public dinner to Captain Richard F.
Burton, their senior vice-president. The Right Honourable Lord
Stanley, M.P., F.R.S., F.A.S.L., took the chair, and was supported
on the right by Captain Burton. [Here follows one hundred and
twenty distinguished names.]</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Lord_Derbys_Speech_as_Chairman"></a>Lord Derby's Speech as Chairman.</i></div>

<p>"The noble Chairman, Lord Derby, in proposing 'The health of
Captain Burton,' said&mdash;I rise to propose a toast which will not require
that I should bespeak for it a favourable consideration on your part.
I intend to give you the health of the gentleman in whose honour
we have met to-night. (Loud cheers.) I propose the health of
one&mdash;your cheers have said it before me&mdash;of the most distinguished
Explorers and Geographers of the present day. (Cheers.) I do not
know what you feel, but as far as my limited experience in that
way extends, for a man to sit and listen to his own eulogy is by
no means an unmixed pleasure, and in Captain Burton's presence
I shall say a great deal less about what he has done than I should
take the liberty of doing if he were not here. (Cheers.) But no
one can dispute this, that into a life of less than forty-five years Captain
Burton has crowded more of study, more of hardship, and more of
successful enterprise and adventure than would have sufficed to fill
up the existence of half a dozen ordinary men. (Cheers.) If, instead
of continuing his active career&mdash;as we hope he will for many years to
come&mdash;it were to end to-morrow, he would still have done enough to
entitle him to a conspicuous and permanent place in the annals of
geographical discoverers. (Cheers.) I need not remind you, except
in the briefest way, of the long course of his adventures and their
results. His first important work, the 'History of the Races of Scinde,'
will long continue to be useful to those whose studies lie in that direction,
and those who, like myself, have travelled through that unhappy
valley&mdash;through that young Egypt, which is about as like old Egypt
as a British barrack is like an Egyptian pyramid&mdash;will recognize the
fact that if there have been men who have described that country for
<i>utilitarian</i> purposes more accurately and minutely, no man has
described it with a more graphic pen. (Cheers.) With respect
to his pilgrimage to Mecca, that, I believe, was part only of a
much larger undertaking which local disturbances in the country
prevented being carried out to the fullest extent. (Cheers.) I do
not think I am exaggerating when I say that not more than two or
three Englishmen would have been able to perform that feat. The
only two parallels to it that I recollect in one generation are, the exploring
journeys of Sir Henry Pottinger into Beloochistan, and the
journey of M. Vambéry through the deserts of Central Asia. (Cheers.)
I am speaking only by hearsay and report, but I take the fact to be
this, that the ways of Europeans and Asiatics are so totally different&mdash;I
do not mean in those important acts to which we all pay a certain
amount of attention while we do them, but in those little trifling details
of everyday life, that we do instinctively and without paying
attention to them&mdash;the difference in these respects between the two
races is so wide that the Englishman who would attempt to travel in
the disguise of an Oriental ought to be almost Oriental in his habits
if he hope to carry out that personation successfully. And if that be
true of a journey of a few days, it is far more true of a journey extending
over weeks and months, where you have to keep your secret,
not merely from the casual observer, but from your own servants, your
own friends, and your own travelling companions. To carry through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
an enterprise of that kind may well be a strain on the ingenuity of
any man, and though, no doubt, danger does stimulate our faculties,
still it does not take from the merit of a feat that it is performed
under circumstances in which, in the event of detection, death is
almost certain. (Cheers.) I shall say nothing in this brief review of
that plucky though unsuccessful expedition to the Somali country,
which so nearly deprived the Anthropological Society of one of its
ablest members. But I cannot pass over so lightly the journey into
Harar&mdash;the first attempt to penetrate Eastern Africa in that quarter.
That journey really opened a wide district of country previously unknown
to the attention of civilized man. It led the way indirectly to
the Nile expeditions, which lasted from 1856 to 1859. With respect
to the labours which were gone through in those expeditions, and the
controversies which arose out of those labours, I do not require here
to say anything except to make one passing remark. With regard
to this disputed subject of the Nile, I may be permitted to say&mdash;though
those who are experienced in geographical matters may treat
me as a heretic&mdash;(a laugh)&mdash;I cannot help it if they do, for I speak
by the light only of common sense&mdash;(renewed laughter, and cheers)&mdash;but
it seems to me that there is a little delusion in this notion of
searching for what we call the source of a river. Can you say of any
river that it has a source? It has a mouth, that is certain&mdash;(cheers);&mdash;but
it has a great many sources, and to my mind you might just as
well talk of a plant as having only one root, or a man only one hair
on his head, as of a river having a single source. Every river is fed
from many sources, and it does not seem to me that the mere accident
of hitting upon that which subsequent investigation may prove to be
the largest of its many affluents is a matter about which there need
be much controversy. The real test of the value of this kind of
work is, what is the quantity of land previously unknown which the
discoverer has gone through, and which he has opened up to the
knowledge of civilized man? (Cheers.) Judged by that test, I do
not hesitate to say that the African Expedition of 1856 has been the
most important of our time; the only rival which I could assign to it
being that separate expedition which was undertaken by Dr. Livingstone
through the southern part of the continent. (Hear.) Where
one man has made his way many will follow, and I do not think it is
too sanguine an anticipation, negro chiefs and African fevers notwithstanding,
to expect that within the lifetime of the present generation
we may know as much of Africa, at least, of Africa north of
the equator, and within fifteen degrees south of it, as we know now
of South America. Well, gentlemen, no man returns from a long
African travel with health entirely unimpaired, and our friend was no
exception to the rule. But there are men to whom all effort is unpleasant,
so there are men to whom all rest, all doing nothing, is
about the hardest work to which they could be put, and Captain
Burton recruited his health, as you all know, by a journey to the
Mormon country, travelling thirty thousand miles by sea and land,
and bringing back from that community&mdash;morally, I think, the most
eccentric phenomenon of our days&mdash;a very curious and interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
and, as far as I could judge, the most accurate description we have yet
received. (Cheers.) Now, as to the last phase of the career which
I am attempting to sketch&mdash;the embassy to Dahomè, the discovery
of the Cameroon Mountains, and the travels along the African coast,
I shall only remind you of it, because I am quite sure that the
published accounts must be fresh in all your minds. I do not know
what other people may think of these volumes, but to me they were
a kind of revelation of negro life and character, enabling me to feel,
which certainly I never felt before, that I could understand an
African and barbarian court. As to any theories arising out of
these journeys, as to any speculations which may be deduced from
them, I do not comment upon these here. This is not the place
nor the occasion to do it. All I will say about them is, that when a
man with infinite labour, with infinite research, and at the imminent
risk of his life, has gone to work to collect a series of facts, I think
the least the public can do is to allow him a fair hearing when he
puts his own interpretation upon those facts. (Loud cheers.) I
will add this, that in matters which we all feel to be intensely
interesting, and upon which we all know that our knowledge is
imperfect, any man does us a service who helps us to arrange
the facts which we have at our command, who stimulates inquiry
and thought by teaching us to doubt instead of dogmatizing. I am
quite aware that this is not in all places a popular theory. There
are a great many people who, if you give them a new idea, receive
it almost as if you had offered them personal violence. (Laughter.)
It puts them out. They don't understand it&mdash;they are not used to
it. I think that state of the public mind, which we must all
acknowledge, is the very best defence for the existence of scientific
societies such as that to which many of us belong. It is something
for a man who has got a word to say, to know that there is a society
where he will get a fair and considerate hearing; and, whether the
judgment goes against him or not, at least he will be met by
argument and not by abuse. I think Captain Burton has done good
service to the State in various ways. He has extended our knowledge
of the globe on which we live, and as we happen to be men,
and not mere animals, that is a result which, though it may not
have any immediate utilitarian result, we ought to value. (Cheers.)
He has done his share in opening savage and barbarous countries
to the enterprise of civilized man, and though I am not quite so
sanguine as many good men have been as to the reclaiming of
savage races, one has only to read his and all other travellers'
accounts of African life in its primitive condition, to see that
whether they gain much or not by European intercourse, at any
rate they have nothing to lose. (Laughter.) But there is something
more than that. In these days of peace and material prosperity
(and both of them are exceedingly good things), there is another
point of view in which such a career as that of our friend is
singularly useful. It does as much as a successful campaign to
keep up in the minds of the English people that spirit of adventure
and of enterprise, that looking to reputation rather than money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
to love of effort rather than to ease&mdash;the old native English feeling
which has made this country what it has become, and which, we
trust, will keep this country what it is to be&mdash;a feeling which, no
doubt, the tendency of great wealth and material prosperity is to
diminish; but a feeling which, if it were to disappear from among
us, our wealth and our material prosperity would not be worth one
year's purchase. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I propose the health of
Captain Burton, and my best wish for him is that he may do for
himself what nobody else is likely to do for him, that by his future
performance he may efface the memory of his earlier exploits.
(Loud cheers.)</p>

<p>"The toast was drunk with three times three.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_returns_Thanks"></a>Richard returns Thanks.</i></div>

<p>"Captain Burton, who, on rising, was greeted with loud and protracted
cheering, said&mdash;My Lord Stanley, my lords and gentlemen,
it falls to the lot of few men to experience a moment so full of
gratified feeling as this, when I rise to return thanks for the honour
you have done me on this, to me, most memorable occasion. I am
proud to see my poor labours in the cause of discovery thus publicly
recognized by the representative of England's future greatness.
(Cheers.) The terms of praise which have fallen from your lordship's
lips are far above my present deserts, yet I treasure them
gratefully in my memory as coming from one so highly honoured,
not only as a nobleman, but as a man. I am joyed when looking
round me to see so many faces of friends who have met to give me
God-speed&mdash;to see around me so many of England's first men,
England's brains, in fact; men who have left their mark upon the
age; men whose memories the world will not willingly let die.
These are the proudest laurels a man can win, and I shall wear
them in my heart of hearts that I may win more of them on my
return.</p>

<p>"But, however gratifying this theme, I must bear in mind the
occasion which thus agreeably brings us together. We meet to
commemorate the fact that on March 14, 1865, that uncommonly
lusty youth, our young Anthropological Society, attained the respectable
dimensions of five hundred members. My lord and gentlemen,
it is with no small pride that I recall to mind how, under the
auspices of my distinguished and energetic friend Dr. James Hunt,
our present president,&mdash;and long may he remain so,&mdash;I took the
chair on the occasion of its nativity. The date was January 6, 1863.
The number of those who met was eleven. Each had his own
doubts and hopes, and fears touching the viability of the new-born.
Still we knew that our cause was good; we persevered, we succeeded.
(Cheers.)</p>

<p>"The fact is, we all felt the weight of the great want. As a
traveller and a writer of travels during the last fifteen years, I have
found it impossible to publish those questions of social economy
and those physiological observations, always interesting to our common
humanity, and at times so valuable. The <i>Memoirs of the
Anthropological Society</i> now acts the good Samaritan to facts which
the publisher and the drawing-room table proudly pass by. Secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
there was no arena for the public discussion of opinions now
deemed paradoxical, and known to be unpopular. The rooms of
the Anthropological Society, No. 4, St. Martin's Place, now offer a
refuge to destitute truth. There any man, monogenist or polygenist,
eugenestic or dysgenestic, may state the truth as far as is in him.
We may truly call these rooms</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Where, girt by friend or foe,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A man may say the thing he will.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>All may always claim equally from us a ready hearing, and what as
Englishmen we prize the most, a fair field and plenty of daylight.
(Cheers.)</p>

<p>"And how well we succeeded&mdash;how well our wants have been
supplied by the officers of our society, we may judge by this fact:
During the last twenty days not less than thirty members have, I
am informed by my friend Mr. Carter Blake, been added to the five
hundred of last month. I confidently look forward to the day when,
on returning from South America, I shall find a list of fifteen
hundred names of our society. We may say <i>vires acquirit eundo</i>, which
you will allow me to translate, 'We gain strength by our go,' in other
words, our progress. This will give us weight to impress our profession
and opinions upon the public. Already the learned of
foreign nations have forgotten to pity us for inability to work off
the grooves of tradition and habit. And we <i>must</i> succeed so long
as we adhere to our principles of fair play and a hearing to every
man. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>"I would now request your hearing for a few words of personal
explanation, before leaving you for some years. I might confide
it to each man separately, but I prefer the greatest possible publicity.
It has come to my ears that some have charged me with want of
generosity in publishing a book which seems to reflect upon the
memory of poor Captain Speke. Without entering into details concerning
a long and melancholy misunderstanding, I would here
briefly state that my object has ever been, especially on this
occasion, to distinguish between <i>personal enmities</i> and <i>scientific
differences. I did not consider myself bound to bury my opinions
in Speke's grave; to me, living, they are of importance.</i> I adhere
to all I have stated respecting the Nile sources; but I must change
the form of their expression. My own statement may, I believe, be
considered to be moderate enough. In a hasty moment, I appended
one more, which might have been omitted&mdash;as it shall from all
future editions. I may conclude this painful controversial subject,
by stating that Mr. Arthur Kinglake, of Weston-super-Mare, writes
to me that a memorial bust of my lamented companion is to be
placed this year in the shire-hall, Taunton, with other Somersetshire
heroes, Blake and Locke. I have seen the bust in the studio of
Mr. Papworth, and it is perfect. If you all approve, it would give
me the greatest pleasure to propose a subscription for the purpose
before we leave this room. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>"And now I have already trespassed long enough upon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
patience. I will not excuse myself, because I am so soon to leave
you. Nor will I say adieu, because I shall follow in mind all your
careers; yours, my Lord Stanley, to that pinnacle of greatness
for which Nature and Fate have destined you; and yours, gentlemen
and friends, each of you, to the high and noble missions to which
you are called. Accompanied by your good wishes, I go forth on
mine with fresh hope, and with a vigour derived from the wholesome
stimulus which you have administered to me this evening. My
Lord Stanley, my lords and gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.</p>

<p>"[Here followed twenty-five speeches. Dr. Hunt, the President,
concluded:] He should be very sorry if they were to separate on
that occasion, when they had met to bid farewell to Captain Burton,
without drinking the health of one on whom they all looked with
respect and admiration&mdash;Mrs. Burton. (Loud cheers.) He felt it,
therefore, to be their duty to join most heartily in drinking long
health and prosperity to Mrs. Burton, and may she be long spared
to take care of her husband when far away in South America. Those
who paid homage to her paid homage also to him, whom they had
met to honour, and the more they knew of him the more they
respected him. (Loud cheers.)</p>

<p>"Captain Burton: I only hope in the name of Heaven that Mrs.
Burton won't hear of this. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>"Dr. Hunt said that as Captain Burton refused to respond to the
toast in a proper manner, he must return thanks for Mrs. Burton.
She begged him to say that she had great difficulty in keeping her
husband in order, but that she would do what she could to take care
of him, and to make him as innocent a man as they believed him
to be. (Loud laughter.)</p>

<p>"Lord Stanley then left, and the company soon afterwards
separated."</p></blockquote>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nile.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_speaks_his_Mind_about_the_Nile"></a>He speaks his Mind about the Nile.</i></div>

<p>Richard's speech alluded to the following. I take it from his
private, not his published writings:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have five main objections to Jack's theory about the Nile:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. There is a difference of levels in the upper and in the lower
part of the so-called lake. This point is important only when taken
in connection with the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"2. The native report that the Mwerango river rises from the
hills in the centre of the so-called lake.</p>

<p>"3. The general belief that there is a road through the so-called
lake.</p>

<p>"4. The fact that the southern part of the so-called lake floods the
country for thirteen miles, whereas the low and marshy northern
shore is not inundated.</p>

<p>"5. The phenomena that the so-called lake swells during the dry
period of the Nile, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>"It would of course have been far more congenial to my feelings
to have met Jack upon the platform, and to have argued out this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
affair, openly, before the Association of Science. I went down fairly
to seek this contest on September 13th, 1864. The first day was
devoted to other subjects, and the second day our grand exposition
of our separate views was to come off, and the rooms of the Section E
were crowded to suffocation.</p>

<p>"All the great people were with the Council, I alone was uninvited;
so I remained on the platform with my wife, notes in hand, longing
for the fray, but when they filed in twenty minutes later, the
melancholy announcement was made of his death. I had seen him
between one and three p.m., and at four p.m. he was a corpse! I
was so shocked, so pained, I could not speak, and remained so for
a long while. His death sealed my lips, but I am not bound to bury
my opinions in his grave; and when I at last dared to speak, I
addressed a public already horribly prejudiced by the partisans of
Jack, who know nothing about chivalry, and have spoken of me in
terms which I never used towards my dead friend. In short, all my
achievements were ignored and forgotten. Everybody is mentioned
with honour, but the Pioneer of discovery in these wild regions is
carefully ignored. I am now about to leave Europe for some years,
and I cannot allow errors which are generally received, to remain as
they are, but I do not stand forth as an enemy of the departed. No
man better than I, can appreciate the noble qualities of energy,
courage, and perseverance which he so eminently possessed, who
knew him for so many years, who travelled with him as a brother,
till the unfortunate rivalry respecting the Nile sources arose like
a ghost between us, and was fanned to a flame by the enmity and
ambition of so-called friends. I do not wish to depreciate the
services of Jack, nor Captain Grant&mdash;they brought us back a new
three hundred and fifty geographical miles; but as to the <i>Nile</i> sources,
I consider the problem wholly unsolved. Jack and Captain Grant
seemed to forget that the <i>more my</i> expedition did, the better for
them, as well as for me. The result of Jack's expedition is a blank
space on the maps, covering nearly twenty-nine thousand miles and
containing possibly half a dozen waters. Had Jack and Captain
Grant really seen&mdash;which they did not&mdash;three sides of the Nyanza,
they would have left unexplored fifty thousand square geographical
miles, a space somewhat larger than England and Wales.</p>

<p>"Knowing Jack as I do, I cannot understand why he sent
Captain Grant, without valid apparent reason, on July 19th, 1862,
to the head-quarters of King Kamrasi of Unyoro, right away <i>from</i>
the Lakes, unless Jack was determined <i>alone</i> to do the work, and
to have no one to contradict him. The <i>Westminster Review</i>
remarks of that: 'Grant will have little to regret, and Burton will
be more than revenged should Tanganyika, and not the Nyanza,
prove to be the head of the Nile.'</p>

<p>"From Alexandria Jack telegraphed in April, 1863, to the F.O.
these big words:&mdash;'Inform Sir Roderick Murchison that all is
well, that we are in latitude 14° 30' upon the Nile, and that the Nile
is settled.' The startling assertion caused a prodigious sensation
at the main meeting, May 11th, 1863. Jack was fêted in Egypt by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
his Highness the Khedive and by his Majesty of Piedmont, and was
presented with a medal bearing the gratifying inscription, 'Honor est
a Nilo.' At Southampton he was received by the civic authorities
and sundry supporters, including Colonel Rigby of Zanzibar, who, for
purely private reasons, had supported Jack against <i>me</i>. On June
22nd, 1863, Jack received an ovation in the shape of a special meeting
of the Royal Geographical Society, when the windows were broken
in by the eager crowd. By-and-by people began to cool their
enthusiasm. Despite all that Jack had done to me, I was the first
to give flattering opinions of the exploration, until the personal
account Jack gave, told me how little had been done. It was something
to have passed over three hundred and fifty untrodden miles,
but it would take a great deal more than that to settle the Nile
problem. Jack tried to crush all expressions of thought. A welcome
to Jack was put forth in 1863 by <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, a
periodical from which, for reasons <i>best known to myself</i>, I never
expected, nor wanted to receive justice. The author of 'The
Welcome,' who sought advertisement, wrote: 'We were the first
to satisfy ourselves with Captain Speke's geographical views.'</p>

<p>"In January, 1864, Jack's book appeared, 'The Discovery of
the Sources of the Nile.' It sold like wildfire at first, and then
suddenly dropped, like the stick of the firework. Then Messrs.
Blackwood brought out 'What led to the Discovery of the Sources
of the Nile,' and people were saying that 'non-discovery would be
the fitting term;' and the second stick fell from the rocket. I
understood then the danger to which I had exposed myself by <i>not
travelling alone</i>, when I perceived that a lake, seen only for twenty
miles, at the southern edge, was prolonged by mere guesswork to
two hundred and forty miles to the north&mdash;enough to stultify the
whole Expedition. Had we met at Bath, the discussion which <i>must</i>
have resulted would have brought forth a searching scrutiny upon
<i>both our Expeditions</i>, and mine would have been found to have been
a genuine article; as it is, I am obliged to remain dumb upon many
points upon which, if Jack had been alive, I should certainly have
spoken. After so long a silence upon the subject, I am justified in
drawing public attention as to what was effected by <i>my</i> Expedition,
in which I was not only unaided, but I may say hindered. I went
into the country ignorant of it, its language, trade, manners, and
customs, preceded only by a French naval officer, who was murdered
almost directly he landed. My friend Hamerton, the Consul
at Zanzibar, was dying. Without money, or support, or influence,
lacking in the necessaries of life, I led the most disorderly caravan
that ever man could gather together, into the heart of Eastern
Africa, and discovered the Tanganyika and the Nyanza Lakes. I
brought home sufficient information to smooth the path of all who
chose to follow me. They had but to read 'The Lake Regions of
Central Africa' (2 vols., 1860), and the whole of Vol. XXXIII. of
the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</i> (Clowes and Sons,
1860), to know all about it. Dr. Beke called mine emphatically 'a
memorable expedition;' but, except for a few esteemed friends, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
work has been ignored and forgotten. <i>My</i> labours rendered the
road easy for Jack and Captain Grant. I opened the line to Englishmen,
and they had but to follow me.</p>

<p>"I bring no charge against Jack of asserting what he does not
believe. In his Taunton speech he declared that, 'as the <i>real</i> discoverer,
he had in 1857 hit the Nile on the head, and in 1863
drove it down to the Mediterranean,' and he believed these words
as firmly and as unreasoningly as he did in his Victoria Nyanza Lake
or his 'Mountains of the Moon.' His peculiar habit of long brooding
over thoughts and memories, secreting them until some sudden
impulse brought them forth, may explain this great improbability.
He could not grasp a fact; hence his partial eclipse of the moon
on the 5th and 6th of January, 1863, which did not occur. A
'luxurious village' was a mass of dirty huts, a 'king of kings' is
a petty chief, a 'splendid port' is a display of savagery. The
French of those parts are barbarians, with little more knowledge
than their neighbours.</p>

<p>"Captain Grant also has never acknowledged the vast benefits
which the second Expedition derived from mine. I therefore mean
to produce a small volume, called 'The Nile Basin,'<a name="FNanchor_2_148" id="FNanchor_2_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_148" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in which I
shall distinctly deny that any 'misleading, by my instructions from
the Royal Geographical Society as to the position of the White Nile,'
left me unconscious of the vast importance of ascertaining the
Rusizi river's direction. The fact is Jack was deaf and almost
blind, I was paralytic, we were both helpless, and I may add penniless;
we did our best to reach it, and we failed.</p>

<p>"I must also again allude to Jack's 'Mountains of the Moon.' He
published a sketch-map in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, September and
October, 1859, which showed a huge range estimated to rise six or
eight thousand feet high. At first the segment of a circle, it gradually
shaped itself into a colt's foot, and effectually cut off all access from
the Tanganyika to the Nile; then he owns in his book, p. 263, to
having built up these mountains on solely geographical <i>reasonings</i>,
deriving from the same source the Nile, the Congo, and the Zambesi.
Now, Captain Grant afterwards said that the mountains were the work
of the engraver, and that Jack was amused by them; but if he had
looked into the map-room of the Royal Geographical Society, he
would have found Jack's own map, showing the lunar horseshoe in
all its hideousness. Now, in the map done by Stanford, the Mountains
of the Moon are placed in the northern extremity of the Lake
Tanganyika; but in his <i>own</i> map, published in his <i>journal</i>, he altered
their position, and inserted them round the western north-sides of
the more northern Lake Rusizi, which was manifestly a widening
of the river; and again he said, p. 324, 'It was a pity I did not
change the course I gave to the Maraungu river, <i>i.e.</i> making it an
effluent, and not an influent; I forgot my lesson, and omitted to do
so;' and when he inquires of the natives whether this river runs
<i>into</i> or <i>out</i> of the lake, he says, 'Because they all say it runs into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
the lake, <i>I</i> am quite convinced that it runs out of the lake,' which,
to say the least of it, is an extraordinary train of reasoning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Macqueen, an old and scientific geographer, was told by
an Arab who had been to Unyamwezi, 'It is well known by all the
people there, that the river which goes through Egypt takes its
source and origin from the Lake Tanganyika.' Dr. Beke, an old
and scientific traveller, quotes De Barros: 'The Nile has its origin
in a great lake, the Tanganyika, and after traversing many miles
northwards, it enters a very large lake which lies under the equator.'
This would, I believe, be the Bahr el Ghazal, or the Luta Nzigé.
With regard to the levels, the Tanganyika is allowed but 1844 feet,
but during our exploration the state of our vision would, I am sure,
explain a greater difference than the fraction of a degree. At Conduci,
a harbour on the East African coast, a common wooden bath
instrument boiled at 2˙14° Fahr.: this would give a difference of
about 1000 feet. The Nyanza was made 3550 feet high by my
expedition, that of Jack raised it to 3745 feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Macqueen, F.R.G.S., author of the 'Geographical Survey
of Africa,' wrote a very able review on Jack's expedition with Captain
Grant, and I shall reprint it in the 'Nile Basin' from the <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>. In it he speaks in unmeasured terms about the cruelty
of the manner in which he crushed Consul Petherick with his ill-temper,
vanity, and jealousy, having used him in his own service all
he could. Petherick wrote: 'To add insult to injury, flesh and blood
cannot bear it, and, whilst not wishing to depreciate the labours of
others, I am determined to maintain my own;' and Mrs. Petherick
wrote an account of Jack's dining with them. They had a tremendously
large ham, which they had brought from England, cooked.
They were to wait with boats, well armed and provisioned, until
Jack should appear at Gondokoro. They waited long beyond their
time, they spent their money, they lost their health, they sacrificed
their own trade, and Jack, having helped himself to what he wanted,
treated them <i>de haut en bas</i>. Mrs. Petherick writes: 'We always
meant to open this ham when we met Speke. During dinner I
endeavoured to prevail on Speke to accept our aid, but he drawlingly
replied, "I do not wish to recognize the 'succour-dodge.'"'
She adds, 'The rest of the conversation I am not well enough to
repeat. I grow heartsick thinking of it after all our toil. Never
mind, his heartlessness will recoil upon him yet. I soon left the
table, and would never dine with them again.'</p>

<p>"But when Jack got home, and was in the full fling of his triumph,
his unfounded charges influenced the Government, who had employed
Petherick to convey assistance and advice to Jack, whose
flippant conduct caused this man and his wife to be thrown overboard
without pity, his private fortune wasted, his character as a merchant
and a public servant blasted, being also deprived of his Consulship.
Mr. Macqueen, in his paper, said that Speke left England on a great
and noble enterprise. He was patronised and supported by the
British Government, by the Royal Geographical Society, and the
good wish and sanguine hopes of the public. He says it is incredible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
that any man, but especially a man who had gone a thousand miles
to see the position of the outlet of the Nile supposed to be in that
spot, should have remained five months within eight miles of it,
without hearing or seeing something certain about the great object
of his search, or have found some means to see it. He says, 'All
that he brought back was the sacrifice and ruin of zealous associates,
first Burton, then Petherick, Grant treated as a cipher, and a mass
of intelligence, if such it can be called, so muddled and confused
that we do not believe he understands it himself. We regret the
miserable termination which the second great African exploration
has had; we lament the time that has been lost, and the money that
has been spent; but the only person to blame for its poor results is
Captain Speke himself.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>During this stay at home we had represented to Lord Russell how
miserable our lives were, being always separated by the climate of
Fernando Po, and he very kindly transferred us to Santos, in the
Brazils, where I <i>could</i> go. So Richard agreed that I should go out
with him to Portugal for a trip; that he should go on to Rio de
Janeiro; that I should return to London to wind up our affairs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
then join him at Santos; and we set sail in May. I now began to
learn Portuguese. We had very bad weather, and on the fourth day
we arrived at Lisbon, and went to the Braganza Hotel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_explore_Portugal"></a>We explore Portugal.</i></div>

<p>Here was a totally new experience for me. Our bedroom was a
large white-washed place; there were three holes in the wall, one at
the bedside bristling with horns, and these were cockroaches some
three inches long. The drawing-room was gorgeous with yellow
satin, and the magnificent yellow curtains were sprinkled with these
crawling things; the consequence was that I used to stand on a
chair and scream. This annoyed Richard very much. "A nice
sort of traveller and companion <i>you are</i> going to make," he said.
"I suppose you think you look very pretty and interesting, standing
on that chair and howling at those innocent creatures." This hurt
me so much that, without descending from the chair, I stopped
screaming and, made a meditation, like St. Simon Stylites on his
pillar, and it was, "that if I was going to live in a country always
in contact with these and worse things, though I had a perfect
horror of anything black and crawling, it would never do to go on
like that." So I got down, fetched a basin of water and a slipper,
and in two hours, by the watch, I had knocked ninety-seven of them
into it. It cured me. From that day I had no more fear of vermin
and reptiles, which is just as well in a country where nature is over-luxuriant.
A little while after we changed our rooms, we were
succeeded by the late Lord and Lady Lytton, and, to my infinite
delight, I heard the same screams coming from the same rooms a
little while after. "There!" I said in triumph, "you see, I am
not the <i>only</i> woman who does not like cockroaches."</p>

<p>Here he insisted on taking me to a bull-fight, because he said
I ought to see everything <i>once</i>. But there is a great difference
between a Spanish and a Portuguese bull-fight. In Portugal the
bull's horns are knobbed; he does not gore horses nor dogs&mdash;he
tosses men softly, and if I do not mind that, it is because the
men go in for it willingly, are paid for it, and are bred to
it as a profession from father to son for endless generations. The
only torment the bull has to endure is the darts thrown into the
fat part of his neck. If he fights well, they are taken out afterwards
and his wounds dressed with oil, and he is turned out loose
to fight another day. If he won't fight, he is killed for beef; so you
get all the science and the play without the disgusting cruelty. At
first I crouched down with my hands over my face, but I gradually
peeped through first one finger and then another, until I saw the
whole of it; but it awed me so much that I was almost afraid to
come out of our box, for fear we should meet a bull on the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p>We then went to Cintra, and to Mafra. Richard found an old
mosque in Cintra, and we saw Mr. Cooke's beautiful house.<a name="FNanchor_1_149" id="FNanchor_1_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_149" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> For
people who have not been to Lisbon, I may say that Belem Church
is, I think, quite the most beautiful thing in the world. It is one of
the noted dreams in marble. From Lisbon we went on to Corregado,
to Serçal and Caldas, to see Alcobaço, where there is a most beautiful
monastery. In the days of rebellion and persecution, the days of
Don Miguel, somewhere in the early thirties, the monks had to clear
out, and my father took one of them, whose name was Antonio
Barboza de Lima, to be our tutor and chaplain, when we were
children (and he is now buried at Mortlake); so Richard and I took
an extra interest in the details. We then went to Batalha, where
there is another beautiful monastery, to Pombal, to Leiria, and to
Coimbra. This seat of learning is one of the prettiest, dirtiest,
and slowest places imaginable, and we soon made our way to
Oporto, and went to Braga to see the Whit-Sunday <i>fête</i>, from thence
to Malozinhos. This northern part of Portugal is ever so much more
beautiful than Lisbon. The more you get into Douro, and the
nearer you are to Spain, the larger and handsomer become the
people.</p>

<p>However, our time was short, and, after a delightful two months'
Portuguese exploration, we had to get back to Lisbon, where
we saw another bull-fight, and Richard embarked for Brazil. I
promised him to go back by the very next steamer that sailed.
As I used to keep my word <i>very literally</i>, a few hours after his
departure, a very tiny steamer came in, much worse than the West
African boats; but I thought myself obliged to go, and we started
at 9.20 in the evening, in spite of north-easterly gales, and had a
bad time of it in the Bay of Biscay, she being only 428 tons. The
route was from London to Lisbon, Gibraltar, Mazagan, Mogador,
Canary Islands, coast of Spain, Morocco, and Portugal. On board,
besides myself, having made the same mistake, was Dona Maria Rita
Tenorio y Moscoso, who afterwards married the Portuguese Minister
in London, Count Lavradio. We were in a tremendous fog off
Beachy Head, went aground somewhere near Erith in the fog, and
were very glad to land on the eighth day, having roughed it prodigiously.
I note nothing important except some very interesting
experiments at Mr. William Crookes's, both chemically and spiritualistically.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_rejoin_him_at_Rio_de_Janeiro"></a>I rejoin him at Rio de Janeiro.</i></div>

<p>By end of August, <i>i.e.</i> in a month, my work was accomplished, and
I may as well now say, that whenever we were going to leave England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
for any length of time, he used mostly to like to start <i>at once</i> in
light marching order, go forward and prospect the place, and leave
me behind to settle up our affairs, pay and pack, bringing up the
heavy baggage in the rear. It saved time, as double work got done
in the space; so, having completed all, I embarked from Southampton
in one of the Royal mails. Heavy squalls and thunder and lightning
began next day, and at Lisbon the thermometer was 80° in the
cabin. We passed Santa Cruz, off Teneriffe, having a good view
of the Peak. We got to St. Vincent in ten days, quite the most
wretched hole in the world&mdash;only barren rocks, and the heat was like
a dead wall. We had very charming people on board, mostly all
foreigners, except Mr. and Mrs. Wodehouse, and Mr. Conyngham.
Neptune came on board on the night of the 24th, we crossed the
Line on the 25th, and the ceremonies of "crossing the Line" were
gone through, the tubbing and shaving, the greasy pole and running
in sacks, and a hair was drawn across the field-glasses, through
which you were requested to look at the "Line." The perhaps
most striking thing to a new-comer going out, is losing the Great
Bear and the Northern Star, and all that one is accustomed to, and
exchanging them for the Southern Cross and others.</p>

<p>We arrived at Pernambuco on the 27th, and there I found all the
letters that I had written to my husband since we parted, accumulated
in the post-office, consequently I did not know what he would
think had become of me. Here we had a very rough sea and boiling
surf. I passed the evening miserably, thinking about the letters;
though everything was looking very beautiful, and the band was
playing tunes and everybody waltzing, I sat by the wheel and had a
good "boo-hoo" in the moonlight. On the 30th we reached Bahía,
and went ashore and lunched with Mrs. Baines, and visited Mr.
Charles Williams. The women wanted to sell me small black babies
in the market for two shillings. We sailed the same day, and had
heavy weather. I rose at five, just before we went into the harbour
at Rio. It is about the most glorious sight that a human being can
behold, at sunrise and at sunset, the mountains being of most fantastic
shapes, and the colours that of an opal. Richard said it beats all
the scenery he had ever seen in his life&mdash;even the Bosphorus. He
came on board at half-past eight in the morning, and we had a joyful
meeting, and I handed him all the letters which, by some strange
mischance, had accumulated at Pernambuco during our month's
separation.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Estrangeiros Hotel, where there was quiet,
fresh air, beautiful scenery, and several disadvantages, including
cockroaches and mosquitoes. We enjoyed a great deal of hospitality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
both Naval and Diplomatic, and had several excursions and picnics.
All nations have a "Flagship" and other ships in the harbour; there
is a great deal of gaiety and <i>esprit de corps</i> amongst the Diplomatic
and Consular service. Amongst others here was Mr. Gerald Perry,
our Minister, Sir Edward and Lady Thornton, Chevalier Bunsen,
the son of the great Bunsen, with whom we used to have learned
discussions very often in the evening on "Geist" and other scientific
subjects, and German metaphysics generally. Mrs. Elliot, the wife
of Admiral Elliot, the Admiral of the Station, was a very kind friend
to me, on this my first <i>début</i> into this kind of life. We had our first
dinner-party at our hotel, and after all the formal people had gone,
Richard and the young ones proposed a moonlight walk. We went
down to the Botanical Gardens, and tried to get in, but the gates
were locked&mdash;tall iron gates&mdash;and nothing would do but that, as we
could not get in, we should scramble over them. It was quite contrary
to law, but we had a nice walk about the gardens. There was
either no watch-dog, or the guard being unaccustomed to such
daring, was not on the look-out; but there were too many snakes
about, and particularly the coral snake, of which nobody has any
idea in England, because its colours fade as soon as it is put in
spirits; so we all came back and climbed over the gate again, and
got back without any danger.</p>

<p>But we had come out of hot rooms, and it was dewy and damp,
so next day I had my first fever. It consisted of sickness and
vomiting, colic, dizziness, faintness, shivering, heat and cold, delirium,
thirst, disgust of food. The treatment was calomel, castor oil, hot
baths, blankets, emetics, ice, starvation, and thirty grains of quinine.
It did not last long, but my being delirious alarmed Richard very
much, and he mesmerized me.</p>

<p>In Rio one generally takes a native steamer, which is not
very comfortable, to go to Santos, one hundred and twenty miles
south of Rio. As soon as I was able to move, Captain Napier
took us on board H.M.S. <i>Triton</i> for Santos. It was very rough.
The captain had given up his quarters to me; the stern ports were
not closed, and at night a tremendous sea came in, and swept our
cots. It continued very squally, and we anchored at Ilha Grande;
next day the men practised gunnery and small-arms, and Captain
Napier made me practise with a revolver. It was fifty-eight miles from
Rio to Ilha Grande, a pretty mountainous island, which surrounds a
lovely bay, with a few huts on it. We then proceeded seventy-eight
miles further to St. Sebastian, which is a grand copy of the Straits of
Messina (Scylla and Charybdis), and spoils your after-view of what
people who have seen nothing bigger, think so wonderful. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
steam through an arm of the sea, appearing like a gigantic river,
surrounded by mountains (whose verdure casts a green shade upon
the water), dotted with houses, small towns, and gardens. The chief
town is St. Sebastian, which is very populous. The water is calm;
there is a delicious sea-breeze. When Richard went ashore they
saluted him with the usual number of guns, and Brazilian local
"swells" came off to visit us.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Santos, Brazil, his Second Consulate.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Arrival_at_Santos_and_Sao_Paulo"></a>Arrival at Santos and São Paulo.</i></div>

<p>We awoke next morning, the 9th of October, 1865, off the Large.
About eleven we were at the mouth, whence one steams about
nine miles up a serpentine river, and at one o'clock anchored
opposite Santos. We saluted, and the Consular corps came off to
see us. We stayed on board that night, and we left the ship at
half-past seven next day, loitering about Santos.</p>

<p>Santos was only a mangrove swamp, and in most respects
exactly like the West Coast of Africa, the road slushy and deep.
Tree-ferns, African mangrove, brown water full of tannin, patches
of green light and green dark, in rare clearings here and there
houses and fields near town, much water, and good rice. The sand
runs up to the mangrove jungle; there is good fishing, and deer in
the forests. The heavy sea sometimes washes into the gardens,
spoils the flowers, and throws up whale-bones in all directions. At
the time of our arrival, the railway from Santos to São Paulo, about
eighty miles into the interior, was only just beginning, and a large
staff of Englishmen were engaged upon it. Mr. J. J. Aubertin, now,
since his freedom, poet, author, and traveller, was then superintendent
of it. Richard had been here, and inspected the place before my
arrival, although he had met me at Rio, and he had arranged, as
there were <i>two</i> places <i>equally requiring the presence of a Consul</i> (São
Paulo on the top of the Serra, and Santos on the coast), that we
should live at both places, riding up and down as occasion required,
thus keeping our health; and Mr. Glennie, the Vice-Consul&mdash;who
had gone to Santos as a boy, had been there over forty years, had
married there, was perfectly devoted to it, and the only hardship he
would have known would have been to live out of it&mdash;could remain
there. His one ambition of life was to be Consul of Santos, and
when we left, some years after, and his nomination was just going
out to him, he died&mdash;as Richard used to say, "so like Provy."</p>

<p>We therefore, that same day, went in trollies to Mugis, where we
lunched. Richard and Captain Napier had started on foot, and
soon after Mr. Aubertin and thirteen others joined us. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
twenty-one people. Dr. and Mrs. Hood lived at the foot of the
Serra, and they gave us a big tea-dinner. Mrs. Hood, the widow,
with her now large grown-up family, strange to say, is now my near
neighbour in Mortlake. Next day, what with mules, walking, riding,
and occasional trollies, we got at the top of the Serra. There was a
huge chasm over which the rail would have to pass on a bridge, with
an almost bottomless drop. There were only planks across it; but,
as I was on in front, supposing that was what we had got to cross,
I walked right across it, about some two hundred yards. When I
got to the other side, I turned round to speak, but nobody answered
me, and facing round I saw the whole company standing on the
other side, not daring to breathe, and my husband looking ghastly;
so I turned round and was going to walk back again, when they
motioned me off by signs, and all began to file round another way
on <i>terra firma</i>. It was fortunate that I had such a good head, and
did not know my danger.</p>

<p>The train line up the Serra is a very steep incline, one in nine,
and is managed by a chain with a stationary engine at the top,
a train being hooked on at each end of the rope. On one side
was a mountain wall, and the other side a bottomless abyss, but the
whole thing was quite beautiful through virgin forest. At this time
it was not far advanced enough, and we rode up on mules. At the top
a locomotive was kept to take us into São Paulo, which reminded us
of Bergamo, in Italy, where we all dined at the little French inn.
The next day we took a trip to what was then the end of the line,
twelve miles beyond São Paulo, but at this time these trips were
part mules, part trollies, part walking ones. We came back to
dinner; there were speeches, and we wished the "Tritons" good-bye.
Richard went down with them to set up his Consulate, and
I remained to look for a house, and set up our <i>first real home</i>.
After twelve or thirteen days, I went down to Santos by the diligence,
by bad roads, but with a lovely panorama. The diligence takes
one as far as Cubatao, where a little steamer plies for a couple of
hours, first up a fine stream, between banks of tangled magnificence
in the vegetation line, then an arm of the sea, or rather lagoons.
The journey occupies seven carriage and two boat hours.</p>

<p>The worst of Santos, besides the steaming heat enclosed within
and at the bottom of the hills, arising from the mangrove swamps,
was the sand-flies and the mosquitoes. Richard was quite impervious
to all other vermin, but the sand-flies used to make him come out
all over bumps. For the rest, he used to say that he liked to have me
near him&mdash;it was just like having "catch 'em alive" for flies, as everything
came and bit me, and I was not fit to be seen, and spared him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact is, I had fresh English blood, and it was rather a treat
to them. The nicest thing was to drive out to the Barra. Captain
Richard Hare, R.N., then came in, and we made a large party to
stay there. The Barra was our fashionable bathing-place; the sea
rolled right in to the strip of sand between it and the mangrove
swamps, on the edge of which were (at that time) a few huts, with
windows and doors opening on to the sand. In some there were
no windows; they only closed by a wooden shutter.</p>

<p>After staying there for some time with Richard, I went up to
São Paulo again, because I was getting feverish; it was wet and
windy, and it took me eleven hours and a half. On going up,
I engaged a very curious little fellow in our service, who deserves
a few lines. Chico was thirty-five years of age; he was about
four feet high, but perfectly well proportioned, as black as a coal,
brimming full of intelligence, and could put his hand to anything.
He had just been emancipated. He remained with us the whole
time we were in Brazil, and became my right-hand man&mdash;more of
him anon.</p>

<p>At last I found an old convent, No. 72, Rua do Carmo, which
opened on the street in its front, and ran a long way back behind on
an eminence, which commanded a view of almost boundless horizon
into the country, and was exceedingly healthy. I immediately took
it, cleaned it, painted and whitewashed it, and furnished it, and
engaged slaves, paying their masters so much, and so much to them,
as if they were free men. They were all Catholics, and I made a
little chapel for them.</p>

<p>The slaves in Brazil, as a rule, formed, as it were, part of the
family, and in ninety-five houses out of a hundred they were
kindly treated and happy, but the remaining five out of the
hundred were brutal; but, however, in <i>all</i> cases, the poor creatures
were told, or, if not told, were allowed to believe, that they had
no souls, and nothing to look forward to. I, on the contrary,
taught them, and had regular lecture and catechism for them, that
not only had they souls, but that, although they were condemned by
class and colour and custom to be slaves upon earth, just as it was
in the Bible, that once dead, they, and we, would stand equal before
God. The priest used to come to my little Oratory, where I had the
Bishop's leave to have Mass and the Sacraments, and we all received
Communion together. They were very happy, the house went
upon oiled wheels, and I never had occasion to dismiss a servant
the whole time I was there. The differences were chiefly amongst
themselves. Richard having settled his Consulate at Santos, and
I having prepared our home in São Paulo, he came up and joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
me, and for the first time since our marriage we were absolutely
settled in a home of our own.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Life_in_Brazil"></a>Life in Brazil.</i></div>

<p>Up the country in Brazil, people always get one or two things in
their first few years. You either break out all over boils, so that you
cannot put a pin's point between them, and if you have a weak place,
they come there in clusters, and you can neither sit nor stand, kneel
or lie, and you are an object of misery for some months; but if you
have strength, and can pull through it, you bloom out with stronger
health than ever after that. This happened to me. I had to be
slung up. A friend gave me a barrel of porter, and it was alternately
"faint" and a "glass of porter," which revived me for a few
minutes, and then more faint and more porter, <i>ad infinitum</i>. By the
time the barrel of porter was finished, I was convalescent, and when
any new ones attempted to break out, a friend gave me two things
to try&mdash;and I tell it for the sake of those who may follow me; it was
to draw a ring of caustic round one, and a ring of laudanum round
the other. The caustic ones did not answer, but the ring of laudanum
made them disappear, and I got splendid health, which lasted at
least seventeen years. Now, people who do not get the boils are
bound to get one or more of the complicated diseases of the country,
and that is just what happened to Richard. We had no doctors up
there, that I am aware of.</p>

<p>On the 17th of January, 1866, we had an awful storm, worse than
any known for twenty-five years; there was an awful blackness, the
lightning was red, the wind drove in the windows, the hail was jagged
pieces of ice one inch in diameter, sharp and long, and made round
holes like a bullet, there was a network of flashes, rain from all
quarters&mdash;a regular cyclone. It drove through the room fronting
north, which was like a ship's cabin in a gale. We saw the cathedral
struck, the cross knocked off, tiles blown away; the hotel room was
like a shower-bath, with a continuous stream of rain. Several houses
were struck, some of the doors split, and the streets quite flooded;
people were frightened, and lighted candles, and brought out the
Madonna. There were sharp rattlings like earthquake; it blew a clock
against the walls away; the people all met as after a revolution in
Paris. The windows were everywhere broken, and the water looked
black. It was quite local, and did not touch the shipping. In
the town four were killed and five wounded. The next day was
very hot.</p>

<p>Santos is six thousand miles away from Europe, and we only got
letters once a month.</p>

<p>Richard's study was the most important feature in the house. It
was a long room, running out on an eminence forty feet long, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
good terrace at the end of it, on which we had a telescope, and
every convenience for astronomy and observations; and perhaps
the other most striking part of the house was a large room, which
occupied the whole centre of the house, and opened on the stairs.
This was dining-room, receiving-room, and everything. Directly below
that was a similar place, that was more like stables than room. It
was my refuge for the needy and homeless after dark; they were fed
and housed, and turned out in early morning.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July he notes in his journal: "Dream that a bad
tooth fell out, followed by five or six big drops of blood; noted the day,
and found that my poor friend Steinhaüser had died of heart disease
quite suddenly in Switzerland that day." On the 14th of August, 1866,
the first through-train went from Santos to Jundiahy. There was
a <i>fête</i> in consequence, and the company had the bad taste only to
omit the Consul and his wife from the invitations to all the English.
On the 22nd of August Richard went to stop with the priests of the
seminary (Capuchins), which he often did, in their <i>chacara</i>, or country-house,
where he studied astronomy with Fray João, and metaphysics,
physics, and algebra, with Père Germain. Here he was engaged in
writing "Vikram and the Vampire," and he got a concession for the
lead mines of Iporanga, in São Paulo. On the 21st of December
we went down to Rio for our Christmas, which we spent at Petropolis.
On the 12th of November some one put a stone on the railway
to throw the train off, and on the 19th it was said that a part of
the rails was pulled up.</p>

<p>In Santos and São Paulo we remained from 1865 to 1869, and
I may say that his career here was equally active and useful, both
on the coast and in the interior. We thoroughly explored our own
province, São Paulo, which is larger than France. (I do not bore
you with two pages of Brazilian names of places, because very few
would know where they were, unless they had lived there and had
worked in wild places, which is not likely.) We spent a good time
at the gold mines and diamond diggings of Minas Gerães. He
canoed down the river of San Francisco, fifteen hundred miles. He
went to the Argentine Republic of the Páta-Paranà; he went to
Paraguay for the purpose of reporting the state of the Paraguayan War
to the Foreign Office. He crossed the Pampas and the Andes to
Chili and Peru, amongst the dangerous Indians, whilst on sick leave
for an illness which brought him almost to death's door. He visited
the Pacific coast to inspect the scenes of the earthquake at Arica,
returning by the Straits of Magellan, Buenos Ayres, and Rio de
Janeiro.</p>

<p>Letters from Richard to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> appeared in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
numbers, headed, "From London to Rio de Janeiro." He likewise
wrote three books&mdash;"The Highlands of Brazil," 2 vols., which
I edited and brought out in 1869; "Vikram and the Vampire,"
one vol. of Hindú tales brought out in 1870; "Paraguay," 1 vol.,
brought out in 1870. He interested himself immensely in the coffee
and cotton produce, Mr. Aubertin being at that time the "father
of cotton" in Brazil, but his chief interest lay in the mining and
mineral productions of the country. As I have said, he obtained
the concession for the lead mines of Iporanga, and Sir Edward
Thornton was very angry with him&mdash;took it in the sense of Consuls
trading, and reported him home. Fortunately, we had the large
mind of Lord Stanley (Lord Derby) at the head of the Foreign
Office, and he, knowing how caged and misplaced Richard was at
such a Consulate, thought he might at least be allowed that little
bit of amusement, and sent back a despatch that he did not think
that being interested in mineral production could be exactly classed
under the head of trading.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, Richard discovered something remarkable.
On one of our Expeditions we were stopping at a shanty close to a river,
and seeing something glistening, he walked up the bed of the river,
which was not deep, and scooped up some of the sand and put it in a
jar. On washing it we found that it looked very like rubies. We sent it
home to Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., the great chemical savant, and he wrote
back, "If you get any more, bigger than this, throw up the Consulate
and stick to the rubies." Now, Richard told me that this was only the
dust washed down, and that the great stones must lie further up the
head of the river. The shanty belonged to an old woman with a right
for a good stretch up the river, and she would have joyfully sold it
for £50. When I implored Richard almost on my knees to buy it,
he would not, saying it would be quite wrong to defraud that poor
woman out of her place, when she did not know that rubies were
there; that if she <i>did</i> know, she would ask him an exorbitant sum;
and, what was more, that no one could live there for three days
without getting Brazilian fever, so that we should end by being like
the dog in the fable, with the bit of cheese and the shadow in the
water, and drop the reality for a shadow.</p>

<p>Life in Brazil, if in Rio, was very gay; life at São Paulo was
very like a farmhouse life, with cordiality and sociability with the
other farmhouses, and some of the good Brazilian society was very
charming. The Brazilians are to the Portuguese what the Americans
are to us. The Portuguese is heavy; the Brazilian is light, active,
nervous, <i>spirituel</i>. Their parties are much enlivened by music and
dance. They have several native dances, which are danced at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
balls&mdash;one especial one, which is called the <i>carangueijo</i>, which is
very active, very amusing, and very significant. The gentlemen
and ladies dance it as furiously as the common people, as the
Hungarians do the <i>czardas</i>. The Music consists of the <i>modinha</i>,
which answers to our ballad, and is generally mournful; the <i>lundú</i>,
which is mostly comic, and almost always in the minor key; and the
<i>recitativo</i>, which consists of playing a flowing melodious accompaniment,
and in a voice pitched and attuned to that, reciting a
story of love or war or anything, often improvised at the moment.
The negroes have their balls in the Plaza, or Square, and they will
dance furiously for three consecutive days and nights to the same
tune. It is amusing to watch for about an hour out of a window.
The negro girls come out <i>décolletée</i> in pink or blue cotton&mdash;those are
the swells&mdash;the others dress like natives.</p>

<p>What is so beautiful is Nature, the luxuriance of vegetable and
animal life. Everything is so large&mdash;the palms, the cacti, and all the
things which here are treasured as plants and bushes, are there fine
trees. I have seen arums of which one leaf would be six feet long and
five broad, behind which a big man could easily hide himself. The
virgin forests are unspeakably beautiful, with their wild tangle of
creeper and parasite. Orchids, of which (during the rage that lasted
in England for them) one single one would have sold for £60, here
grow wild&mdash;one only had to go out with a knife and grub them up from
the trees or rocks; we sent boxes home to our friends. The fir of
the country is the araucaria; the gum copaiba is eighty feet high.
Flights of gaudy-coloured parrots and all sorts of beautiful coloured
birds are on the trees; butterflies, some of which measure ten
inches from one wing-tip to the other, when spread, float about the
air like large sheets of paper&mdash;scarlet, peacock blue, emerald green,
cream, white&mdash;in fact, every colour; and coming in and out of your
room, are little humming-birds the size of a large bee, looking like
an emerald or a ruby flitting about, and if you have the sense not
to offer to touch them, and put a little wet sugar in a saucer, they
will stay there for days; but if you try to catch them, they break
their hearts and die. The tints of Brazil are always the tints of the
opal in fine weather. The heat is awful, like the damp heat of a
conservatory; I flourished in it.</p>

<p><i>En revanche</i>, Brazil has no history save three hundred years, which
relates its discovery and its gradual transfer from Indian natives to
the first Portuguese settlers. The Jesuits erected all the buildings
on the best sites, made roads, and cultivated; but the Indians are not
exterminated&mdash;they are only driven inwards&mdash;and about ten days
from our home our nearest Indians were the Botacudos. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
see them in the Crystal Palace with their under-lip distended by a
bit of wood. The nearest to us were friendly ones, and they would
come down to São Paulo on rare occasions. They walk in Indian
file, and when they passed our house, or any other friendly house,
they threw their arms out towards the house&mdash;as if the whole file
were pulled by a string&mdash;till they had gone by it; and that is their
mode of friendly salute. When the railway was opened, they came
down out of curiosity to see it. They looked upon the engine as
a sort of malignant beetle, but at last they got less frightened, and
all clambered upon it; but when it was time to start, and the
driver gave the preliminary whistle, they sprang off like mad, and
ran for their lives, nor could they be persuaded to mount again.</p>

<p>Another drawback was the reptiles and vermin. There is a large
mosquito that fastens its prongs into your hand. I have seen a man
let it suck, and then cut half its tail off, and it has gone on sucking
and the blood running through&mdash;the mosquito being not in the least
aware of its loss. Then there is a little grey, almost invisible, mosquito
that makes no noise. In Trieste they call them <i>papataci</i> (papa-hold-your-tongue).
There is the jigger, that gets into your flesh,
generally under your toe-nail or under the sole of your foot, and the
first time you are aware that there is anything the matter is by your
limping, and you then discover that there is a something about the
size of a pea in your foot. You send for a negress, who picks at
your foot for a few minutes with a common pin&mdash;they won't use a
needle or any other instrument, because if they did the bag would
break, and the eggs would get into your blood&mdash;and presently, with
a little hurting, she triumphantly holds it up at the end of the pin,
puts on a soothing ointment, and you are all right at once. A man
thought he should like to take a jigger home to show an English
doctor, but it was six weeks from home, and his foot was cut off
before he got there.</p>

<p>Another nuisance is the <i>carapato</i>. It is everywhere, but chiefly
inhabits the coffee plantations. There are three sorts, which only
vary in size and colour. It is a cross between a tick and a small
crab; the biggest would be the size of a little finger-nail. If you
ride through a coffee plantation you come out covered with them.
I have more than once taken off my riding habit and found my
jacket nailed to the skin from the outside; to pull them is to tear
your flesh and produce a festering wound. You have to get into a
hot bath, in which you put one or two bottles of <i>cachaça</i>, the spirit
of the country, and that clears off most of them; and if any obstinate
ones remain, you have to light a cigarette, and apply the hot end
to their tails till they wriggle their own head and shoulders out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
under your skin. Cockroaches you don't count, but you must
always look in your sleeves, and dress, and boots, for large horned
beetles or spiders or other horrors.</p>

<p>Poor W. H. Bates (the naturalist of the Royal Geographical
Society), who was a great friend of ours, was laughed at because he
spoke of spiders as big as a toy-terrier; but it is perfectly true&mdash;there
<i>are</i> such spiders, though they are not seen in towns, only out in the
forest, and they are the size of a good-sized crab. The body is
hairy, and when they are angry they kick up and throw their hairs
on you, which are poisonous. I was going to hit one, and a native
drew me back and made me run away, for, he said, "it can spring at
you, and it is instantaneous death." Richard and I did not go so
far as to believe this, unless your blood is in a very bad state, but
we did believe in its making people ill for several days. A priest
was once going to say Mass, and he took his vestment down from
the wall where it was hung up, and put it on, when he suddenly felt
something hard in the centre of his back. He called to the servers
and asked them to remove his vestment gently, without touching his
back, telling them there was something inside. They did so, and it
was one of these big spiders; when it was removed he fainted.</p>

<p>The people eat a large black ant, an inch and a half long. They
bite off the fat body, which has to them a pleasant acid, and throw
the head and legs away. Another use they make of them is to dress
them up like dolls and sell them. The <i>copim</i>, or white ants, build
nests like milestones. The people here believe in a sort of house-that-Jack-built
as regards animal feeding. They believe that toads
eat ants, that snakes eat toads, that owls eat snakes, also the geese,
and that is why they are cheap.</p>

<p>Snakes are everywhere&mdash;in your garden, in your basement, in your
rafters; and there is every description of them, from the boa-constrictor
in the wilder parts, to the smallest. It is a common
thing to hear the rattlesnake in the grass, and to scamper quickly.
Those who kill them cut out the rattle and give it you for good
luck. I have one now. At night, when you walk out you go with
a lantern at the end of a stick, for the snake called <i>jararaquassú</i> lies
curled up at night on the road, looking exactly like a heap of dust,
and you would certainly put your foot on it; it bites your ankle, and
they say that you live about ten minutes.</p>

<p>These things, which sound so wonderful in England, become so
common to us who live and travel in Brazil, out of towns and off
beaten tracks, that we get quite accustomed to them, as everyday
parts of our lives, as you do to showers in April and dying flies in
September; so that I should not know now that they had ever happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
if I had not written them down at the time. No one who
means to write, should ever trust to memory, because scene after
scene fades like a dissolving view and is never caught again, whilst
others rise to replace them.</p>

<p>The storms were another thing to be somewhat dreaded. For
our three summer months, which are December, January, and
February (whilst the Thames is frozen over in London), we, maybe,
have 115° in the shade, and you see a semicircle of clouds beating up.
As our house was on a kind of promontory running out, not to sea,
but to grassy plain, we used to have to make "all taut" as if we
were on board a ship, because when it did come it was like a cyclone,
lasting two or three hours, and then clearing off, leaving everything
bright and beautiful, the earth and air barely refreshed; but while
it lasted the thunder and lightning were close to you. I have
frequently thought that if there was one more clap my head would
split&mdash;it deafened one. The windows were generally broken, there
were balls of fire flying through the air&mdash;blue, red, yellow; and on
one occasion, on a pitch-black night, perceiving a light from an
opposite angle in my husband's room, I thought the house was on
fire. The door was locked for the night. I ran down the corridor,
unlocked the door, and, going in, found that the lightning had
broken a window and had set on fire one of my husband's large
rolling atlases on canvas, which hung from the walls. I ran back
and called him, and it made him very uncomfortable. He thought
that one of these lightning balls of fire must have done it, but there
was no aerolite or anything to show. There was no fireplace in the
room, not even a box of matches.</p>

<p>At nine p.m. on the 20th of October, a meteor fell with a loud
sound, and lit up the City of São Paulo. Martinico Prado and some
others were standing near it, and he fell insensible. It fell on the
hill near São Bemte; blue flame was seen in our house at the same
moment. It was intensely cold, but bright, beautiful weather.</p>

<p>We bought horses&mdash;one that had something of the mustang in it,
called Hawa, which always carried me, and Penha, a smaller one
from Campos for Richard. When we drove, it was in an American
buckboard, seat for two, with huge wheels, and a little place to hold
a box, with a pair of wild mules that used to pull one's arm off.
When Richard did not ride with me, Chico used to take the second
horse.</p>

<p>Chico and I never had but one quarrel, and I will give it as
an illustration. When I first arrived, Richard used always to laugh
at me, because I was so miserable at the way the cruel people treat
the blacks&mdash;just in the same way that I, and so many others, feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
about the treatment of animals&mdash;and he kept saying, "Oh, wait a bit,
till you have lived with negroes a little; you philanthropic people
always have to give in." Well, about six weeks after I got Chico, I
heard a tremendous noise, and shrieks of agony proceeding from the
kitchen, and rushing in the direction I found Chico roasting my
favourite cat at the fire. I made one spring at his wool, and brought
him to the ground. Richard, who had also rushed out at the noise,
saw me, and clapped his hands, saying, "Brava! brava! I knew it
would happen, but I did not think it would be quite so soon." I
could only blubber out, "Oh, Jemmy, the little beast has roasted
my cat." He then punished him himself, and Chico was a good boy
evermore. In begging for forgiveness, he told us that their fathers
and mothers always instructed them, that when Christ was thirsty,
if He asked a little dog for water, the dog would go and fetch it for
Him, but if He asked a cat for water, that it gave Him something in
a cup, which I cannot mention in polite society; and that all the
little negroes were taught to be cruel to cats, and that he <i>had</i> done
atrocious things to cats, but he would never do so any more.</p>

<p>A very amusing thing was that this little monkey used to imitate
his master in everything. If Richard bought a suit of clothes, he used
immediately to take it to the tailor and get it exactly copied in
small, and his evening suit especially. To go to a ball he was the
<i>exact</i> copy of his master&mdash;white shirt, white tie, little dress suit, little
<i>gibus</i>, and all. We used to make him come and show himself to us
when he was dressed, to amuse us. Then, unlike his master, he
started a toilette-table with mirror, perfumes, and scents, and his
pillow was all edged with deep lace. Each of the best families had
one of these intelligent negroes; they used to give supper-parties,
and then stand up and make speeches, just like us. Mr. Aubertin's
used to talk about the railway shares, and the value of cotton, and
the coffee produce; another, belonging to a reverend gentleman,
used to stand up and speak of the "benighted state of the souls of
the black man and the brother;" but our Chico used to declaim
on "the Negro's place in Nature," as he had heard Richard do in
his lectures, and talk of the progress that they had made from the
original ape (Darwinism), and how they might eventually hope to rise
into a white man.</p>

<p>Portuguese studies got on very well, and the more I knew of it, the
more I enjoyed myself; but it made me quite forget the Spanish I
had learnt during my stay at Teneriffe, and whilst Richard occupied
Fernando Po. Richard had always known Portuguese from his
Goanese <i>Padre</i> in India. You cannot speak Spanish, Portuguese,
and Italian at the same time; they are so alike, and yet so different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
Portuguese is the most Latin, and the most difficult of the lot, and
has much more literature to reward you with than Spanish; but
Spanish is the grandest and the most beautiful, albeit with less
literature. Still it once happened to me to be in company with a
priest, an Italian, and a Spaniard, and we agreed to talk for an
hour in each of the four languages. The priest took Latin, the
Italian and the Spaniard each their own, and I Portuguese, and we
could understand and answer each other, but we could not speak
the other three languages. Italians come out to Brazil and can only
speak Italian, not a word of Portuguese; they then come to a crisis,
when they can speak neither; they then convalesce in Portuguese,
speak it perfectly and remain with it&mdash;they forget their Italian. I
speak of colonists.</p>

<p>We had two very charming picnic-places. One was the Tropic of
Capricorn, just five miles from São Paulo; your insurances suffer all
the difference, whether you are on this side or that. A boy who was
about to pass his examination for the army, who supported a poor
widow mother, and consequently was extremely anxious about
passing, and with no interest, was destined to be plucked; so the
arrogant and ignorant examiner asked the timid, humble boy, "How
far is it from the city of São Paulo to the tropical line of Capricorn."
The boy, radiant answered, "Between four and five miles, sir." "Go
down, sir, you are plucked; it is twenty miles." It was the last
question. The boy grew red and white, and turned despairingly to
go; suddenly he remembered his mother, turned round, and said
nervously, "Please, sir, of course you ought to know better than me,
but I lived there five years, sir, and I had to walk it twice a week,
to go home from school to mother's house on the Line, from Saturday
to Monday." Chorus of laughter at the examiner, and the poor boy
passed. (I have already quoted this in my "A.E.I.") Another charming
place to picnic, in the mountains, was Nossa Senhora do O.</p>

<p>We occasionally had big dinners, when all the English of Santos
and São Paulo assembled to do honour to some railway swell going
home. We had for a time some fortnightly balls, at a good-sized
hall at the corner of the Plaza, called the Concordia, and we had
one curious case of sporadic yellow fever from there. Mrs. Ralston,
the young wife of a very nice man (indeed a charming couple), came
out of the ball-room with me at five o'clock one morning. I had
only to run across fifty yards to my house; they had about twenty
minutes to walk home, and she was well wrapped up with shawls.
She suddenly drooped her head on her husband's shoulder, saying
she felt very queer, and he had to support her home. Almost
directly he had laid her on her own bed, she turned round and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
said, "Oh, is this death?" and died. Next morning, my maid ran
in and without any preface said, "Mrs. Ralston's dead." "Oh,
nonsense," I said; "I saw her seven hours ago;" and, thinking
perhaps it was possible she might be ill, and require some woman-neighbour,
I hastily threw on my things, and ran down to her house.
The street door opened on to the principal sitting-room, and was
unlocked, and to my horror the house was deserted and still, and
something was lying covered up on the sofa. I drew back the sheet,
and there was my young friend, dead. I knelt down and said a few
prayers, and then, feeling rather faint, I stooped to kiss her forehead
before covering her up again. The husband and child and servants
had all been removed to another house; as I stooped to kiss her a
dreadful effluvia knocked me back again, and I perceived that she
was covered with large black spots. I fled and ran home again, and
told Richard. He looked very grave, and rang the bell, and ordered
the horses to the door. He fetched me a large glass of brandy, and
made me drink it, with some bread. He said, "It does not matter;
I have got to have a long ride to-day on business, and you have got
to go with me." We rode about ten miles at a great pace, till I was
in a good perspiration. When I got back he gave me a teaspoonful
of Warburg drops. He kept me employed all day, and at night he
took me to the little theatre, and then he told me that he had done
that to save my life, without which I probably should have caught it,
if I had not perspired, and partly from sympathy.</p>

<p>One thing I always regret in writing, is that I could recite so
many amusing and interesting things that would immensely please
a very large portion of English people; but England is so very queer,
and I am become convinced it is not the same England that I used
to know, that I do not like to venture them. They are not in the
least risky, only amusing and adventurous, but being very honest
and straightforward, would be sure to tread upon somebody's corns;
blame or sneers would be sure to crop up from some quarter or
another, and make me regret it. Richard was very fond of quoting
the following lines to me over our writing:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"They eat and drink and scheme and plod;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They go to church on Sunday,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And many are afraid of God,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And more of Mrs. Grundy."</span><br />
</p>

<p>We had one very curious character at São Paulo. It was the
Marchesa de Santos. She was a beauty and a favourite in the time
of the present Emperor's father, and led a very brilliant and stormy
life. She got finally banished by his Empress (they say) to Santos,
with a pension for life, and she lived in a small house a few doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
from me. I used to see a great deal of her. She was quite <i>grande
dame</i>, most sympathetic, most entertaining, full of stories of Rio
and the Court, and the Imperial people, and the doings of that time.
She had been obliged to adopt up-country habits, and the last time
I saw her, she received me <i>en intime</i> in her own kitchen, where she
sat on the floor, smoking, not a cigarette, but a pipe. She had beautiful
black eyes, full of sympathy, and intelligence, and knowledge.
She was a great bit of interest to me in that out-of-the-way place.</p>

<p>The Seminary was the most palatial building in that part, and
was just beyond the town. It was inhabited by Capuchins, French
and Italians from Savoy and Piédmont. One of the monks was a
tall, magnificent, and very powerful man, an ex-cavalry officer, Count
Somebody, whose name I forget, then Fray G&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Before he arrived, there was a bully in the town, rather of a free-thinking
class, so he used to go and swagger up and down before
the Seminary and call out, "Come out, you miserable petticoated
monks! come out and have a free fight! For God or the devil!"
When Fray G&mdash;&mdash; arrived, he heard of this, and it so happened he had
had an English friend, when he was with his regiment, who had taught
him the use of his fists. He found that his brother monks were
dreadfully distressed at this unseemly challenge, so he said, "The next
time he comes, don't open the gate, but let the porter call me." So
the next time the bully appeared, it was so arranged that the gate was
opened by Fray G&mdash;&mdash; (the usual crowd had collected in the road to
see the fun), who looked at him laughingly and said, "Surely, brother,
we will fight you for God or the devil, if you please. Let us get well
into the open, and the public will see fair play." So saying, the friar
tucked up his sleeves and gown, and told his adversary to "come
on," which he did, and he was immediately knocked into a cocked
hat. "Come, get up," said the friar. "No lying there and whimpering;
the devil won't win that way." The man stood three rounds, at
the end of which he whimpered and holloaed for mercy, and amidst
the jeers and bravos of a large crowd, the "village cock" retired, a
mass of jelly and pulp, to his own dunghill, and was never seen more
within half a mile of the Seminary. Richard rejoiced in it, and used
to say, "What is that bull-priest doing in that <i>galère</i>?" Richard used
to stay a great deal with them, for they were the best-educated men
in the province, and knew everything. He said he could always
learn something from them.</p>

<p>During the time of the Paraguayan War provisions were very
scarce. If muleteers came down to the town, they and their mules
were seized for the war. They tried sending their women down with
the mules, but then the mules and provisions were seized; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
consequence was that the towns were more or less in a state of famine.
Chico and I used to sally forth, with paniers and ropes to our saddles,
and forage about, and I found that by riding about ten miles out, I
came to large flocks of geese and other poultry, and I also ascertained
that as the geese were supposed to feed upon snakes, nobody ate
them; they were chiefly kept for ornament, and so were cheap.
So the first day I came back with both our horses laden with geese,
and as I passed through the town the squawking was immense;
and most of the Grundy, respectable English tried to avoid me,
which made me take an especial pleasure in riding up to them and
inquiring after their wives and families, and entering into a conversation,
which I, perhaps, should not have otherwise done. When
I got up to our house, Richard, hearing the noise, came out on to
the balcony, and seeing what was the matter, he threw back his
head and laughed, and shook his fist, and he said, "Oh, you
delightful blackguard, how like you!" I turned the geese into our
poultry-yard and fed them well, and from that, I issued forth to all
the country round about, twice a week, and brought in various
stocks of other provisions.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubertin, who was the Head of the railway, and whose
<i>chacara</i> was about a quarter of an hour from us, had opportunities
of getting up drinks and having a very tidy cellar, so I used to
send down a neighbourly note&mdash;"Dear Mr. Aubertin, bring up
the drink&mdash;I have got the food; dinner seven o'clock." Thus we
contrived between us, to feed very well during the whole of the war,
while provisions were scarce. Once we managed to give a ball; it was
very amusing, and it was kept up till sunrise. We had a delightful
American there, who was very witty, and used to keep us all alive,
though in after years, for some unknown reason, he blew his brains
out. I still recall some of his <i>bon mots</i>. I once asked him whether
he did not think that a gentleman of our acquaintance was very conceited
this morning. "Conceited, ma'am?" he said. "Why, God
Almighty's waistcoat would not fit him." On another occasion, there
was a rather pronounced flirtation going on, and I asked him if he
did not think it would be a case. "A case, ma'am? Why, she nestles
up to him like a chicken to a hot brick." He was constantly saying
these things that one never forgot.</p>

<p>I think I may say in our own favour, that in this, as well as in all
our subsequent Consulates, we never allowed any scandal to be
told to us, or uncharitable talk, and we always forbid discussions on
religion and politics, which served us in good stead in all our career.
Indeed, in this particular place, there <i>was</i> a little bit of scandal, and
we had seventeen calls on one Monday morning, but every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
went away without daring to deliver themselves of their intended
tale. "What is the meaning of this?" said Richard to me. I said,
"It means that there is some scandal afloat, and nobody dares tell
it to us." But a few days afterwards we saw it in the papers. One
day a gentleman called upon us, and a few minutes later a lady
came, of whom he was rather fond. After a while the lady got up
and went down the street, and about five minutes after the jealous
husband arrived on the scene, and saw the gentleman sitting there&mdash;his
supposed rival. Without saying "How do you do?" he turned
on me and said, "Have you seen my wife?" "Yes," I said; "I saw
her go down the street a few minutes ago." The lover had turned
very pale. Richard looked hard at me over the top of his newspaper,
and the man had hardly got down the stairs in pursuit of his wife,
when my Irish maid poked her face through the door and said.
"Well, after that, ye'd swear a hole through a tin p-hot." Now, what
on earth would have been the use of making a row and a scandal,
and setting on the husband to ill-treat his wife? He did not say,
"Has my wife been here?"&mdash;he said, "Have you seen her?"
Rousseau says, "Mensonge plein d'honnêteté, de fidelité, de generosité,
tandis que la verité n'eut été qu'une perfidie;" and without some
feeling of this kind&mdash;not a lie, but a harmless throwing one's self into
the breach to save another's reputation, not one's own, nor from base
fear&mdash;the milk of human kindness would turn into cream of tartar.</p>

<p>I do not think that a list of the aboriginal tribes of Brazil at
the time of its discovery (one hundred discovered by Cabral in 1500)
would amuse my readers, or fit in with my subject, but they were
mostly destroyed or driven inwards in three hundred and sixty-seven
years.</p>

<p>There is an intervening race called the Caboclas; they are the
progeny of the Indians and Portuguese settlers. They are a very handsome
race, much addicted to superstition and fortune-telling, and the
only thing I can remember was learning from them to tell fortunes
by the cards, which I afterwards perfected amongst the Mogháribehs
in Syria; but it is a practice which, though it interested my husband
enormously, and I constantly told them for him, I have long since
given up as wicked. For those who tell them ill, it is foolery; for
those who tell them well, it is better let alone.</p>

<p>I am not going to give a description of Brazil, because by so doing
I should take away from the subject of the book, which is solely
Richard Burton, and if I mention incidents, or myself, it is only
because I or they are woven up with his life, and cannot well be
separated from it, each one showing how he behaved, or what he did
or thought on any particular occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>The 14th of February was the opening day of the railway, as far as
Jundiahy, and this time we were invited and had a very gay time.</p>

<p>Here, in São Paulo, Richard worked hard at Camoens, and we both
worked together at our translations&mdash;"Iraçema, or Honey-lips," and
"Manuel de Moraes, the Convert," and the "Uruguay," all from
great Brazilian authors; but we found, although we printed the two
first, that they were not well received in England, because they were
translations, and I could write a page or two upon the amount of
literature and education we lose by boycotting that of other countries.</p>

<p>In spring of 1867 there was fighting in the streets for a couple of
nights, about the election time.</p>

<p>The staple food of the people of the country, which takes the place
of what the potato would be to the Irish, is a savoury mess of small
brown beans, called <i>fejão;</i> a very coarse flour, called <i>farinha</i>,
which looks like a dish of shaved horse-radish, is usually sprinkled
over the beans, and then it is called a <i>fejoada</i>. It is delicious, and I
should have been quite content to, and often did, dine on it.
Another favourite dish is a scone of <i>milho</i>, the full-grown Indian
corn, made hot and buttered. The only way to eat it, is to take it
up in your two hands and gnaw it up and down like a bone, which
is rather disagreeable, because it covers you with butter. A pepper-pot
is also a usual thing, and is kept up <i>à perpétuité;</i> it comes on
the table in its native earthenware pot, and everybody takes a little
bit at the end to digest dinner, in lieu of cheese. Of course
Europeans have their own dishes besides.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty that I found was, that I was obliged to have
five relays of every meal. First of all, Richard and I sat down, and
our guests, if we had any; after we left the table, succeeded my Irish
maid, who had become Donna Maria, and an Irish brother that she
had imported, who was very like the "Mulligan" in "Perkinses' ball,"
and for whom I was fortunate enough to get a good berth on the
railway at £200 a year, through the kindness of Mr. Daniel Fox and
Mr. Aubertin, and he rose to £600 in course of time, traded, but
unfortunately died after some years. After these the food was
removed to some other room, where the German servants dined,
because they would not sit down with the blacks. When they had
finished the emancipated slaves sat down, who would not sit down
with the slaves; these being too near their own kind, they obliged
them to stand or to sit on the floor in the corners, where they gave
them the leavings. But do not let anybody imagine that the slaves
suffered, because when they had been about three months with me,
from having had a little rice at their old masters', they would
sometimes clamour for ducks and chickens, not being content with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
the good meat and bread and everything else that they got in
plenty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Life_at_Rio"></a>Life at Rio.</i></div>

<p>At Rio we met with a very funny and interesting man&mdash;a
certain Dr. Gunning, with a kind good wife. They lived in a pretty
cottage somewhere along the rail up in the forests, and we went to
spend a day or two with them. He was a tall gaunt Scotchman,
with a good deal of character, and some very curious ideas. He
used to do what some people did with horses in Trieste. He used
to buy up diseased and useless negroes, treat them well, feed them
up, cure them, and then make them work for him; so he got their
labour in return for his outlay and his kindness and trouble, and he
left in his desk their papers of manumission. Unfortunately, one
day in a soft moment he told them so, so the next night they shot
him; but as his skull was a good hard one it only gave him a wound,
and after that he went on some different tack with them.</p>

<p>He had a curious way of treating snake-bites, of which many thousands
die during the year. He told us this himself. He said, "When I
am called to attend a negro for a snake-bite, I cauterize the wound,
and tie a ligature, and then I give him an awful thrashing, and," he said,
"that counteracts the torpor or sleep, produces perspiration, and
stimulates the action of the heart; and then I give him spirits or
milk in large quantities." However, we all liked him very much. One
of the nicest things at Rio was the bathing in the sea. We used to go
out of a little gate at the bottom of the garden, and walk along the
beach till we came to some circular rocks which acted as bathing-machines,
where we could undress, get into the sea and bathe, and
come back. In my time there were no bathing-machines in Brazil,
only sometimes it was very rough and very deep, and one had to be
on the look-out. One day I put my maid to sit upon my clothes,
and thought I would swim out to a log of wood, lying apparently
about a hundred yards off, when to my horror I saw it move.
I swam back for my life, where I found my maid in deadly terror;
and, looking, we saw it was a shark, and a good big one too.</p>

<p>One thing that made staying at Rio so very pleasant was the
great kindness of the Emperor and Empress to us. The Emperor
delighted in scientific men, and the Empress liked good Catholics,
so that we were frequently sent for&mdash;Richard alone to the Emperor,
and I alone to the Empress, or both together. Richard gave two
lectures at which all the Imperial family attended. The Imperial
family consisted of the Emperor and Empress, the Imperial Princess
Isabel, heir to the throne, her husband the Count d'Eu, and the
Duke and Duchess de Saxe. These last, however, were less known,
less cordial, and less popular in Rio. I can remember on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
occasion, when we were sent for to an audience, at which were
present the Emperor and Empress, the Princess Isabel and her
husband, her Majesty's little dog came in and sat on the rug in
the centre of the circle, and sat up begging. They all burst out
laughing very heartily. The Emperor was a tall, handsome, fair
man, with blue eyes, and brimful of kindness and learning. The
Empress was not handsome, but she was the kindest and best of
Empresses&mdash;very devout, dressed very plainly, but was most imperial
in her manners and carriage. The Princess also had the manner
of her rank, and was soft and sweet. The Princess Isabel used to
give balls every Monday fortnight during the season, to which all
persons entitled to go to Court were invited. One night, at one of
Princess Isabel's balls, the Emperor walked up to Richard and said,
"How is it, Captain Burton, that you are not dancing?" "I never
dance, your Majesty&mdash;that is, not often; but the last time I did so, it
was with the King of Dahomè, to the music of cutting off heads&mdash;in
pantomime, of course." The Emperor laughed, and he said, "The
best of it was, Sir, that the authorities at home were in an awful rage
with me, as her Majesty's Commissioner, for dancing with him; but
I should like to have seen <i>them</i> refuse his dusky Majesty, when, at a
single moment of impatience or irritability, he had only got to give
a sign, to have fifty spears run into one, or to be instantly impaled."</p>

<p>It was very pretty to see the Princess and her husband go
down to the door, the street door, and receive and kiss the hands
of the Emperor and Empress. They circulated freely amongst us,
and talked to us. The Empress would draw her chair over to me
or to any other lady that she had a fancy to talk to, and sit down
and chat as affably as any other great lady without ever abating one
little bit of her Imperial dignity.</p>

<p>I remember one night Richard and I were giving a large dinner
to nearly all the Diplomatic corps at the hotel, after the reception
at the palace. At the latter there was a room for the Ministers to
wait in, and a room for the Consuls. We were, of course, put
into the Consular room. Presently a messenger came and took us
into the Ministers' room. This rather offended official etiquette,
and <i>they</i> said, "Oh, you must not come here; you must go into the
Consuls' room." "But," we said, "we have just been fetched out of
the Consuls' room and put in here, so we do not know what to do."
There was an immense long wait, and several times a messenger
came to let in somebody else, and we all stood up in our places,
expecting the Emperor. After a long time, when everybody was
getting very impatient, a messenger arrived, and said, "This way."
They all flocked to the door, and we hung back, thinking we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
not have audience with the Ministers. Then the messenger said, "No,
no! not for you, gentlemen, but Captain and Mrs. Burton." The
poor humble people were exalted; their Majesties had sent for us to
their private drawing-rooms, and gave us a long sitting-down audience.
As we were driving home, Richard said, "I am afraid all the other
fellows will be awfully angry;" and the fact of the matter is, that
though we waited dinner for a long time, there were a great many
empty chairs that night, which disappointed us sorely; but they
were all right next morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Barra_for_contrast"></a>The Barra for contrast.</i></div>

<p>Whenever we were sickly we used to go down to the Barra, near
Santos, which I described before as our fashionable watering-place,
where somebody generally lent us a hut. We used to sit in the
water and let it roll over us, and walk about without our shoes and
stockings (there was not a soul to see us). We took to making
collections of butterflies, reptiles, snakes, and ferns, of which
there are some four thousand specimens; the orchids we used to
send home. I can recollect on some occasions, being down there
alone, and being asked to dinner about a mile and a half along the
sands from my hut, I used to put my dress and my shoes and
stockings up in a parcel, and mounting barefooted, with waterproof
on, ride the small pony lent to me; sometimes I used to have to get
down and lead him through the streams that were rushing to the sea,
to which he had a dislike; so we used to wade through, and then I
would get up and ride him on to the next one, and when we reached
the hospitable door I was conducted into a room to put on my shoes
and stockings and my dinner dress. However, we were not <i>décolleté</i>,
nor did we wear flowers or diamonds on that lonely coast.</p>

<p>Whenever we went down to Rio, it always meant a great deal of
gaiety with the Diplomats and the Squadron, and receptions at the
palace. It was especially gay in Sir Edward and Lady Thornton's
reign, and I think we all look back to that time as a happy and a
very pleasant and lively one.</p>

<p>One of the great charms of Rio, was our little club, numbering
about twenty-five intimates, all belonging either to the Diplomatic
corps or the Navy. We used to give each other some very nice
dinner-parties, and ours was by necessity at the hotel; we mostly
dined together at one house or the other every night. Then,
besides the frequent palace entertainments, was the Alcazar, where
there was a charming French troupe, of which the star was Mdlle.
Aimée, and we used to have all Offenbach's music and operas.</p>

<p>One time we went up to Robeio and to Ubá, the end of the
railway, and I was given a treat to go on the engine and drive it,
with the engine-driver by me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="To_the_Mines_in_Minas_Geraes"></a>To the Mines in Minas Gerães.</i></div>

<p>On the 12th of June we started on a delightful Expedition. We
sailed in a steam launch across the Bay of Rio, which is like a
beautiful broad lake studded with islands and boulder rocks and
bordered by mountains. Two hours brings you to a rickety wharf,
where a little railway, running for eleven miles through a mangrove
flat, lands you at the foot of the mountains. Here a carriage waits
for you, drawn by four mules, and you commence a zigzag ascent for
two hours up these most regal mountains, and arrive at a table-land
some distance from the summit, where the small white settlement
called Petropolis lies. It is a German town with Swiss valleys,
pretty views, rides, and drives. The Cascadinha leads down a winding
path, or a steep wooded mountain, and as you reach its depths,
facing you from opposite, comes the body of water frothing and
bounding over the boulders. From the top of the Serra there
is a lovely panorama of Rio and its bay, seen as from an inverted
arch of mountains. The little settlement of Petropolis possesses a
theatre, a Catholic church, the Emperor's palace, and two small
hotels; the Court of Ministers and the Diplomats have snuggeries
here, and form a pleasant society. The climate is fine and cold when
it does not rain, and the scattered houses are like Italian <i>cascine</i>.</p>

<p>Here we took coach, which is very much after the fashion
of the old diligence, and we drove to Juizdafora. These coaches
are drawn by perfectly wild mules; they stand straight on their hind
legs. While the passengers are getting in, the coachman is already
mounted with reins and whip, and two or three men hang on to
each mule. When all is ready the driver shouts "Larga!" The men
fall back and the mules rush on at full gallop, swaying the coach
from side to side. After three months, when the mules are trained
and tamed down, they are pronounced no longer fit for their work,
and are sold for carriage-driving.<a name="FNanchor_2_150" id="FNanchor_2_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_150" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> My pleasant recollection of
Juizdafora is of lying all day on the grass under the orange trees,
and picking about nine different species overhead, just within reach
of my arms. I have never tasted oranges equal, before or since.
We then started for Barbaçena, which terminated the coach journey.
After this there was no means of getting along except on horseback.
We had to discard our boxes and leave them under the care of a
trustworthy person, and to make up a pack that we could carry
behind us on our saddles, such as a change of linen, tooth-brush, a
cake of soap, and a comb. We then mounted and rode twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
miles to Barrozo, a small village with a ranch. We rose at three
next morning, and rode twenty-four miles further, and so on, and so
on, till we reached San João d'El Rey, where we saw the Mines.
We then went on to S. José. Our next place was Cerandahy to
Lagos Dourado; here we met a party of English engineers.</p>

<p>On the 24th&mdash;a great feast, St. John Baptist&mdash;they were laying
the foundation for a new railway, and we enjoyed the fun very much.
We then, after breakfasting by a brook with the engineers, rode on
to an awful place called Camapuão. Here we found the stables better
than the house, and we slept by the side of the mules and horses.
At one of these shelters that we asked to sleep at, the accommodation
was fearful, but the reception was kind and cordial. There was
not much to eat. In the middle of the night I woke, and could
hear loud hoarse whisperings through the thin partition wall; it
sounded like the man and his wife disputing. At length I heard the
man say distinctly, "Don't bother me any more; it will be quite easy
to kill them both, and I mean to do it." My hair stood on an end,
as the saying is, and I softly got up and walked on tiptoe over to
Richard, touched him, and said in a whisper, "Hush! don't speak;
I have something to tell you." I told him exactly what I had heard.
He said, "You will make less noise than I; go softly to that table and
take our weapons, hand me mine, and creep into bed with yours. We
will sit and watch the door. If it opens, I'll let fly at the door; and if
a second comes in, then <i>you</i> fire." However, nothing came, though
we lay awake till daylight, with our pistols cocked. Next morning
they brought us for our breakfast a couple of nice roast chickens,
and he said, "My wife and I had a regular quarrel in the night; we
had only these two hens, and <i>she</i> did not want to kill them, but
we had nothing else, and I was determined that you should have
them both." So we said to him, "You shall not lose anything by it."
Nor did they, for we paid four times the value; but we were glad
when he went out of the room, that we might laugh.</p>

<p>Next day we rode on to Sassuhy, to Congonhas do Campo, about
twenty-two miles. We saw the church of Congonhas and the seven
stations of the Cross. We left at midday, and riding through a
difficult country, arrived at Teixeiros. Next day was a very hard
day. We started at half-past three in the morning; at half-past ten
we breakfasted under a tree by the river. We crossed different
rivers about twelve times, wading our horses through. We passed
through virgin forests, and up and down scarped rocky mountains
till dark, and arrived at Corche d'Agua, a miserable place, where there
were no beds or food. We started again before dawn, rode about twelve
miles in the dark, passed two villages, and about nine a.m. arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
Morro Velho, our destination, where we were most kindly received
by Mr. and Mrs. Gordon and family (Superintendent of all the
Mines), and soon had bath and breakfast, and our animals quartered
in good stables under the care of the host's English groom.</p>

<p>Here we stayed with our kind host for five and a half weeks,
making excursions, and seeing most interesting things concerning
the Mines. The Establishment consisted of the Superintendent and
his family, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, two sons, and two daughters, and
twenty-five officers (English); under them, about three thousand
negroes (slaves), who work the mines. On Sunday we went to their
church, saw their hospital and the stables, which contained some
sixty horses, and we saw an Indian dance.</p>

<p>Here there was much of interest&mdash;the muster of the slaves, and
pay-day on Saturday. We saw baptisms, and marriages, and burials.
We went to see the quicksilver washed in the amalgamation house,
and Mr. William Crookes's amalgamation; but this last did not
succeed.</p>

<p>We started again after we were rested, passing through interesting
mining places, sleeping the night at a friendly <i>fazenda</i>; next day we
rode on to S. José de Morra Grande, Barro, Brumado, Santa Barbara,
and Cates Atlas. There we slept. Next morning we rode to Agua,
Queule, Fonseca, Morreia, and Affeixonada; from thence to Benito
Rodriguez, then Comargo, then S. Anna, and then Marianna.
Here we slept, went to church, visited the Bishop, the Seminary,
the Sisters of Charity, hospitals, orphanage, and schools, and rode
to Passagem, where we slept. Next day we went down the Passagem
mines (gold), forty-five fathoms down, and in another place thirty-two
fathoms, and saw the stamps; and then we went and did the same
at the S. Anna mines. This day we were so near Mr. Treloar's
house, that we gave away all our provisions, saying, "By breakfast-time
to-morrow we shall be in a English house." Imagine our horror,
on arriving, to find that poor Mrs. Treloar had died the evening
before, and that her poor husband was in such a state that it was
impossible for him to receive us. He thanked God for Richard's
coming, because there was no church, no clergyman, and no
burial-ground, and an English Consul performing the burial service
is valid; so the sorrowful ceremony was performed, winding up the
hill-top, where she was buried, and I was left in charge of all his
negroes. They had prepared something for us to eat, for which I
had given them five <i>milreis</i>, about ten shillings. They all squabbled
so violently over this, as to draw their knives, and to begin to stab
each other; so, with that ascendency which whites generally have
over blacks, I ordered them all to come into my presence and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
put their knives down near me, and I asked them if they were not
ashamed, when their poor mistress was being carried up the hill to
her last burial-place, to behave in so unseemly a fashion, and, ordering
them all down upon their knees, I took out my Prayer-book and
read the burial service too; and I read it over and over again, until
the party came back from the grave.</p>

<p>We then started immediately for Ouro Preto. Here Richard
went up the Itacalumi, and I visited the two martyrs of Ouro Preto,
the house of Gonzaga. We then slept and dined, and had champagne,
and we went to tea at Mr. and Mrs. Spiers', who had a party.
Next day we rode on to Casa Branca, S. Vicente, to Rio das Pedras,
where we joined some American emigrants. Afterwards we had a
very weary and hard ride to Corele d'Agua, our old sleeping-place,
where we took a cup of coffee and rode to S. Antonio. We had a
pelting rain, and we breakfasted at a <i>troupeiro's</i> ranch; thence to
S. Rita, and from thence to Morro Velho, six leagues away, arriving
like wet dogs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_go_down_the_Big_Mine"></a>We go down the Big Mine.</i></div>

<p>On the 24th of July we went down the big mine at Morro Velho.
Now, this was a great event; few men visitors had been down, and
no woman. I forget the positive depth of it, but am under the
impression <i>now</i> that it was three-quarters of a mile straight down
into the bowels of the earth, including the last thirty-five fathoms
to the depths. We were dressed in miners' dresses, with the usual
candle in our caps, and we got into a basket like a caldron hanging
to the end of a long chain, and then we began to descend.
It seemed an eternity, going down, down, and down, and of all the
things we ever have done, it seemed to me that it was the one that
required the most pluck, so dark, so cold, and slimy it looked, and
yet suffocating, and if anything happened, you felt that ne'er an arm
or leg would ever be found; it realized more than any amount of
sermons could do "the bottomless pit." The chain had broken a
little while before, and we had seen the poor smashed negroes brought
up, and it did break the next day, but <i>our time was not yet come</i>. I
have got the broken link of that chain now; Mr. Gordon gave it to
me, and it is my one relic of those days. After an apparently interminable
time we began to see lights below, at a great distance, as
you see a seaport town from a mountain as you come down at
night, and by-and-by we began to hear voices, and finally we touched
ground, and were heartily received by those who had previously
gone down to take care of us, including Mr. Gordon himself. They
gave us a hearty cheer. We were shown all over the mine, and all
its workings, and I must say I think Dante must have seen a similar
place wherewith to make his Inferno.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Richard's Account<a name="FNanchor_3_151" id="FNanchor_3_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_151" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of going down the Mine.</span></h4>


<blockquote>

<p>"A small crowd of surface workmen accompanied us to the mouth
of Walker's inclined plane, a hot and unpleasant hole leading to the
Cachoeira Mine. The negret Chico gave one glance at the deep
dark pit, wrung his hands, and fled the Tophet, crying that nothing
in the wide, wide world would make him enter such an Inferno. He
had lately been taught that he is a responsible being, with an 'immortal
soul,' and he was beginning to believe it in a rough theoretical
way: this certainly did not look like a place 'where the
good niggers go.' Next the descent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Presently the bucket was suspended over the abyss, and we
found in it a rough wooden seat, comfortable enough. We were
advised by the pitmen not to look downwards, as the glimmer of
sparks and light-points moving about in the mighty obscure below
causes giddiness and sea-sickness. We did look down, however,
and none of us suffered from the trial. More useful advice was to
keep head and hands well within the bucket, especially when passing
the up-going tub. We tipped and tilted half over only once against
a kibble-way drum, placed to fend off the <i>cacamba</i>. We had three
such collisions, which made us catch at the chains, and describe them
as 'moments of fearful suspense;' we had been lowered in a kibble
with a superfluity of chain.</p>

<p>"When our eyesight had become somewhat feline we threw a
glance round. Once more the enormous timbering under a bar, or
to the east of the shaft, called it to every one's attention."</p></blockquote>

<p>After describing the great extent of the mine, whose vertical
height was 1134 feet, and breadth 108 feet, "unparalleled in the
annals of mining," and which suggested "a cavern, a huge stone
quarry, a mammoth cave raised from the horizontal to the perpendicular,"
the narrative winds up as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">On nearing the Bottom.</span></h4>


<blockquote>

<p>"And now, looking west, the huge palace of darkness, dim in
long perspective, wears a tremendous aspect; above, at first only,
there seemed to be a sky without an atmosphere. The walls were
either as black as the grave or reflected slender rays of light glancing
from the polished watery surface, or were broken into monstrous
projections, half revealing and half concealing the cavernous, gloomy
recesses. Despite the lamps, the night pressed upon us, as it were,
with a weight, and the only measure of distance was a spark here
and there, glimmering like a single star. Distinctly Dantesque was
the gulf between the huge mountain sides apparently threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
every moment to fall. Everything, even the accents of a familiar
voice, seemed changed; the ear was struck by the sharp click and
dull thud of the hammer upon the boring-iron, and this upon the
stone; each blow invariably struck was to keep time with the wild
chants of the borer. The other definite sounds, curiously complicated
by an echo, which seemed to be within reach, were the slush
of water on the subterranean paths, the rattling of the gold-stone
thrown into the kibbles, and the crash of chain and bucket.</p>

<p>"Through this Inferno gnomes and kobolds glided about in ghostly
fashion&mdash;half-naked figures muffled up by the mist. Here dark
bodies, gleaming with beaded heat-drops, hung in what seemed
frightful positions; there they swung like Leotard from place to
place; there they swarmed up loose ropes like the Troglodytes;
there they moved over scaffolds, which even to look up at would
make a nervous temperament dizzy. This one view amply repaid
us. It was a place&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Where thoughts were many, and where words were few.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>But the effect will remain upon the mental retina as long as our
brains do their duty. At the end of two hours we left this
cathedral'd cavern of thick-ribbed gold, and we were safely got out
like ore to grass.</p>

<p>"We found the last eighty-three fathoms of tunnel steep and dark,
but dry and comfortable. It was well timbered with beams and
Candeia trunks wherever the ceiling required propping. At length
we reached another vaulted cavern, thirty-five fathoms of perpendicular
depth. It was lit up with torches, and the miners&mdash;all slaves,
directed by white overseers&mdash;streamed with perspiration, and merrily
sung their wild songs and chorus, keeping time with the strokes of
hammer and drill. The heavy gloom, the fitful glare, and the savage
chant, with the wall hanging like the stone of Cisyphus, like the sword
of Damocles, suggested a sort of material Swedenborgian hell; and
accordingly the negret Chico faltered out, when asked his opinion
on our return, 'Parece o Inferno!'"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Below"></a>Below.</i></div>

<p>To continue my account. There were the large dark halls with
vaults and domes; they were covered with negroes, each with a
candle stuck in his black head, hammering in time to some tune
to which they were all singing. It would have been a wonderful
picture for a painter. How often all my life I have regretted not
to have been an artist, instead of musical! The negroes are healthy
and well doing; they only work eight hours a day, and have over-pay
for anything extra. The mulattoes were the most surly looking
ones. After having seen everything we ascended again, and if I
may say so, I think the ascent was worse than the going down, and
nobody knows, until they have tried that sort of darkness, what daylight
and sunlight and fresh air mean. After long mounting, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
see at last one star sparkling in the distance like an eye, which
appears miles off, and that is the mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a concert and a ball amongst ourselves.
On the 27th Richard lectured; there were some private theatricals
in which I took a part, and forgetting the drop behind the open-air,
theatre when I backed off, I fell. I sprained my ankle so badly that
my leg was all black, and I could not move. Now, the worst of it
was that we were going to canoe down the San Francisco river, to
come out at the falls of Paulo Affonso, issuing at Bahía, and back
to Rio by steamer; but it was impossible to take a woman who could
not walk. We could embark at Sabará, a short distance from where
we were, and as Richard's time was very short, and he could not
take a lame woman, he had to start without me, and I went in the
litter to see him embark in the boat <i>Elisa</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as I got well, Mr. Gordon, who was an exceedingly
liberal, large-minded man, recognized that having three thousand
Catholic negroes under him, manned by twenty-five English Protestant
officers, it was quite possible that in a religious sense, things
might be made more comfortable to them, and he asked me, as an
educated English Catholic, to go the rounds of Church and Hospital,
and find out if there was anything that could improve their condition.
Having been for some time in Brazil, and seeing the wants
of the negroes, I thought I could put my finger on the right spot at
once. There was one particular ward in the hospital where incurables
were put, and a black cross over their beds told them Dante's old
words, "Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch' entrate" ("Leave every hope
(outside), all ye who enter (here)"). I dismissed the attendant, for
fear they should be afraid to answer, walked round the wards and
sat by them, and I will take one case as a specimen of the whole.
She was dying of diseases which need not be named here. I said
to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has your case been given over by the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Alas! yes," she said; "I have only got to wait."</p>

<p>"Should you like to live?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I should."</p>

<p>"Has the priest been to hear your confession? Have you sent
for him?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; I should not dare do that."</p>

<p>"Why not? What is he for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lady, we must not <i>ask</i>, and he doesn't come to us in <i>this</i>
ward, only to those who go to church."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that none of you in this ward get the
last Sacraments?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh no; we should be so ashamed to see his Reverence."</p>

<p>"Why, you are not ashamed to see the doctor? What is the
difference between the doctor and the priest, except that one is
for your body and one is for your soul? You say you are afraid
of the priest; will you not be more ashamed of God, whose servant
he is?" That seemed to strike them; so, wishing them good-bye,
I trotted off to the <i>Padre</i>. No matter his name, but he appeared
to take things very easy when I told him. He said he "could not
administer the Sacraments, because he had not a pyx nor any of the
vessels to convey them in."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "Father, I have been commissioned by the
Superintendent to examine into these things, and to report to him
what <i>is</i> done and what <i>ought</i> to be done, and he is going to see
it carried out; so will you oblige me by going to hear all those
confessions, <i>now at once</i>, and taking the holy ingredients in a wine-glass,
and administering Viaticum and Extreme Unction, and say
a few consoling words to them, and let us see the results? You
know that you can break these glasses into little atoms, and you
can burn the remnants in one of the furnaces, or keep them for that
purpose until I send up the proper things from Rio."</p>

<p>Well, this was done, and, to cut a long story short, that woman
was back to work in a fortnight; and when Mr. Gordon saw the
immense advantage produced by relief of mind, and the consideration
of their feelings, and the action of the brain upon the body,
he made it an institution, and commissioned me to send up all the
necessary things from Rio.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Chico_and_I_start_on_a_Fifteen_Days_Ride_alone"></a>Chico and I start on a Fifteen Days' Ride alone.</i></div>

<p>As soon as I was well enough for a long ride, Mr. Gordon supplied
me with horses&mdash;one for me, one for Chico, and one for our
small baggage&mdash;a sail and a few poles to make a tent in the day,
a gypsy-kettle on three prongs, a bag of maize for the horses, and
rice and other things for ourselves, and taking an affectionate leave
of the whole company there, and especially my kind host and family,
whom we have always remembered with the sincerest affection, and
sadness too, for poor Mrs. Gordon died eventually from a horrible
shock (her youngest and favourite son was caught in the machinery
in an instant and ground to death&mdash;a subject too sad to dwell
upon), I commenced my long ride home&mdash;a very pleasant ride.</p>

<p>I rose at dawn; we made some tea in our kettle. Replenishing
our sack of provisions at every village, and having fed, watered,
and groomed the horses, we rode until it was too hot. We put
up our bit of sail and rested during the heat, and then we rode on
till nightfall; after this we fed again, looked after the horses and
picketed them. Some of the country, and especially the forests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
were lovely. Whenever we came to a village or a ranch, we and
our animals got housed; and when we did not, which was rare,
we camped out, for it was very warm. We never met with a single
scrap of danger the whole way, nor a rude word; for defence we
had only a penknife, our toasting-fork, and an old pistol that would
not go off. I had given my weapons to Richard, whose journey was
longer and more dangerous than mine.</p>

<p>At one place that we stopped at, we rose at half-past three, and
whilst dressing I heard what I supposed was thrashing out grain
or beating sacks. It went on for about fifteen minutes, and I did
not pay any attention to it, till at last I heard a sob issue from
the beaten mass at the other side of the thin partition wall. I knew
then what was taking place, and turned so sick I could hardly get
to the door. I ran to the room, caught hold of the man's arms,
and called for Chico and for everybody in the place, but I was
fully ten minutes before I could arouse any one's pity or sympathy;
they seemed so used to it they would not take the trouble to get
up. The man who was beating only laughed, and beat on. I very
nearly fainted. I expected the poor wretch would have been
pounded to an ointment, but to my surprise, when he gave it a
kick and told it to get up, up rose quite a fine young woman, gave
herself a shake, and walked off like a Newfoundland dog. I went
after her, and asked her if she was hurt, and she said, "Oh no,
not much; he often goes on like that!" "But then," I said, "what
did he do it for? What did <i>you</i> do?" She said, "Another black
woman and I were quarrelling, so he thrashed us both; but as you
were sound asleep you did not hear the first."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Landlord_of_the_Hotel_is_mystified"></a>The Landlord of the Hotel is mystified.</i></div>

<p>We arrived in Rio about the fifteenth day. I had never enjoyed
anything more; but as I had been out for three months without
any change of clothes, I was a very curious object to look at, to say
nothing of my face and hands being the colour of mahogany. I
had been told before getting in that the Estrangeiros, where I had
left my maid and baggage, was full, so I waited till night, and then
went straight to the next best hotel in the town. The landlord
naturally did not recognize me, and he pointed to a little place on
the other side of the street, where sailors' wives went, and he said,
"I think that will be about your place, my good woman, not here."
"Well," I said, "I think I am coming in here all the same." So,
wondering, he took me upstairs and showed me his rooms; but I
was so mighty particular, that it was not till I got to his best rooms
that I stopped and said, "This will do. Be kind enough to send
up this letter for me to the Estrangeiros."</p>

<p>Presently down came my maid, who was a great swell, with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
boxes. After a bath and dressing, I rang the bell and ordered some
supper. He came up himself, as I was such an object of curiosity.
When he saw me again he said, "Did that woman come to take the
apartments for you, madam? I do beg your pardon; I am afraid I
was rather rude to her." "Well," I said, "I am that woman myself;
but you need not apologize, because I saw myself in the glass, and I
don't wonder at it." He nearly tumbled down, and when I had explained
my adverse circumstances to him, begged my pardon till I was
quite tired of hearing it. I went up to Santos for some time; and when
I thought Richard could arrive, I went down to Rio to meet him, and
used to go on board every steamer that came in from Bahía in the
hopes of his being there. At this time came out to Rio Mr. Wilfrid
Blunt and his sister Alice. I went on board ship after ship to meet
Richard, but as he never came, I got at last very anxious and miserable,
and only used to make a fool of myself by crying when I did
not find him. He had been gone over four months. At last the
first steamer that I did <i>not</i> go to meet, he arrived in, and was quite
angry to find that I was not on board to meet him. He had had
a very jolly journey, canoeing down the river to the "falls of the
Paulo Affonso," and sleeping at different ranches on the banks of
the river. It was something like fifteen hundred miles, coming out
eventually at Bahía, where he had a great friend, an old gentleman
popularly known as "Charley Williams," who gave him hospitality
till he embarked, or could catch a steamer to Rio. We then went
down to Santos together.</p>

<p>As Richard was canoeing down the San Francisco river, he found
a lot of stones called Pingua d'Agua; they are formed by congealed
rain in the rocks; they get fossilized, and if polished have the glitter
of diamonds. Richard met an Englishman, who told him that he
had come over with all he had in the world, £1500, and expended
it in diamonds, of which he fondly believed he had got about
£30,000 worth, and was going home with them. So Richard told
him that he had just come from the diamond mines, and that he
should immensely like to see them. When he showed them to him,
Richard's face fell, and he said, "What is the matter?" "Well,"
he said, "I hardly like to tell you, but I am afraid you have been
done. Some one has passed off these Pingua d'Agua upon you for
diamonds, and I am afraid you have exchanged £1500 for thirty
shillings' worth." So the man said, "Oh, you must be a fool!"
"Well," said Richard, "if it isn't that I am so sorry for you, I
should say 'serve you right,' because I really do happen to know."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_dangerously_Ill"></a>Richard dangerously Ill.</i></div>

<p>About the 17th of April, 1868, Richard, who had been looking
queer and seedy for six weeks, but persisting all the time that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
perfectly well, felt feverish and agueish, and went to bed. I gave him
calomel and castor oil, and then every sort of thing that I could
think of. He got worse and worse, and I was in despair, for there
were no doctors; but at last, after some days, a doctor did arrive
from Rio, and I sent for him at once, and he passed the night
in the house. Of course it was purely Brazilian treatment for a
Brazilian disease, and nothing we knew touched it. He had six
cuppings, with thirty-six glasses and twelve leeches, tartar emetic,
and all sorts of other things, and there was something to be given
or rubbed every half-hour, of which a very large ingredient was
orange tea. The doctor came twice a day, and the number of
remedies was wonderful, every half-hour, and I never left him day
or night. They blistered him terribly.</p>

<p>When Richard thought he was dying, he sent me for Fray João,
with whom he had been learning astronomy; but Fray João was
gone on an expedition up country for two months, and he would
not have anybody else for the Sacraments; but he accepted the
Scapular, which all Catholics will understand, and to others it is
not needful to explain, and he wore it to the day of his death.
One night he gave me a terrible fright; he asked me to give him
twenty drops of chlorodyne. I objected, but he was so imperative
about it that I thought he had been ordered it; fortunately, I only
gave him fifteen. He found it too strong, and, also fortunately,
he spat it out, and asked me to mix him another of ten, which he
drank. He soon frightened me by feeling sick and faint, and I
gave him lukewarm water to make him bring it up, and sent for the
doctor, who was very frightened about him. He was insensible
an hour. He gave ether pills, applied mustard to the calves of the
legs and inside the thighs, and then Richard had a calm and good
sleep all night, and from that got a great deal better. He was
able to go into his study after a month, and took his first drive five
weeks after he was taken ill, and at the end of seven weeks I was
able to take him down to the Barra, where Mr. Ford had kindly
lent us his bungalow, where Richard could sit on the sands and let
the sea roll over him, and here he got much better. I may now tell
a horrid little story, as it illustrates Richard's power of mesmerizing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Mesmerizing"></a>Mesmerizing.</i></div>

<p>Richard was a great mesmerizer, a thing which everybody who
knew him will understand.<a name="FNanchor_4_152" id="FNanchor_4_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_152" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He always preferred women, and
especially of the blue-eyed, yellow-haired type. I need not say
that he began with me as soon as we married; but I did not like it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
and used to resist it, but after a while I consented. At first it was
a little difficult, but when once he had complete control, no passes
or contact were necessary; he used simply to say, "Sleep," and I did.
He could also do this at a distance, but with more difficulty if water
were between us, and if he tried to mesmerize anybody else and I
was anywhere in the neighbourhood, I absorbed it, and they took
nothing. I used to grow at last to be afraid to be in the same room
with a mesmerizer, as I used to experience the greatest discomfort,
and I knew if there was one in the room, the same as some people
know if there is a cat in the room; but I could resist <i>them</i>, though
I could not resist Richard. He used to mesmerize me freely, but he
never allowed any one else, nor did I, to mesmerize me. Once
mesmerized, he had only to say, "Talk," and I used to tell everything
I knew, only I used to implore of him to forbid me to tell him other
people's secrets, and as a matter of honour he did, but all my own
used to come out freely; only he never took a mean advantage of
what he learnt in that way, and he used laughingly to tell everybody,
"It is the only way to get a woman to tell you the truth." I
have often told him things that I would much rather keep to
myself.</p>

<p>In the particular instance that I am about to recount, he had
mesmerized me to consult about an expedition that he was going
to take, as he had previous to his illness meant to start, and I had
said to him, "Don't start, because you are going to have a very bad
illness, and you will want me and your home comforts;" so he now
re-mesmerized me to know what he should do, and I said to him,
"Don't take the man that you are going to take with you, because
he is a scoundrel; don't buy the things that you are going to buy
for the expedition, because you will never use them. You will go
a long journey south for your health." I then said to him, "Look!
what a curious procession is passing our door, a long procession of
people in white, and headed by Maria and Julia"<a name="FNanchor_5_153" id="FNanchor_5_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_153" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;who were our
old cook and her daughter, aged about seventeen&mdash;"they are all in
white, with flowers on their heads. What can it mean?" I raved
all night about this procession, till Richard got up and shut the
shutters, and closed the door, which opened out on to the sands,
the night being very hot. The next day this procession made an
impression on him, and for curiosity's sake he sent up a mounted
messenger to São Paulo to know if anything had occurred, or if
there was any news. We had brought no servants with us, had left
my maid and everybody behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, on a former occasion, about three months back, he had
mesmerized me, and I had had this very cook called to me, and
I had said to her, "Maria, go to confession and communion, then
send to a lawyer and make your will. You have got a little cottage,
and you have saved £150; you have a few boxes of clothes and things.
Leave everything to Little Peter"&mdash;her son aged six&mdash;"and don't
trouble about Julia." When I came to, she told me the extraordinary
things I had been saying to her, and how frightened she was; but
she said, "I will do all that you have told me, only I can't leave
Julia without anything;" and I said to her, "I am not conscious of
having said anything; but in that case, you had better say that
whatever you leave to Julia goes to Peter at her death." Well, this
was the news that we got by the mounted messenger: The old cook
had died that day in an apoplectic fit, and before the maid had time
to call or send for the daughter, she walked in, looking very ill, and
sat upon the sofa, rocking and moaning, and she said, "I have come
from my mistress to die <i>here</i>. I feel so very ill, I will not leave you."
From all she told the maid, and the strange way she was going on,
the maid inferred that the girl was in a particular kind of trouble,
and it would be impossible to keep her there, and she begged of her
to let her fetch a carriage and conduct her back to her mistress,
where at least if she was ill she could be taken care of, and seeing
her in such a state, she was afraid to inform her that her mother
was lying dead. One of the slaves fetched a carriage, and they put
her into it, and were conducting her home, but she was so bad on
the road they had to lift her out, and take her into a little <i>venda</i>
(a place where they sell wine), and run to fetch a priest, who was
just in time to give her the last Sacraments, when she expired. The
blood oozed from her eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and from all the pores
of her skin. She died very shortly and was buried, and the smell
was so bad in the <i>venda</i> that the walls had to be scraped and rewhitewashed,
although she was only there a few hours. It was
afterwards proved that she and the black cook at her mistress's were
both in love with the same man, and as she had announced her
intention of visiting my house, the cook had given her a cup of
coffee before she set out, and had said, "Go! you will never come
back." The body was exhumed. It was supposed she had received
in the coffee a Brazilian poison, mixed with powdered glass, made
of some herbs of which the negroes have the secret. Little
Peter would have now become practically, though not theoretically,
a Brazilian slave, and his little property would have been absorbed;
but by the will made at the Consulate, he was under the protection
of the Consul. His education was undertaken, and he was sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
inheritor of the cottage, £150, and the boxes of clothes and other
property.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Regatta"></a>Regatta.</i></div>

<p>At Santos we had a regatta, a separate boat for each nation, about
nine or ten in all. The English blustered awfully, and the Americans
also&mdash;talked a great deal about "Bull's Run," and so forth. All
the other people sat very quiet, expecting to be beaten; the consequence
was the Portuguese won, and the English came in last, and
we sent up and hauled our flag down. The sea was very rough,
and surrounded our bungalow; we walked through bare-legged, and
went into Santos, and then went back again, and eventually to São
Paulo, partly on an engine, and partly walking&mdash;butterfly-catching.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_leave_Brazil_Richard_goes_South"></a>We leave Brazil&mdash;Richard goes South.</i></div>

<p>When we got back to São Paulo, Richard told me that he could
not stand it any longer; it had given him that illness, it was far away
from the world, it was no advancement, it led to nothing. He was
quite right. I felt very sorry, because up to the present it was the
only home I had ever really had quietly with him, and we had had it
for three years; but I soon sold up everything, and we came down to
Santos, and embarked on the 24th of July, 1868. Here he applied
for leave, as the doctors advised him not to go to England at once,
but to go down south to Buenos Ayres for a trip, and he asked me
to go to England and see if I could not induce them to give him
another post. I saw Richard off down south, and taking an affectionate
leave of all kind friends, embarked for England.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Our separate Journeys.</span></h4>


<p>Richard had a splendid journey to the Argentine Republic and the
rivers Plata-Paraná and Paraguay, for the purpose of reporting the
state of the Paraguayan War to the Foreign Office. He crossed
the Pampos and the Andes to Chili and Peru amongst the bad
Indians. He went to the Pacific Coast to inspect the scene of the
earthquake at Arica, returning by the Straits of Magellan, Buenos
Ayres, and Rio to London.</p>

<p>During his delightful trip, which completely recovered his health,
he fell in with the Tichborne Claimant, and travelled with him for a
week, and never having seen the real man, and as he appeared very
gentlemanly, and when he gambled, lost his money and won it
without any emotion, he concluded that he was the real thing until
he came home. He acquired all the history of the ins and outs of
the war, and later produced his book on Paraguay&mdash;"Letters from
the Battle-Fields of Paraguay," which did not see the light till 1870.</p>

<p>I had, as usual, all my work cut out for me. First I was to try
and work the Iporanga mines in London, whole mountains of lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
and quicksilver, also gold and copper (twenty-eight square miles). I
was to bring out his "Highlands of Brazil," the "Journey of Lacerda,"
and a second edition of "Mecca," "Uruguay;" "Iracema," and
"Manoel de Moraes."</p>

<p>I also had a small adventure on the way home at Bahía. I went
ashore with a friend from the ship to dine with "Charley Williams,"
my husband's friend. He was very fond of keeping a menagerie;
besides having his garden stocked with wild beasts, his hall contained
cages of snakes, amongst them two rattlesnakes. After we had
dined in his <i>chacara</i>, he insisted on showing me his snakes, and he
quietly took one up (out of its cage) near its head. He was used to doing
this, but whether he was agitated or what I cannot say, but the snake
slipped through his hand, and bit him on the wrist. The friend had
bolted upstairs the moment the cage was opened; Mr. Williams just
had time to dash it back into the cage and lock it, and staggered
against the wall.</p>

<p>Richard had always taught me how to be ready on such emergencies
travelling up the country, but the only thing in the hall was
a box of wooden lucifer-matches, so I struck them one after another,
and kept cramming them into the mark on his wrist made by the
snake till I had made a regular little hole. I tied my handkerchief
tightly above it, called out loudly for the servants, told them
what had happened, and to go and get a bottle of whisky. By
degrees I got the whole bottle down his throat, and then my friend
and I and the negroes kept walking him up and down for about
three hours. We then allowed him to go to bed, and next morning
he was no worse for what had happened. I think the bite must have
been very feeble not to have done more harm&mdash;probably the snake
had only time to graze the skin; anyway, the dear old man was so
pleased, he brought me home a riding-whip of solid silver up to the
lash, which I keep now as a memento.</p>

<p>We had a bad sea and, strong trade winds most of the way; the ship,
was horribly lively off Finisterre, and the hatches down. We found,
it bitterly cold in August, and on the 1st of September my family met
me at Southampton. They were then all puffing and panting and
fanning themselves on account of the "tropical weather," as they
called it, and I found it so bitterly cold, I had to have several
blankets and a big fire, showing the difference of the climates.
There was great amusement when my sisters came on board. I took
them to my cabin, which was considered the best in the ship. The
Captain was showing it off, when one of them, who had never been,
at sea in her life, turned round to me and said, "Now, Isabel, do
you <i>really</i> mean to say that you have lived in that housemaid's closet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
for a month, and slept on that shelf?" The Captain laughed.
"Really, ladies," he said, "this is considered a very swell ship, and
everybody fights for that cabin."</p>

<p>I did my work well, carrying out everything according to Richard's
directions, and Lord Derby, then Lord Stanley, whose sound sense
and great judgment knew exactly the man to suit the post, and the
post to suit the man, gave him the long-coveted Consulship of
Damascus, and was brave enough not to heed the jealousy and spite
which did its best to prevent his being allowed to take the post. The
Missionaries raised up their heads on the one side, and the people
who wanted it for their friends, did all they could to persuade Lord
Stanley that it would displease the Moslems, because he had been
to Mecca. Richard was delighted when he got the intelligence of
his transfer from Brazil to Damascus. He heard it casually in a
<i>café</i> at Lima, where he was congratulated, having missed most of his
letters. He hastened back at once, and he wrote and guaranteed
to Lord Stanley that all would be well with the Moslems, as it had
ever been from the starting of his career in 1842 up to the present
time, 1868&mdash;a period of twenty-six years; consequently the appointment
was signed, with a thousand a year. Richard's prospects were
on the rise, and it was hinted that if he succeeded <i>there</i> he might
eventually get Marocco, Teheran, and finish up at Constantinople.
In fact, we were on the zenith of our career.</p>

<p>I had one very pleasant dinner at Mr. Froude's to meet Giffard
Palgrave, Mr. Ruskin, and Carlyle. I brought out Richard's "Highlands
of Brazil" for Christmas. I was not successful with the mines,
and I found no market for the Brazilian translations, though I
published two of them.</p>

<p class="capt">CARBINE PISTOL.</p>
</div>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Captain Burton's Carbine-pistol and Projectile (patented).</span></h4>


<p>"The principle of the weapon is to avoid the use of the shoulder
on horseback. The weapon can be used either as a carbine with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
both hands, the left arm extended as in archery: in this case the
cartridge contains eighty-four grains of gunpowder. Used with one
hand, the charge must be reduced to forty-five grains. The projectile
serves to blow up ammunition, to fire inflammable articles, and so
forth. When explosive projectiles are used with this weapon, a
special <i>safety</i> bullet has been provided by Captain Burton (see
section). It will neither explode if let fall on its point, nor on
being fired through brushwood.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">A Cavalry Pistol.</span></h4>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;Will you kindly allow me to describe in your well-read
columns the pistol which is proposed for countries where the
traveller's life must often depend upon his weapons?</p>

<p>"I have lately inquired in vain, whilst inspecting stock at half
the armouries of the West End, for a single-barrel breech-loading
pistol. Of double-barrels there were plenty, but none pleased me.
The system of opening the breech is complicated by the presence
of two cocks, and it is not what a man requires when looking around
at the enemy; he must use the hands without the guidance of the
eyes. Moreover, the prices vary from £9 5<i>s.</i> to £16. This unconscionable
sum is supposed not to include any 'fixings,' even the
normal hundred cartridges. I come to the conclusion that the trade
prefers the double-barrel simply because the public has to pay double
for it. The French are, as usual of late years, well to the fore of
us. M. Lefancheux, of Rue Vivienne, has a good single-barrel,
throwing a round ball of one ounce (one-sixteenth of a pound); but
the breech opening is in a manner which I do not admire, and the
price is three hundred francs.</p>

<p>"In conversation with a London gunsmith, I suggested as a holster-pistol
a central-fire Albini rifle&mdash;the weapon adopted in Belgium&mdash;with
barrel cut short to about one foot, and the stock changed to
a saw-handle; this should, for the purpose of leverage, be made
long and heavy. The gunsmith adopted the idea at once, wrote
to the Albini Company, and the result was a weapon which, with
certain unimportant improvements, will, I believe, presently supplant
the popular but uncertain and dangerous revolver, whilst by a tolerably
strong wrist it can be used as a pistol. It may be fired at rest
on the left arm, or held like a carbine in both hands. With bandolier
or cartridge-case bound to his breast, the soldier will readily do with
this weapon the work of a succession of revolvers, each holding only
five to six shots. The 'Albini pistol' cannot miss fire. How many
good lives have been lost by depending upon this revolver! And
the pistol deals a one-ounce ball; not the pellets of which many a
backwoodsman has taken a cylinderful, and yet has continued
'shyuting' till he killed his man. Finally, it is economical. My
weapon, with belt, pouch, and a hundred charges, costs £6 10<i>s.</i>;
but a large demand will readily bring down the price to £5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am convinced that the Albini, or some similar system, will be
the pistol of the future, and I take the liberty of introducing it to
you immediately after its birth.<a name="FNanchor_6_154" id="FNanchor_6_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_154" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F. Burton, F.R.G.S.</span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;In a forthcoming volume upon the Paraguayan War, I
hope to show that the pistol will be, <i>par excellence</i>, the future arm of
cavalry."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">From the Press.</span></h4>


<p>"A pistol that can kill at five hundred yards has not, we believe,
been yet introduced to the public. This boon has been left for
Captain Burton to invent, and he has invented, and, what is more,
patented it. The butt is that of an ordinary pistol; the barrel is
that of a good rifle, cut short, but leaving sufficient 'turn' to send
the bullet on its deadly errand with the proper spin. The chief
object is to send a rifle-bullet at an enemy or at game without having
to use the shoulder, especially when on horseback. And to accomplish
this the barrel is fitted with a steel handle to be grasped by the
left hand, while the arm is extended as in archery. The left arm is,
in fact, formed into a beam of your own flesh and blood, and the
carbine-pistol moves freely as on a pivot placed at the end of it, while
the butt is directed by the right hand, which takes aim and fires.
The recoil is scarcely felt by the rigid left arm; it does not affect the
firer so much as the kick to the shoulder would do. The advantage
of this arrangement in the case of ladies is obvious. The pistol can
also be used with one hand like an ordinary pistol. But in that case
it is recommended that the charge be reduced from eighty-four grains
of gunpowder to forty-five. The inventor has also provided a patent
safety bullet which will explode as a shell when it crashes against the
bones of large game, but will pass through brushwood or through
the skin of a wild animal like an ordinary ball. It will not explode
if let fall upon its apex, but if fired into a box of ammunition it will
blow up everything without fail. It is an invaluable projectile, combining
the best qualities of the bullet and shell, just the weapon of
precision which sends it to its destination, combines the best features
of the carbine and the pistol. The carbine-pistol is so light and
handy that it will become an indispensable <i>vade mecum</i> with people
making excursions through jungles in India. No tiger could afford
to laugh at it, though in appearance it is as unpretending as a horse-pistol."</p></blockquote>

<p>This year, before Richard arrived, I had the pleasure of making
the acquaintance of Sir Samuel and Lady Baker; I was very much
fascinated by the latter, and thought her very pretty. Next day I
lunched with them. I also saw a good deal of the Petherwicks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
and amongst others on his return we dined more than once with my
husband's old Egyptian friend, John Larking, at his place, "The
Firs," Lea, Kent.</p>

<p>At last the time came round when I got a telegram to say that
the <i>Douro</i>, Royal Mail, would be at Southampton, with Richard on
board; so I went down to Southampton, and at four o'clock in the
morning, when Richard looked over the side, I was the first person
he saw, and when the plank was thrown across, I was the first to go
on board. As far as clothes went, he was pretty nearly in the same
condition that I was in, when I arrived from the mines; but for all
that, as soon as he had had bath and breakfast, we drove to Netley
Abbey, and went to the flower show; then came up to town, and
drove to a haberdasher, tailor, and hatter, that he might be fit to
dine with my people, who had a party and an enthusiastic reception
for him.</p>

<p>He went straight to the Foreign Office next day to report himself,
and call on Lord Stanley and Lord Clarendon, who had succeeded
to the Foreign Office, and went a round of publishers, mappers, and
commissions. That night we had to go to the Admiralty party,
and from thence to the Foreign Office party, and the next night, at
the Literary Fund, Richard made a speech. He dined with Sir
Roderick Murchison, and he went to the Royal Geographical
Society Meeting, found it slow, and <i>was not satisfied with his reception</i>;
he also went to the Levée.</p>

<p>We then went down to Shrewsbury, to stay with Mr. Henry
Wace, a bachelor lawyer and a faithful friend, and drove to Uriconium,
the Pompeii of Shrewsbury, and then to Haughmond ruins,
formerly a Cistercian monastery. Amongst other pleasant things was
a lunch-party at Bernal Osborne's, and delightful dinners at Shirley
Brookes'.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Pleasant_Days_in_Vichy_and_Auvergne"></a>Pleasant Days in Vichy and Auvergne.</i></div>

<p>At last we crossed to France, visited our old haunts where we met
as boy and girl. Boulogne, however, was very much changed since
our days. She was then "a girl of the period;" she was now "<i>vieille</i>
and <i>dévote</i>." From here he sent me back, as usual, to "pay, pack,
and follow." He was going to Vichy, to take a month's course of
the waters, after which he would drop down to Brindisi and go to
Damascus.</p>

<p>Soon after Richard had started to Vichy, I began to get unhappy,
and wanted to join him, and I did not see why I could not
have the month there with him and make up double-quick time
after; so I just started off with Mr. J. J. Aubertin (of Brazil memory,
whose many works have made him well known, and whose charming
"Wanderings and Wonderings" is attracting the literary world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
now), who was also going there to join him. It was the last <i>Fête
Napoleon</i>. I never saw Paris so splendid; it was lighter than day&mdash;from
the Tuileries to the Barrière de L'Étoile it was one mass
of light. The Tuileries Gardens were hung with lamps representing
huge bunches of grapes, fastened together with festoons and knots
the whole length of the Champs Élysées. It was the last blaze
of glory; before that day year they were fighting the Germans.
As soon as I arrived at Vichy, Richard, with Swinburne, came to
the station to meet me, and we were joined by Sir Frederick Leighton,
and later on, Mrs. Sartoris.</p>

<p>Vichy is a dull small place, full of sickly people with liver complaints.
Like all other places, the baths and the water-drinking
fountains are the principal rendezvous. There is the usual band,
promenade under the trees, casino, garden, and theatre.</p>

<p>They were very happy days. We made excursions in the day,
and in the evenings the conversation, I need not say, was brilliant;
everybody contributed something that made him or her valuable.
Swinburne recited poetry, Mrs. Sartoris sang to us. All will remember
her exquisite contralto voice, and she sang <i>en intime</i> without
accompaniment.</p>

<p>We went to the Château Bourbonnais at Bussy, and then to
Ardoisière cascade and cave, and lovely walks to Malavaux, where
there is a châlet at the foot of the mountain and a steep ascent.
Here is the ruin of a convent of Templars, who are said to have
committed atrocities, who blew up a château containing their only
neighbours with gunpowder. There were no roads this way, and
they were Lords of the soil. There is a cemetery in the distance,
and close to us the Devil's Well, said to have no bottom, and also
the Blessed Virgin's Well. Whilst we were at the top, the harvest
moon arose; there was a glorious scene of beautiful lights and
shadows. Swinburne has lately celebrated this journey in a glorious
elegy, of which I quote three verses (the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, July,
1892)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The huddled churches clinging on the cliffs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As birds alighting might for storm's sake cling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Moored to the rocks as tempest-harried skiffs</span><br />

<p>

<p>From St. Armand there is a splendid view of Vichy, and also for
forty-four leagues, if it is clear enough to see around; and the drives
are lovely through the mountains and ravines. There was another
splendid view from the Montagne Vert. We went to St. Germain
des Fosses, and drove all over Clermont, where we visited the
Cathedral, all the Churches, Museums, and springs, and bought some
of the wonderful petrifactions.<a name="FNanchor_7_155" id="FNanchor_7_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_155" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> We then made our way to Langéac,
from whence we drove thirty-six miles through a most interesting
country to Puy. The descent to Puy is very beautiful. It is a
curious and striking-looking town; mountains of rock, like huge
combs, rise out of its heart. On the top of one of these is a huge
statue of the Blessed Virgin, sixteen metres high, cast in iron from
the metal cannons of Sebastopol, and we got up into its head to
look out of the eyes. When we were in the head we were nearly
five hundred feet high from the plain. The Child's head holds three
people. The Cathedral has a miraculous black Virgin, and St.
Michael has his church too. All these great heights mean climbing
five hundred feet, and then ascending two or three hundred steps.
On another cone stands an old church. There are basaltic masses
just like organ-pipes. We drove to the old Castle and Fortress of
Polignac, and to the basaltic rocks, and then we went to see the
Museum of Puy. We made our way by the train to Lyons. The
country was beautiful, with mountains, gorges, rivers, and old ruined
castles, which spoke of feudal times; but two hours before reaching
Lyons it is as bad as the black country in Lancashire. Here Swinburne
left us for Paris. Richard and I went to Fourvières to make
a pilgrimage.<a name="FNanchor_8_156" id="FNanchor_8_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_156" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We went to the Cathedral, and the great shrine of
Notre Dame de Fourvières. From here Lyons spreads out under
your feet like a map; on a clear day you may see Mont Blanc.
We visited the source of the Rhone and Saone, and then went on
to Culoz; thence to Aix les Bains, where we went to look at the
Roman ruins. We changed trains at S. Michel for "Fell's Company"
across the Mont Cenis (the railway not being made in those
days as it is now). Mr. Bayless, the superintendent, and his secretary
met us, and took us on the engine, and showed us everything.
The scenery was splendid all day; the rise began from S. Michel
to Lanslebourg, which is four thousand four hundred feet high. The
ascent was most amusing; we whisked about in the most frolicsome
way, close to frightful gorges and over ravines. From inside, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
could sometimes hear little hysterical squeaks, or people taken worse,
as the curves were very sharp and the pace good. Lanslebourg is
a group of old broken-down châlets, and two broken-down chapels,
grouped in a corner. It has a new chapel now. A mountain-torrent
sweeps through the village, and the new railway runs by it. Magnificent
piles of mountains rose on all sides; the lower range are
pine-covered, the higher by snow and glaciers&mdash;the snow and fresh
mountain air are most exhilarating. I can remember passing this
place ten years before, in March, with a carriage and eleven mules,
and, owing to the snow, we were five days and nights travelling from
Venice to Geneva. It was then a savage country; now every available
spot is cultivated in little patches. We had a charming evening at
the inn, and dined on fresh mountain trout. The descent next day
was marvellous. How little Napoleon I. thought, when he was
making a road, that he was only the pioneer for an English railway,
thereby making their labour and expense only half of what it would
have been! We went from here to Susa and Turin, and from Turin
we drove up the Collina, and got a splendid view of the City and
of Mount Rosa before going to bed. Here I saw Richard off to
Damascus; he was to catch the P. and O. at Brindisi. My train
Londonwards left a few hours after, and I did not stop till I reached
Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Geographical_Disagreeables"></a>Geographical Disagreeables.</i></div>

<p>During this short time, Richard's absence permitted a few disagreeables
in the geographical line, and as he always relied upon me
to answer for him, when he was away, I did so. He said he felt
like having a second self on a spot where he could not be, when our
affairs compelled us to do double work. Therefore, in answer to a
question of Sir Roderick Murchison's, "Where is Livingstone?"
I wrote&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Livingstone</span>.</h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;Will you spare me a little space in your columns to do a
service to Dr. Livingstone, by calling attention to Lucenda or Lunda
City, the capital of the African chief, known as the Muata (king)
Cazembe?</p>

<p>"He is not the least important of the eight negro monarchs&mdash;namely,
the Muata Ya Noo, vulgarly 'Matiamoo,' in the south; in
the eastern tropic, the despots of Karagwán, of Uganda, and of
Unyoro; and, in the western regions, the sanguinary tyrants of
Benin, of Dahomè, and of Asiante or Ashantee. And the name
of this somewhat obscure potentate has, during the last few weeks,
come prominently before the Royal Geographical Society of
London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not long ago Sir Roderick Murchison suggested in the <i>Times</i>
that Dr. Livingstone, having found a discrepancy between the levels
of the 'Albert Nyanza' and the Tanganyika lakes, probably turned
westward, and attempted to trace the drainage of the latter into
the Atlantic Ocean. My husband, Captain Burton, objected to this
view of his revered Chief, after whose image&mdash;to use the words of
the late Lord Strangford&mdash;our modern geographers are, so to speak,
created. The hydrography of the West African coast is now well
known, and it shows no embouchure capable of carrying off so vast
an expanse of water as the Tanganyika. The Congo mouth may
suggest itself to some, more especially as the north-eastern branch
has long been reported to issue from a lake. But the north-eastern
is the smaller arm of the two. Moreover, Captain Burton, during
his visit to the Yellalah or Rapids, in 1863, ascertained, by questioning
the many slaves driven down from the far interior to the Angolan
coast, that the Congo lake is distinct from the Tanganyika, and is
probably that which figures in old maps as Lake Aquilonda or
Achelunda. It will not be forgotten that our good friend Paul du
Chaillu made sundry stout-hearted attempts to reach that mysterious
basin, concerning which he is also of opinion that it is wholly
independent of the Nile Valley.</p>

<p>"The latest intelligence touching Dr. Livingstone suggests the
possibility of his having been detained in the capital of the Cazembe,
and at once explains the non-appearance of the traveller, and the
want of communications, so heartrending to his host of friends.
Why are we whispering this to one another as a secret? The report,
if we believe in its truth, should be published throughout the length
and breadth of England, whose great heart will readily supply men
and means to rescue one of her favourite sons from a precarious and
perhaps perilous position.</p>

<p>"Unhappily for himself, Dr. Livingstone, unlike Captain Burton,
has never made a friend of the Moslem. He has openly preferred
to him the untutored African&mdash;in other words, the vile and murderous
Fetisheer&mdash;and his published opinions must be known even at
Zanzibar to the religion of the State. The Maskat Arabs are, as
my husband reported long ago, all-powerful at the city of Cazembe;
and if Dr. Livingstone be detained there, it is doubtless at their
instigation.</p>

<p>"I should not have ventured to trouble you with this letter, but
Captain Burton is <i>en route</i> for Damascus, and I have written to him
to supply the public with a complete account of the scene of Dr.
Livingstone's supposed captivity, which may tend to suggest the
properest measures for securing the safety of a Christian hero who
has offered up the flower of his days to the grand task of regenerating
the Dark Continent.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>

<p>"Yours obediently,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span></p>

<p>"October 23, 1869."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Work"></a>Work.</i></div>

<p>I worked in earnest during my few weeks in England, to be able
to join him the quicker. First, I had to go down to Stratford, to
the Essex flats, to see the tube-wells worked, as Richard was anxious
to be able to produce water, if possible, wherever we stopped in the
desert. I had many publishers and mappers to see. Not knowing
exactly what Damascus was like, I invested in a pony-carriage, and
Uncle Gerard gave me a very handsome old family chariot, which was
out of fashion in England, and must originally have cost at least
three hundred guineas. Lord Houghton made a great many jokes
about our driving in our chariot drawn by camels. I very prudently
left it in England until I saw what sort of place it was, but took
out the pony-carriage. There was only one road in the country, of
seventy-two miles, so I sold it, and was actually lucky enough to find
a willing customer, who kept it as a curio. I took lessons about
taking off wheels and patent axles, and oiling them and putting
them together again, and taking my own guns and pistols also to
pieces, cleaning and putting them together again. The time passed
in buying things to stock the house with. Richard did not receive any
of my letters, just as at Pernambuco, so I had to telegraph to him.</p>

<p>During this time Mr. William Crookes and I visited the
Mesmeric Hospital, where, I regret to say, I did a good deal of
unintentional mischief, by absorbing the mesmerism from the patients;
and I attended the meetings of the Royal Geographical Society,
and felt very angry with Sir Roderick Murchison, which I expressed
in two letters attached to the Nile affair, as follows:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Sources of the Nile.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Times</i>.</h5>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Nile"></a>The Nile.</i></div>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;As you daily devote a certain portion of the <i>Times</i> to redressing
wrongs, I may hope that you will not make an exception to
the disadvantage of Captain Burton.</p>

<p>"Five African explorers have pined for the honour of discovering
the sources of the Nile, and each one in his turn has believed himself
to be that fortunate person, until now that Livingstone (the one
who cared the least for that honour) has discovered waters more
southerly still. We have all been looking forward with eagerness
for this news. Judge, then, of my mortification at the meeting of
the Royal Geographical Society on Monday night, to hear all the
papers read and discussed almost without reference to Captain
Burton, who is <i>en route</i> to Damascus. His lake (Tanganyika), which
lies the nearest to Livingstone's new discovery, was almost skipped
over, and my revered friend, Sir Roderick Murchison, spoke of
'Central, or Equatorial Africa, in which lie those great water basins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
which, thanks to the labours of Speke, Grant, and Baker, are known
to feed the Nile.' After the meeting I went up to Sir Roderick
Murchison and asked him <i>why</i> Captain Burton had been left out,
and he replied in the kindest manner, 'that if it had been so, it was
a mere oversight, which he was sorry should have occurred,' and I
heard him give the order that it should be rectified in the report
before sent to press. I see by your columns of Wednesday, the
10th, <i>that it was not done</i>, and I therefore ask you in kindness and
courtesy to insert these few lines, that Captain Burton may not be
counted for nothing by that large meeting on Monday night in the
matter nearest his heart.</p>

<p>"In 1854 and 1855 Captain Burton was employed in heading the
Somali Expedition (which ended so fatally), taking with him Captain
Speke and two others. From 1856 to 1859 he was occupied in exploring
Central Equatorial Africa, taking again Captain Speke as
second in command. He was the first to conceive the idea twenty
years ago, the first to enter and to penetrate that country, which he
did under every obstacle and difficulty, bringing back sufficient
information to smooth the path to all who chose to follow him.
Lake Tanganyika was his first discovery, Nyanza was Speke's.</p>

<p>"In 1860 Captain Speke started on his own account, taking
Captain Grant as second in command, whereby we gained some
three hundred and fifty geographical miles, only hitherto known by
vague report. Captain Burton spent those three years on the West
Coast, at Dahomè and Du Chaillu's country, making ten years, off
and on, in Africa.</p>

<p>"Then followed Sir Samuel Baker's Lake, and now Livingstone's.</p>

<p>"It is therefore <i>impossible</i> to ignore Captain Burton's services in
the Nile question. Dr. Livingstone has undoubtedly discovered
<i>the</i> sources,<a name="FNanchor_9_157" id="FNanchor_9_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_157" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and must rank the first, but no man can claim the second
honour, or the water nearest Livingstone's discovery, but Captain
Burton, and no one can deny the fact that he, so to speak, opened
the oyster for the others to get at the pearl.</p>

<p>"All our friends are asking me why he was left out the other
night, and the kind-hearted ones offer me the consoling proverb that
'good wine needs no bush,' which, after all, is nonsense to any but
connoisseurs.</p>

<p>"I am, Sir, yours obediently,</p>

<p>"November 12th, 1869."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Still_the_Nile"></a>Still the Nile.</i></div>

<p>I then sent to the <i>Athenæum</i> the little tracing of 1856, which I
have inserted on <a href="#Page_255">page 255</a>, with the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Sources of the Nile</span>.</h4>


<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Athenæum</i>.</h5>

<p>"November 20th, 1869.</p>

<p>"I enclose you a copy of a small map which I have had for many
years in my possession, showing Captain Burton's theory respecting
the sources of the Nile as far back as 1856. In that year he left
England to command the Expedition for their discovery, which had
been the object of his thoughts and studies for many previous years&mdash;always
a disciple of Ptolemy. Captain Speke joined him, and after
three years of unheard-of difficulties and dangers, they returned,
having discovered Tanganyika. Whilst they were absent, Captain
Burton, being very ill for a short time, and experiencing a yearning
to be alone, sent Captain Speke on a twenty days' march to try and
find a lake, which his calculations, theories, and inquiries from the
Arabs, assured him ought to be there. Speke sighted a water then,
and subsequently found on his next expedition, but much farther
north, a lake which he called Victoria Nyanza.</p>

<p>"I quote a note from Captain Burton's 'Nile Basin,' p. 37, which is
the pivot of the whole affair: 'I distinctly deny that any "misleading,
by my instructions from the Royal Geographical Society as to the
position of the White Nile," left me unconscious of the vast importance
of ascertaining the Rusizi river's direction. The fact is,
Captain Speke was deaf and almost blind. I was paralytic, and we
were both helpless [he might have added penniless]. We did our
best to reach it, and failed.'</p>

<p>"Captain Burton always said from the first that the Nile must
have many sources, and that there were probably waters south of the
Tanganyika. In his 'Lake Regions' he speaks of a large river,
Marungu, draining the southern countries towards the Tanganyika,
and entering the lake at its southernmost point, which has now been
proved by Dr. Livingstone.<a name="FNanchor_10_158" id="FNanchor_10_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_158" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He was misled by Captain Speke's
erroneous elevation of the lake, and by the more than probably wrong
information received from the African chiefs, as interpreted by his
negro servant Bombay. In short, Captain Speke determined to have
his own lake at all hazards, and for a time he became master of
the field.</p>

<p>"I am anxious, before I sail to join Captain Burton at Damascus&mdash;and
I have not many days left&mdash;to claim Captain Burton's proper
position amongst the five explorers of the lakes, having already had
a reminder that '<i>les absents ont toujours tort</i>.' That position means,
<i>second</i> to Livingstone as explorer, to whom he has shown the way
to the Nile, and <i>first</i> as lake discoverer.</p>

<p>"The outlines of the map I refer to were drawn for me in 1856,
and where lakes are now correctly marked on maps stood pencil
notes, which said, 'Should be water here,' 'Supposed site of a lake.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
The lakes and names were successively filled up for me in 1859 and
1864. Perhaps you may think it interesting enough to give it a
place in your paper, and will kindly allow this letter to accompany
it; or the letter by itself if there is no room for the map.</p>

<p>Then appeared in <i>Punch</i>&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">A Card from the Isle of Africa.</span></h4>


<p>"Father Nile presents his respectful compliments to Mr. Punch,
and (with grateful remembrance of the delightful way in which that

<p>"Over the signature 'Isabel Burton,' names belonging
to the accomplished wife of the Consul at Damascus, hath appeared
(<i>Times</i>) a wifely and spirited letter, pointing out that at the great
geographical meeting last week, recognition was not made of the
discovery, by Captain Burton, of Lake Tanganyika.</p>

<p>"Sir, I am glad of anything that causes Mrs. Burton to publish
anything. Unlike some of her sex (and of mine), that lady can think
as well as write.</p>

<p>"But I have two reasons for wishing that another system of nomenclature,
in regard to places, were adopted.</p>

<p>"(1) I am not good at spelling, even in English, and the barbarous
names given by savages worry me much, and send me across the
room to atlases, and the like, when it is a bother to me to get
off my chair. Perhaps on cold days, like to-day, my style, in
the winter, is much more involved than in summer. This is because,
to avoid going into the cold, I go into periphrase, and circumvent
hard words.</p>

<p>"(2) Injustice, like that indicated by Mrs. Burton (in this case
accidental; Sir Roderick is <i>sans reproche</i>), would be impossible if new
discoveries were stamped properly.</p>

<p>"Henceforth call Lake Nyanza Lake Speke-Grant; the lake above
mentioned (which I pray you to excuse me from spelling a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>

<p>At last the day came round when everything was bought and paid
for, and packed and sent off, and I was at liberty to start; and the
same night that my arrangements were complete, I left my mother's
house for Dover. It was blowing a hurricane, waves mountain high,
and a black night, and my brother and sisters, who accompanied
me, decided that I must not go on board. I have told that story in
my "Inner Life of Syria." Next morning, however, we picked up
the poor passengers, who had crossed the night before, and had
come to grief. At Paris I found that two of my nine boxes were
missing; one contained all my ship comforts, and the other £300
in gold&mdash;my little all. I had already taken my passage at Marseilles,
and I had to choose between losing my money and losing my
passage. I went to the station-master, registered my tale, omitting
all about the money, told him where to forward the baggage,<a name="FNanchor_11_159" id="FNanchor_11_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_159" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
travelled on, and was just in time to catch the P. and O. <i>Tanjore</i>
before she steamed out, and I immediately, on arrival at Alexandria,
took my passage on board the first steamer for Beyrout, which was
a Russian, the <i>Ceres</i>, which passes or touches at Port Said and Jaffa,
and Kaifa, the ancient Helba of the tribe of Aser, St. Jeanne d'Acre,
and then I arrived at Beyrout.</p>

<h4>DAMASCUS&mdash;HIS THIRD CONSULATE.</h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_find_Richard_has_had_a_Cordial_Reception"></a>I find Richard has had a Cordial Reception.</i></div>

<p>There was no husband to meet me, and I felt very indignant,
just as had happened at Rio last year to him. (Here I met Madame
de Persigny.) I at once started for Damascus by road, in a private
carriage, and drove for seven hours, putting up at Shtorra, where
I was obliged to sleep. Next day I drove on and on, and reached
Damascus at sunset; went straight to the inn, which by courtesy was
called a hotel, known as Demetri's. It had taken me fifteen days
and nights without stopping from London to Damascus. After an
hour Richard came in, and I was glad that I had waited for nothing
but necessity, as I found him looking very old and ill. He had
arrived, and had had a most cordial reception, but he had been dispirited
by not getting a single one of my letters, which all arrived in
a heap afterwards. He had gone down over and over again to meet
me, and I had not appeared, and now the steamer that I had come
in, was the only one he did not go down to meet, so that when he
came in from his walk, it was a pleasant surprise to him to find me
ensconced comfortably in his room; and I found the enclosed
scribbled on the corner of his journal, anent my non-arrival&mdash;</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>A few persons who disliked the appointment, and certain missionaries
who feared that he was anti-missionary, and have since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
handsomely acknowledged their mistake, took measures to work
upon Lord Clarendon on the plea that he was too fond of Mohammedans,
that he had performed a pilgrimage to Mecca, and that
their fanaticism would lead to troubles and dangers. On becoming
aware that he had lived in the East, and with Moslems, for many
years after his pilgrimage, Lord Clarendon, with that good taste
and justice which always characterized him, refused to change his
appointment until that fanaticism was proved. He had the pleasure
of reporting to him a particularly friendly reception.
He wrote before he left London&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I now renew in writing the verbal statement, in which I assured
your lordship that neither the authorities nor the people of Damascus
will show for me any but a friendly feeling; that, in fact, they will
receive me as did the Egyptians and the people of Zanzibar for years
after my pilgrimage to Mecca. But, as designing persons may have
attempted to complicate the situation, I once more undertake to act
with unusual prudence, and under all circumstances to hold myself,
and myself only, answerable for the consequences."</p></blockquote>

<p>Though he had not received his barat (<i>exequatur</i>) and firman till
October 27th, he exchanged friendly unofficial visits with his Excellency,
the <i>Wali</i> (Governor-General) of Syria. Then he was
honoured with the visits of all the prelates of the Oriental Churches,
as well as by a great number of the most learned and influential
Moslems, and of the principal Christians. Amongst them were his
Highness the Amir Abd el Kadir, his Excellency the Bishop of the
Greek Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox and the Syrian Catholic
Bishops, the Archimandrite Jebara of the Russian Orthodox Church,
the Shaykh el Ulemá (Abdullah Effendi el Hálabi), the Shaykh el
Molawíyyeh of Koniah, Ali Pasha el Aazam, and Antun Effendi
Shami; Said Effendi Ustuwáneh, President of the Criminal Court of
Damascus and its dependencies; Mohammed Effendi el Minnini,
Vice-President of the Criminal Court of Appeal; the Mufti Mahmúd
Effendi Hamzeh; Shaykh Mohammed Effendi el Hálabi, member of
the Lower Court, and several others.</p>

<p>All these dignitaries evinced much pleasure and satisfaction at his
being appointed H.M.'s Consul in their City. Some of them, indeed,
earnestly requested him to interest the English public in forming a
company for making railways through Syria, that being the sole means
of bringing about the civilization of the country.</p>

<p>In conclusion, notwithstanding Abdullah Effendi, the Chief of the
Ulemá, being the most learned, influential, and Orthodox Moslem,
and though it is not consistent with his principles to call upon any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
Christian before being visited, he did so; and, after an interview of
fifty minutes, departed with a promise to renew the visit.</p>

<p>Owing to the great quantity of fountains and tanks about the house,
neuralgia had set in, and Richard had not been getting any sleep;
so the following day we cast about for a better sort of living-place,
and a quarter of an hour away, through the gardens of Damascus,
higher up than Damascus, and just under and on the north of Jebel
Kaysún, the Camomile Mountain, in what is <i>called</i> a wild and lawless
Kurdish village, we found a house that suited us,<a name="FNanchor_1_160" id="FNanchor_1_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_160" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and we took
it, and moved into it next day, starting with a small quantity of
furniture, but soon made it very comfortable. After all said and
done, although some of the houses in Damascus were very grand
and very romantic, they were all damp; cold in winter; suffocating,
from being closed in, in summer. If there is an epidemic, it is like
being hived. If there is an <i>émeute</i>, you are like a mouse in a trap.
If there is a fire at night, you are safely locked within the town
gates. Ours was a freer and wilder life; you could mount your
horse, and be out in the desert in ten minutes, or in Damascus
either.</p>

<p>Mr. and Lady Adelaide Law arrived in Damascus, and I took her
to Lady Ellenborough and to Abd el Kadir. It was her father,
Lord Londonderry, whose diplomacy with Louis Napoleon delivered
this great hero from imprisonment in the Château d'Amboise, and
he received her with effusion. Later on came Lord Stafford
(present Duke of Sutherland), Mr. Crawley, and Mr. Barty Mitford.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_go_to_Palmyra_or_Tadmor_in_the_Desert"></a>We go to Palmyra, or Tadmor in the Desert.</i></div>

<p>We were soon installed, and bought horses, and I began to study
Arabic. The first thing Richard determined to do was to go to
Tadmor. This journey was an awfully difficult thing in those days,
though I am not aware whether it is now. First of all, six thousand
francs used to be charged by the El Mezrab, who were the tribe who
escorted for that journey. It was the tribe of Lady Ellenborough
and her Bedawin husband, and she was more Bedawin than the
Bedawi. There was no water, that is, only two wells the whole way,
and only known to them. The difficulties and dangers were great;
they travelled by night and hid by day. You may say that camels
were about ten days on the road, and horses about eight days.
The late Lady Ellenborough was the third of a small knot of
ladies, of whom I had hoped to make the fifth&mdash;Lady Mary Wortley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
Montagu, Lady Hester Stanhope, Lady Ellenborough, and the
Princesse de la Tour d'Auvergne.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_go_without_an_Escort"></a>We go without an Escort.</i></div>

<p>Lady Ellenborough was married to a Bedawin, brother to the
Chief, and second in command of the tribe of El Mezrab, a
small branch of the great Anazeh tribe. She aided the tribe in
concealing the wells and levying blackmail on Europeans who
wished to visit Palmyra, which brought in considerable sums to
the tribe, whose demand was six thousand francs a head (£240).
Richard was determined to go, and we had not the money to throw
away; he asked me whether I would be willing to risk it, and I said,
what I always did, "Whither thou goest, I will go." Lady Ellenborough
was in a very anxious state when she heard this announcement,
as she knew it was the death-blow to a great source of revenue
to the tribe. She was very intimate with us, and distantly connected
by marriage with my family, and she would have favoured us, if she
could have done it without abolishing the whole system. She did
all she could to dissuade us; she wept over our loss, and she told us
that we should never come back&mdash;indeed, everybody advised us to
make our wills; finally, she offered us the escort of one of her
Mezrabs, that we might steer clear of the Bedawi raids, and be conducted
quicker to water, <i>if it existed</i>. Richard made me a sign
to accept the escort, and we did.</p>

<p>From our earliest married days, one of his peculiarities (used
rather, I suspect, for training me to observe him, and to understand
his wants) would be that he would not tell me directly to do a thing,
but I used to find in a book I was reading, or some drawer that I
opened every day, or in his own room, marked by a weight, a few
words of what he wanted, conveying no direct order, and yet I knew
that it was one. I grew quite accustomed to this, and used regularly
to visit the places where I was likely to find them, and if I missed
there was a sort of "Go seek" expression on his face, that told me
that I had not hunted properly, and I knew (by another expression)
when I had succeeded. I used to call these "African spoors." We
could almost talk before outsiders in this way, without speaking a
word out loud.</p>

<p>On the same principle, he used to teach me to swim without my
arms, and afterwards to swim without my legs, using either one or
the other, but not both, in case of falling out of a steamer and being
entangled.</p>

<p>I mention this, because we always talked before people without
their perceiving it, and he told me in this way exactly what to say
to her; but we provided ourselves with seventeen camels, laden
with water, in case of accident. We had each two horses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
everything necessary for tenting out, and were armed to the teeth.
We had a very picturesque breakfast, affectionate farewells&mdash;the
<i>Mushir</i> and the whole cavalcade to see us out of the town. We
cleared Damascus and its environs by a three hours' march; then
Richard, according to his custom, called a halt, and we camped
out and picketed, because, he said, it would be so easy to send
back for anything, if aught were missing.</p>

<p>We eventually reached Da'as Agha, the Chief of Jerúd, who has a
hundred and fifty fighting men. These little villages in the middle
of a desert are sometimes very acceptable for the renewal of provisions.
This Jerúd was a large one, and was surrounded with salt
and gypsum. After this there was only one more village, Atneh,
till the Great Karryatayn, in the heart of the desert. Here we
were told of some underground curiosities, and we stopped to dig,
and discovered an old catacomb. The women only wear one
garment; they are covered with coins, and bits of stone made into
necklaces and charms against the evil eye. After this we had a long
desert ride, and were caught in a dust-storm. A dust-storm is no
joke; you may lie down and perhaps make your horse lie, and cover
yourself up with rugs, but if it is a bad storm, like a snowstorm,
you may be buried. Richard advised our galloping through it,
laying the reins on the horses' necks, and letting them go where they
would, for, he said, they would know a great deal more than we
should; so, covering our faces up in our <i>kuffíyyehs</i>&mdash;for, as far as heads
and shoulders went, we dressed like natives&mdash;we gave our horses
their heads, and they went at a rattling pace, and about three hours
took us out of the storm. Richard and I were alone; all the rest
lagged behind. When the horses once got out of the storm (they
seemed to understand all about it&mdash;one was desert bred and took
the lead), they relapsed into a walk till they got cool. We then
went by the compass in the direction we meant to take, and were
joined eventually by our followers.</p>

<p>We now had to sleep in our clothes, revolvers and guns at our
sides, and make our men take turn to watch, in case of an attack
from a <i>ghazú</i>, or Bedawi raid, and we took off the camels' bells. A
<i>ghazú</i> may pass you in the night, and if you are quite silent, and a
foal does not whinny, nor a dog bark, you are all right; but those
are the two things you have to dread. I ought to have said that,
though we accepted the escort, we were not hoodwinked. I kept
taking stock of our Mezrab between Damascus and our first halt,
and I thought he had an uncanny and <i>amused</i> look; so I rode up to
Richard, and told him, in a language that was not understood, what
I thought. Richard gave a grim smile, as Ouida says, "under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
moustache," and said, "Yes, I have thought all that out too. Mohammed
Agha, come here."</p>

<p>Whatever Richard told Mohammed to do, he did it thoroughly. If
he wanted a culprit that had run away, he would say, "Bring me So-and-so,
Mohammed." "Eywallah! ya Sidi Beg" (Yes, by Allah, my
Lord Beg); and he would go off, saying, "If he were in hell I would
have him out." Once he brought a man kicking and struggling
under his arm, and put him down before Richard, saying, "There
he is, your Excellency."</p>

<p>This faithful Afghan had served him in India, and he had accidentally
found him in Damascus, and made him his chief <i>kawwás</i>.
He now rode up. Richard gave him a few orders in Afghani, which
no one else understood. He saluted and retired. When we got
about three hours away from Damascus in the open desert, the
Bedawin had his mare and his arms taken from him, and was
mounted on a baggage mule. Every kindness was shown to him,
and he enjoyed every comfort that we had, but two mounted guard
over him day and night, and he was thus powerless. We knew
quite well that the Bedawin, on his thoroughbred mare, would have
curveted off in circles, pretending to look for wells, when in reality he
would have fetched the tribe down upon us, and we should have been
captured; orders would have been given to respect and treat us
well, and then we should have to be ransomed, and this would
have <i>proved</i> the impossibility of visiting Palmyra without a Bedawi
escort at six thousand francs a head, and the Foreign Office would
have smartly reproved, and perhaps recalled, their Consul for running
such a risk. We stuck our Mezrab up for a show, to prove that we
had a Bedawin escort, whenever Bedawi raids were near, but he was
not allowed to move or to make a sign. Da'as joined us with ten
of his men, and whenever there was the smallest occasion for joy
or self-congratulation, they used to do a <i>Jeríd</i>. When I say the men
are riding <i>Jeríd</i>, I mean that they are galloping about violently,
firing from horseback at full speed, yelling, hanging over in their
stirrups with their bridles in their mouth, playing with and quivering
their long feathered lances in the air, throwing them and catching
them again at full gallop, picking things from the ground that
they have thrown there, firing pistols, throwing themselves under the
horses' bellies and firing under them at full gallop, yelling and
shouting their war-cry, as Buffalo Bill's cowboys do, only far more
picturesque figures, with their many-coloured dresses, and better
mounted on their beautiful mares. The wildness of the whole
spectacle is very refreshing; but you have to be a good rider yourself,
as the horses simply go wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion we saw a large body, apparently of mounted
Bedawi. We waved and whistled our stragglers in, and drew up in
line; the others did the same. We fully expected a charge. By this
time I had transformed myself into a boy (Richard's son)&mdash;found
it more convenient for riding long distances, and for running away.
It <i>sounds</i> indecent, but all Arab clothes are so baggy and draping
that it little matters whether you are dressed as a man or woman.
So he let me ride out with two other horsemen from the ranks
forward (it would have been undignified for <i>him</i> to do so, being in
command of the party); they did the same, and this is what it proved
to be&mdash;the Shaykh and his fighting men on the part of a distant
village, and a priest on the part of the Archbishop of Karryatayn,
with invitations. All the men embraced, my hand was kissed, and
we were escorted back in great triumph, riding <i>Jeríd</i> as before. We
rode to the village of the Shaykh, and we sent on others with our
letters to Omar Beg, the Brigadier at that time commanding troops
at Karryatayn, because they expected a revolt of the tribes.</p>

<p>We eventually arrived at Karryatayn. We were treated with great
hospitality by Omar Beg, and when we left he accompanied us a
little way with an immense cavalcade, which was very picturesque
and pretty. We saw a mirage that day in the desert, and were very
tired, and had to sleep with our arms, without undressing. We then
had a somewhat dangerous defile to pass through mountains, where
we found a well. I had invented a capital way of watering the
beasts. Man can always draw water, but nobody thinks of the
horses, and in a cup or tin pot you cannot get enough water for
them. I had bags made of skins, exactly like a huge tobacco-pouch
with ropes, and whenever we came to inaccessible water <i>these</i> were
lowered until every animal had drank its fill. At each of these
places, Jerúd, Atneh, and Karryatayn, several who had been longing
to go to Tadmor wanted to join us, secure of protection, of food
for themselves, and corn for their animals without paying a farthing
for it. We increased to a hundred and sixty persons, and some
had one and some two animals. I had one man with me as my own
servant, a Syrian Christian, who gave us a great deal of trouble.
He was very clever, and the best dancer; but the second or third
day after a hard day's ride, the horses were dead beat, and instead
of taking his horse and watering and feeding it, and putting it in
shelter as I desired, he drew his sword and cut its throat, in hopes
of being allowed to ride my second horse, so I ordered him off
to the baggage in the rear. No Moslem would have done such
a thing. I never liked him after. We could not turn the man out
to die in the desert, but the day that we got back to Damascus, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
husband sent him to prison, for that and thefts in the houses where
we stayed.</p>

<p>We met with another <i>ghazú</i> before we arrived, but we imposed
on them by calling a halt, planting the flag, showing our Bedawin,
and ordering breakfast to be spread. We then improvised a <i>tir</i>
by planting a lance in the sand at a good distance, with a pumpkin
at the top, or an orange, and showed them how far our rifles would
carry, and the <i>ghazú</i> being mounted on mares, not camels, we were
not attacked. A few of ours curveted about, preparatory to bolting,
but my husband called out to the men to form into line, and then
he shouted, "The first man who leaves this line, I'll shoot him in the
back as he rides away." That made them settle down.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Tadmor"></a>Tadmor.</i></div>

<p>The first sight of Palmyra makes you think it is a regiment of
cavalry drawn out in single line on the horizon; it was the most
imposing sight I ever looked upon, though I have seen plenty of
other ruins. It is so gigantic, so extensive, so bare, so desolate, rising
out of, and partially buried in a sea of sand. There is something that
almost takes your breath away about this splendid City of the Dead.
When you are alone and gazing in silence upon her solitary grandeur,
you feel as if you were wandering in some unforgotten world, and respect
and wonder bid you hush like a child amidst the tombs of a
long-closed and forgotten churchyard. This was the Tadmor built
by Solomon, as a safe halt for the treasures of India and Persia
passing through the desert (2 Paralipomenon or Chronicles viii. 4),
"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,
which he built in Hamar." Read also 3 Kings or 1 King ix. 18.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the imposing sight of Tadmor. There is
nothing so deceiving as distance in the desert. At sea you may
calculate it, but in the desert you never can. A distant ruin stands
out of the sea of sand, the atmosphere is so clear that you think you
will reach it in half an hour; you ride all day and you never seem to
get any nearer to it, just as if it receded in proportion as you
advanced. We camped outside, close to the great colonnade. We
had five tents, our free-lances ten, the rest of the party theirs, and
the animals close by. There were four sulphurous streams; we kept
one to drink, and one to bathe, and two for the animals. There is
a height of rock on which is a castle; the mountain-top was cruised
all around with an infinity of labour to form a drawbridge and moat.
The ascent is exceedingly steep. On two sides is a fine range of
mountains, on the other two a desert of sand, stretching far away
like a yellow sea. The ruins and a small oasis caused by the
foundation lie at our feet. It is possible that Tadmor once spread
over all the irrigated part of the plain. A few orchards, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
splendid ruins, and a handful of wretched people have huts
plastered like wasps' nests within them. The whole City must have
been composed of parallel streets, and similar streets crossing them,
some formed by immense columns, and stretching far over the
plains, and cornered by temples and castles. The Temple of the Sun
was carved from great blocks of rock from the mountains; has some
fine cornices, some still perfect. In one direction there is a falling
wall on the slant, as if it was arrested in falling. It has a square court
of seven hundred and forty feet each side, encompassed by a wall
seventy feet high. The central door is thirty-two feet high and
sixteen wide. The temple still has one hundred columns standing.
The few people who live there are disgusting and ophthalmic.</p>

<p>The tombs are a great interest&mdash;tall square towers with a handsome
frontage. Inside are four stories. The ceilings are beautiful; the
entrances are lined with Corinthian columns and busts. There are
tiers to the very top for bodies. One contained one hundred bodies.
One bore a 102 B.C. date, one Anno Domini 2&mdash;evidently a very swell
family, and all speaking of sad ruined grandeur. The ruins are
enormous and extensive, and simply splendid. I cannot describe
the sensation of being in a great City of the Dead, and thinking over
all the story of Zenobia and her capture, especially by moonlight.
The simoom blew our tents nearly down part of the time. Richard
discovered caves, and he spent several days excavating. We found
human curios, human bones, and skulls with hair on them, which
we brought home. There is a sulphurous river, bright as crystal,
and tepid with the properties of Vichy. Water issues from a
cavernous hole in the mountain, and streams through Palmyra. A
separate spring, of the same quality, bubbles up in the sand near
it. The Damascenes send for Vichy water; why don't they get it
from here? We also found some Greek statues; one of Zenobia,
life size. Some of our men were taken with <i>wahteb</i>, a disease
peculiar to Syria, and hereditary&mdash;a sort of convulsions or hysteria.
They generally get a firstborn to tread up and down the back, but
I brought them to quicker with doses of hot brandy and water.
We returned by a different route part of the way. There is a well-known
river and outwork six hours' ride away from Palmyra, called
Selamíyyah, and bearing east-south-east of the Mount of Hamah.
Here begins a high rolling ground called El Aláh, which we come
to later on. We had very bad weather, and our tents were nearly
carried away at night. We had a wild-boar hunt on the way. We
fell in with fifty Bedawi; they were not strong enough to attack us,
but we had to stick to our baggage. Our usual day in the desert
(in which we lived off and on) was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Camp_Life_Our_Travelling_DaymdashNight_Camps"></a>Camp Life&mdash;Our Travelling Day&mdash;Night Camps.</i></div>

<p>The usual travelling day is that those who had anything to do
rose two hours before starting, but those who had not got into their
saddles at dawn. Being, as one may say, head <i>sais</i>, or groom, I saw
the horses groomed, fed, watered, and saddled. Our dragomans<a name="FNanchor_2_161" id="FNanchor_2_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_161" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
attended to striking the tents and the baggage. We started at dawn,
and rode until the sun was unbearable; we then halted for one or
two hours. The animals were ungirthed, fed, and watered, and we
had our food and smoke, and perhaps a short sleep; after which we
mounted, and rode till near sunset. We then halted for the night.
The tents were pitched. If we were near an inhabited place Richard
sat in state on his divan and received the Chiefs with <i>narghíleh</i>
and sherbet; I saluted, and walked off with the horses. I had drilled
my people so well that they were all drawn up in line; at one
word of command, off with the bridles, and on with the head-stalls;
at another word the saddles off, the perspiring backs rubbed
with a handful of <i>raki</i>, to prevent galls, and the horse-cloths thrown
on. They were then led about to cool for a quarter of an hour,
then ridden down to water, if there was any, or watered out of the
skins if there were not, and their nose-bags put on with <i>tibn</i>&mdash;straw
chopped up as fine as mincemeat, the hay of this country&mdash;then
picketed in a ring, heels out, heads in, hobbled fore and aft, and grooms
in the middle.</p>

<p>I would then go back to my husband, and sit on the divan at a respectful
distance and in respectful attitude, speak little, and be invited
to have a sherbet or <i>narghíleh</i>. I then saluted, and went to see the
horses groomed for the night, and get their suppers; then I returned
to my husband's tent, supper and bed, and to-morrow <i>da capo</i>. The
baggage animals, with provisions and water, are directed to a given
place so many hours in advance by the compass. One man of our
riding-party slings on the saddle-bags, containing something to eat
and drink; another hangs a water-melon or two to his saddle, another
the skins to draw water for the horses, and another or two, nose-bags
with corn. We ride on till about eleven, and dismount at the most
convenient place, and water as we go along, if there is any. The
horses' girths are slackened, their bridles changed for halters; they
drink, if possible, and their nose-bags are filled with one measure
of barley. We eat, smoke, and sleep for one hour or two; we then
ride on again till we reach our tents.</p>

<p>We are supposed to find them pitched, mattresses and blankets
spread, mules and donkeys free and rolling to refresh themselves,
baggage stacked, the gypsy-pot over a good fire, and perhaps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
glass of lemonade or a cup of coffee ready for us. It does sometimes
happen that we miss our camp, that we have the ground for
bed, the saddle for pillow, and the water-melon for supper. Richard
used to take all the notes, sketches, observations, and maps, and
gather all the information. The sketches and maps were Charles
Drake's business, when with us. I acted as secretary and aide-de-camp,
and had the care of the stable and any sick or wounded men;
I could also help him with the sextant, and with some of his
scientific instruments.</p>

<p>A short day's riding would be eight hours, a very long one would
be thirteen, and we generally stayed at any place of interest till
it was exhausted. In this way we saw all Syria, Palestine, and
the Holy Land off the beaten tracks, and through the deserts, the
Haurán and wild places included. I do not like to say too much
about it, because my two volumes of "Inner Life of Syria," which
were published in 1875, and "Unexplored Syria," written by Richard,
Charley Drake, and me (2 vols., 1872), have mostly told everything.
These will be republished in the Uniform Library.</p>

<p>Camping out is the most charming thing in the world, and its
scenes will always live in my memory. It is a very picturesque
life, although hard, but one gets so used to it, as quite to dislike a
house. I can never forget some of those lovely nights in the desert,
as after supper we all sat round in circles; the mules, donkeys,
camels, horses, and mares picketed about, screaming, kicking, and
holloaing; the stacked loads, the big fires, the black tents, the
Turkish soldiers, the picturesque figures in every garb, and wild and
fierce-looking men in wonderful costumes lying here and there,
singing and dancing barbarous dances (especially the sword-dance);
or stories told, or Richard reciting the "Arabian Nights," or poor
Palmer chanting Arab poetry, or Charley Drake practising magic to
astonish the Mogháribehs, though neither of these two were with
us <i>then</i>. A glorious moon lights our tripod and kettle; the jackals
howl and chatter as they sniff the savoury bones, and if you can
remain breathless, it is the prettiest thing to see them gambol in the
moonlight, jumping over one another's backs, but if one, smelling
food, runs round your tent when all are asleep, the shadow on the
white canvas is so large that it frightens you. A distant pack coming
along sounds like the war-cry of the Bedawi booming down upon
you; their yell is unearthly as it sweeps by you, passes, and dies
away in the distance. I used to love the sound, because it told me
I was in camp, by far the most delightful form of existence when
the weather is not too cruel.</p>

<p>Madame Omar Beg's two pets were a hyæna, which received me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
at the gate, and a lynx that lay upon the divan. The first put its
fore-paws on my shoulders and smelt my cheek, and did "pouf"
(like a bellows blowing in your face) to frighten me; and the other
sprang at me and mewed and lashed its tail. For sheer fright I
stood stock still and they did nothing to me, and amused Madame
Omar immensely when she came in.</p>

<p>Camel-riding is very pleasant, if it is a <i>delúl</i> with a long trot, but
a slow walk is horribly tedious, a baggage animal is bone-breaking,
and a gallop would be utter annihilation. A <i>shugduf</i> or <i>takhtarawán</i>
shakes you till you are sore. The nicest mount is horse or mare&mdash;mare
safer; but Richard did a very wise thing&mdash;he chose <i>rahwáns</i>.
They run an American trot, and there is no more fatigue in riding
them than sitting in an armchair. You have only to sit still and let
them go, and they cover enormous spaces in the day; so he used
to arrive perfectly fresh when we were all tired out. I possessed
a couple of stallions. I was headstrong and foolish, and I would ride
them, because I hated the <i>rahwáns</i>' paces; so I took a great deal
more out of myself than I need have done, as they generally danced
for a couple of hours before they settled down to their work.
However much you may love the desert and camp life, when you
have had your fill of it, I cannot tell how refreshing it is to see the
first belt of green, like something dark lining the horizon, and to
long to reach it. When you enter by degrees under the trees, the
orchards, the gardens of Damascus, you smell the water from afar,
and you hear its gurgling long before you come to the rills and
fountains; you scent and then see the fruit&mdash;the limes, figs, citron,
water-melon; you feel a madness to jump into the water, to eat your
fill of fruit, to go to sleep under the delicious shade.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Return_Home_after_Desert"></a>Return Home after Desert.</i></div>

<p>Such is entering Damascus. You forget the bitter wind, the scorching
sun, the blistering sand; you wonder if it is true that you are
going to have a bath, to change your clothes, to sleep in a real bed,
without having to watch against Bedawi, or if your brain is hurt by
the sun, or if your blinded eyes are seeing a mirage. Your tired,
drooping horse tells you it is true; he pricks his ears, he wants to
break out into a mild trot; done up as he is, he stops to drink at every
rill, and, with a low whinny of joy, gathers a mouthful of grass at
every crop. You who have never travelled in the desert do not know
what <i>water</i> means. I have seen forty Bedawi race to a hole in a
rock where as much rainwater had gathered as would fill a hand-basin,
fling themselves off their horses, bend and put their lips to
it, and then courteously make way for each other. You will see
people in the East sitting, in what would appear to you a placid
idiotcy of delight, by a little trickling stream not a foot wide, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
a <i>narghíleh</i>, and calling it <i>kayf</i>, which means <i>dolce far niente</i>, or "sweet
do-nothing."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Our House.</span></h4>


<blockquote>

<p>"Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of Spring, blooming
as thine own rosebud, as fragrant as thine own orange flower, O Damascus,
Pearl of the East!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Our house in Damascus overhung the road and opposite gardens,
with projecting lattice windows, was bounded on the right by a
Mosque, on the left by a <i>Hammám</i> (Turkish bath), and front and
back by gardens. On the other side of the road, among the apricot
orchards, I had a capital stable for twelve horses, with a good room
for <i>saises</i> (grooms), and a small garden with the river running
through it. As soon as you got out of our village there was a bit
of desert sand, and a background of tall yellow-coloured mountain,
called Jebel Kaysún, or the Camomile Mountain, and that was what
our village smelt of. When you entered our house, you came into
a square courtyard, coarsely painted in broad stripes of red, white,
and blue. All around were orange, lemon, and jessamine trees, a
fountain playing in the middle, opposite the <i>liwán</i>, a raised room
with one side taken out of it, open on to the court, spread with
carpets and divans, and the niches filled with plants. Here, on hot
days, one receives and offers coffee, lemonade, sherbet, chibouques,
<i>narghílehs</i>, and cigarettes. On one side is a dining-room, on the
other a cool sitting-room; all the rest is for servants and offices.
Upstairs, six rooms run round two sides of the courtyard; a long
terrace occupies the other two sides, joining and opening into the
room at either end. There is a cool house-top with plants, to spread
mats and divans, to sit amongst the flowers under the trees and
by the Mosque-minaret, to look either towards our mountain, or over
Damascus and the gardens, and inhale the desert-air from the other
side of Damascus.</p>

<p>We also made a beautiful arbour in the garden opposite, which
contained chiefly roses and jessamine. By lifting up the overladen
vines and citrons, and branches of the lemon and orange trees, and
supporting them on a frame-work, so that no sun could penetrate
their luxuriance; we had a divan made under them for the cool
summer evenings near the rushing river, and many happy hours of
<i>kayf</i> we passed there. The Mosque next door to us, seemed to
be built round and clung to a huge vine tree, which spread up and
down all over it and its terrace, and the <i>Muezzin's</i> Minaret and my
study window were cheek by jowl. The village was charming&mdash;domes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
and minarets peeping out of trees, bubbling streams, the
music of the water-wheel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Native_Life"></a>Native Life.</i></div>

<p>Whenever we were in Eastern life, whether in Syria or elsewhere,
we always made a point of being thoroughly English and European
in our Consulate; but, when <i>not</i> obligatory, we used to live a great
deal <i>with</i> the natives, and <i>as</i> the natives, for the purpose of experience.
We wore European dress in Damascus and Beyrout, and we wore
native dress up the country or in the desert. It was as easy for me
to wear men's dress as my own, because it was all drapery, and does not
in the least show the figure. There is nothing but the face to tell
by, and if you tuck up your <i>kuffíyyah</i> you show only half a face, or only
the eyes. Thus we would eat what they ate. If I went to stay with
a harem, I always went in my own clothes; but if I went to the
bazar, I frequently used to dress like a Moslemah with my face
covered, and sit in the shops in the bazar, and let my Arab maid do
all the talking lest I might be suspected, that I might hear all the
gossip, and enter something into their lives. And the women frequently
took me into the mosques in the same way, knowing who
I was.</p>

<p>We attended <i>every sort</i> of ceremony, whether it was a circumcision,
or a wedding, or a funeral, or a dervishes' dance, or anything that
was going on, or any religious ceremony&mdash;my husband to the Cafés and
the Mosques, the evening story-tellers' haunts; I to the charm shops,
where the <i>khosis</i> (fortune-tellers) hang out and administer love philters
or, in short, every sort of thing, and mix with all classes, religions, and
races and tongues. My husband's friendship with Mohammedans,
and his knowledge of Arabic and Persian, the language of literature,
put him in intimate relation with the Arab tribes and all the chief
authorities, and the <i>only man</i> who could not get on with him was
the Turkish <i>Wali</i>, or Governor-General, Rashíd Pasha.</p>

<p>I cannot do better than copy Spyr. R. Lambros's letter describing
the Arabic Library at Damascus, which was a rich find for Richard:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The library was founded by the Ommayads. The building is
situate near the stately Djami which bears their name. It has a
great stone vault supported upon four columns, and ornamented with
mosaics. Not so long ago it was restored with much taste under
the superintendence of the Governor of Syria, Achmet Hamdi Pasha,
a favourite of the Sultan Abdul Hamid. There is no proper catalogue
of this library, nor is it arranged. Several of the manuscripts
are moth-eaten and much injured by damp. Still there exist in it
valuable papyri, as well as manuscripts on parchment and paper.
Among them, according to M. Papadopulos, a conspicuous place is
due to a history of Damascus in nineteen large volumes. A great deal
that is new is to be found in them regarding the City and its walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
as well as about the fine arts in Damascus. This codex is a jewel of
Arabic literature, and an inexhaustible source for the whole annals
of the city.</p>

<p>"The collection of old Arabic papyri is rich. There are several
that throw light on obscure periods of Arabic history and poetry, or
deal with the general history of Arabs and their literature. 'Some
of these papyri are as late as the fifteenth century, and may be
considered,' says M. Papadopulos, 'as copies of various monuments
in stone.' On papyrus rolls are to be found whole collections of
poems by celebrated Arab authors, of whom Ibn Khaldoun is the
most notable. Others contain decrees of the Emirs of Damascus.</p>

<p>"M. Papadopulos mentions also a history on parchment of the
Tartars, by Abulghazi Bahadur, and a history and geography of
Damascus and Palmyra, by Abulfeda. Although M. Papadopulos
gives no details regarding these writings, one can identify the history
of Abulghazi as that which was discovered by Swedish officers in
the captivity after the battle of Pultowa, 1709, and translated into
German, and subsequently (1726) into French, and published in two
volumes under the title of 'Histoire Généalogique des Tatars.'
Regarding the work of Abulfeda one cannot, from the brief notice
that M. Papadopulos supplies, come to any certain conclusion,
whether it be a portion of the 'Annales Moslemici' or an unpublished
production of the celebrated Mohammedan prince and polyhistor.</p>

<p>"Among the other treasures of the library are a treatise of Abul-Hassan,
the Arabian astronomer of the thirteenth century; a roll
of Abumazar, the astronomer (<i>circa</i> 855), on the observatories
at Bagdad and Damascus; a medical treatise of the teacher of Avicenna,
Abu-Sahaal; a meteorological bulletin relating to Damascus,
by Abul-Chaiz; papyrus rolls containing the Pentateuch, the Psalter,
and the Gospels, in Kufic characters; papyrus rolls and others, consisting
of Plato's 'Laws,' in Arabic, the 'Organon' of Aristotle, the
work of Hippocrates, 'De Aëre, Aquis, et Locis,' and one containing
some portions of the 'Birds' of Aristophanes (in Arabic?), and presenting
variants from the received text, and the Bible, in Syriac.</p>

<p>"But the great prize of the library, so far as one can judge from
the inadequate description given of it, is a Greek manuscript of the
Old and New Testament, comprising the Epistle of Barnabas and
a portion of the Shepherd of Hermas. As the discovery of it is
highly interesting, I will give an exact translation of the passage
referring to it.</p>

<p>"'One of the most important of the so-called uncial manuscripts,
which contain the whole of the New Testament complete, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The manuscript is written on well-prepared parchment, and is
12½ inches wide and 13¾ inches tall. It consists of 380½ leaves,
of which 200 contain the Old Testament (in the Septuagint version)
incomplete; but 180 the whole of the New Testament, the Epistle
of Barnabas, and a large portion of the Shepherd of Hermas. The
manuscript is divided into four columns, and in each column there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
are fifty lines. This manuscript may be regarded as similar to the
Codex Sinaiticus, and consequently is worthy of a searching inquiry
and investigation. The discovery of this gem is due to us.'</p>

<p>"Every reader will see that it is really a gem. Not only is the
mere antiquity of the manuscript a point of importance, but also
the fact that it contains a portion, and a considerable portion, of
the Shepherd of Hermas, which has lately been seen in a new light,
thanks to the researches and criticisms of scholars like Hilgenfeld
and Harnack. It is well known that Hilgenfeld maintained that he
had found the Greek conclusion, still missing, of Hermas, in a
London publication of the well-known forger, Constantin Simonides
(Nutt, 1859). This supposed conclusion was, after the appearance,
simultaneously with Professor Hilgenfeld's conjecture, of the collation
of the Athos Codex by Lambros, accompanied by an introduction
by Mr. Armitage Robinson, utterly rejected by Professor
Harnack, and declared to be a pure forgery of Simonides&mdash;an opinion
in which I concur. Now comes the ancient manuscript from Damascus
as a new document. Does it contain the conclusion of the Shepherd?
Unfortunately the meagre notice supplied by M. Papadopulos neither
throws light on this point nor affords us sufficient information, nor
does it allow us to form any certain opinion on the whole question
of the importance of the Damascene Codex and its similarity to the
Sinaitic, which also contains, besides the Testament, a small portion
of the Shepherd. I hope, however, to be soon in a position to give
further intelligence on this important discovery.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Environs_of_Damascus"></a>The Environs of Damascus.</i></div>

<p>The small rides and excursions round Damascus are innumerable
and beautiful; they lead through garden and orchard with bubbling
water, under the shady fig and vine, pomegranate and walnut. You
emerge on the soft yellow sand, and you throw off your superfluous
strength, by galloping as hard as you will. There is no one to check
your spirits; the breath of the desert is liberty. There is Mizzeh, a
village placed exactly on the borders of the green and yellow; one
side looks into trees and verdure, and the other side in the bare
sand. After that, you get into the desert, and to Kataná, a village
three hours away, and Hamáh. Jeramánah is a Druze village.
Jobar is a Moslem village with a synagogue, dedicated to Elijah,
and is a pilgrimage for Damascus Jews, and built over a cave, where
they believe the prophet used to hide in time of persecution. A railed-off
space showed where he anointed Hazael. When the prophet
was at Horeb, "the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to
the wilderness of Damascus, and when thou comest, anoint Hazael
to be King over Syria" (1 Kings xix. 15). Burzeh is a beautiful
little village almost hidden under the mountain, nestling in verdure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
and partly hidden by a cliff at the mouth of the glen. A Moslem
Wely, called Makám Ibrahím (place of Abraham), assembles thousands
of pilgrims on its festival day, where they practise the <i>Da'aseh</i>,
meaning the treading&mdash;that is, the Shaykh riding over the prostrate
bodies of the Faithful without hurting them&mdash;as at Cairo. Josephus,
or rather Nicolaus of Damascus, says, "Abraham reigned at
Damascus, being a foreigner who came with an army out of the land
above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldean, but after a long time
he got up and removed from that country, also with his people, and
went into the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea. Now,
the name of Abraham is still famous in the country of Damascus,
and there is shown a village named from him 'the habitation of
Abraham,' and Burzeh is this village." It is still disputed whether
Burzeh or Jobar is the true site of Hobah. These rides will take
you from our mountain in a semicircle all round Damascus (at the
distance of about an hour and a half from Damascus during the
whole time), which is in our centre.</p>

<p>The longer excursions are the Convent of Saídnaya, considered
by the Greeks to be Ptolemy's Danaba. There are also the Rock-tombs
and temples of Menin Helbon, said to be the Chalybon of
the Bible, once famed for its wine, exported to Tyre, noted by
Ezekiel and Strabo, and horrible stuff it is, if it was the same as it
is now. Then there is the village of Dhumayr, which contains a
well-preserved temple, built in A.D. 246. This is the first day's
station for the Baghdad camel-post, which Richard was responsible
for. About two miles eastward of that, and at the foot of the lowest
range of Anti-Lebanon, called Jebel el-Kaus, are the ruins of a little
town and fort deserted for centuries. The desert of Arabia stretches
right away to the east and south-east.</p>

<p>These are the little and middling runs. It was very pleasant for
us, as we used to get acquainted with all the Shaykhs and people
for two or three days' ride all round Damascus, and if we felt
dull&mdash;which, by the way, we never did&mdash;we could run out and pay
them a visit, such as Shaykh Sali's camp, passing El Bassúleh to
Hijáneh. Lakes are marked on the maps a day's journey from
Damascus. There are four lakes supposed to receive the Abana
and Pharphar, but they are generally dry, the rivers evaporating or
disappearing in the sand. You ride across the Ghutah plain, the
Merj, and Abbs (the plains of Damascus) into the Wady el Ajam. It
is also pleasant to ride down to the coast, seventy-two miles, and take
a steamer going to Tyre, Sidon, and other coast places.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="How_our_Days_were_passed"></a>How our Days were passed.</i></div>

<p>Richard's day, as I said, was divided into reading, writing, studying,
and attending to his official work. There was one kind of duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
within the town, another without the town, to scour mountain and
desert, to ride hard, and to know everything that is going on in the
country, and <i>personally</i>, not through dragomans only. His talents
were particularly Eastern, and of a political and diplomatic kind; his
knowledge of Eastern character was as perfect as his languages. He
was as much needed out of the town as in it, and very often when they
thought he was far away, he was amongst them, and they wondered
how he knew things. I interested myself in all his pursuits, and I
was a most fortunate woman that he allowed me to be his companion,
his secretary, and his aide-de-camp. I looked after our house,
servants, stables, and animals. I did a little gardening. I helped my
husband, read and wrote, studied Arabic, received and returned visits,
saw and learnt Damascus through, till I knew it like my own pocket,
looked after the poor and sick of my village and its environs. Sometimes
I galloped over the plains, and sat in the Bedawi tents, sometime
went up all the mountains. Summer times I smoked <i>narghílehs</i>
by the waterside in a neighbour's garden. Sometimes I went to pass
two or three days with a harem. Our lives were wild, romantic,
and solemn. After sunset the only sounds were the last call to
prayer on the Minaret top, the howling of the wild dogs, the cries of
the jackals in the burial-ground outside the village, the bubbling of
the fountains, the hootings of the owls in the garden, the soughing of
the wind through the mountain gorges, and the noise of the water-wheel
in a neighbour's orchard. There was often a free fight in the
road below, to steal a mare, or to kill. We have often gone down to
take some poor wretch in, and bind up his sabre-cuts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Reception_Day"></a>Our Reception Day.</i></div>

<p>I used to have a large reception every Friday, and not only of the
Europeans, but the Authorities as well as the natives of every tongue,
race, and creed, who used to assemble in our Divan for <i>narghílehs</i>,
sherbet, and coffee. It used to begin at sunrise, and go on till
sunset. How I look back to those romantic days when the assembled
party, being afraid to remain in our quarters after the sun was down,
used to file down through the orchards and gardens to the safe
shelter of the Damascus gates at sunset, and the mattresses and
cushions of the divans were spread on the housetop, backed by the
romantic Jebel Kaysún, with a bit of desert sand between it and us,
and on all the other three sides a view over Damascus, and its surrounding
oasis, and the desert beyond!</p>

<p>Then the supper was prepared on the roof, and there remained
with us the two most interesting and remarkable characters of
Damascus, the two who never knew what fear meant&mdash;the famous
Abd el Kadir and Lady Ellenborough, known there as the "Hon.
Jane Digby el Mezrab." Abd el Kadir was a dark, handsome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
thoroughbred-looking man, with dignified bearing and cool self-possession.
He dressed in snowy white, both turban and burnous.
Not a single ornament except his jewelled arms, which were
splendid. If you saw him on horseback you would single him
out from a million; he had the seat of a gentleman and a soldier.
He was every inch a Sultan. His mind was as beautiful as
his face. He spoke the perfection of Arabic, he was a true
Moslem, and he and Richard were both Master-Sufi. All readers
will know his history. He was the fourth son of the Algerine
Marabout Abd el Kadir Mahi ed Din, and was born in 1807. You
all remember his hopeless struggles for the independence of Algeria,
his capture, his imprisonment in France from 1847 to 1852&mdash;a
treacherous act, and a tarnish to the French Government. Lord
Londonderry earnestly entreated Louis Napoleon to set him free,
which he did, going to the prison himself to let him out, and treating
him with the greatest honour. He pensioned him and sent him to
Damascus, where he was surrounded by five hundred faithful Algerines.
He divided his time into prayer, study, business, and very little
sleep. He loved the English, but he was loyal to Louis Napoleon.
When the massacre in 1860 took place, he used to sleep at his
own door, lest any poor Christian wretch should knock and petition
to be saved from slaughter, and for fear his Algerines, being Moslems,
should turn a deaf ear; and he saved many, sending guards down to
the convents of women, and to his friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Most_Interesting_and_Remarkable_Woman"></a>A Most Interesting and Remarkable Woman.</i></div>

<p>Our other friend was the Hon. Jane Digby, of the family of Lord
Digby, married to Lord Ellenborough, and divorced. She made
her home in Damascus, and eventually married a Bedawin Shaykh
(Mijwal el Mezrab), the tribe of Mezrab being a branch of the great
Anazeh. She was a most beautiful woman, though at the time I
write she was sixty-one, tall, commanding, and queen-like. She was
<i>grande dame au bout des doigts</i>, as much as if she had just left the
salons of London and Paris, refined in manner and voice, nor did
she ever utter a word you could wish unsaid. My husband said she
was out and out the cleverest woman he ever met; there was
nothing she could not do. She spoke nine languages perfectly, and
could read and write in them. She painted, sculptured, was musical.
Her letters were splendid; and if on business, there was never a
word too much, nor a word too little. She had had a most romantic,
adventurous life, and she was now, one might say, Lady Hester
Stanhope's successor. She lived half the year in a romantic house
she had built for herself in Damascus, and half her life she and her
husband lived in his Bedawi tents, she like any other Bedawin
woman, but honoured and respected as the queen of her tribe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
wearing one blue garment, her beautiful hair in two long plaits
down to the ground, milking the camels, serving her husband, preparing
his food, giving him water to wash his hands and face, sitting
on the floor and washing his feet, giving him his coffee, his sherbet,
his <i>narghílehs</i>, and while he ate she stood and waited on him, and
glorying in it; and when in Damascus they led semi-European lives.
She looked splendid in Oriental dress, and if you saw her as a
Moslem woman in the bazar you would have said she was not more
than thirty-four years of age. She was my most intimate friend,
and she dictated to me the whole of her biography, beginning 15th
March, 1871, and ending July 7th.</p>

<p>After I left a report came home that she was dead. I answered
some unpleasant remarks in the Press about her, throwing a halo
over her memory, in which I stated that I being the possessor of
the biography, no one had a right to say anything about her except
myself. She reappeared again, having only been detained in the
desert by the fighting of the tribes. Her relatives attacked her for
having given me the biography, and she, under pressure, denied it
in print through one of the missionaries, and then wrote and asked
me to give it back to her; but I replied that she should have had
it with the greatest pleasure, only having "given me the lie" in
print, I was obliged for my own sake to keep it, and she eventually
died. I have got it now, but I shall never publish it.</p>

<p>After this episode of my being publicly attacked about her biography,
<i>Chambers' Journal</i>, September 9th, 1876, produced the
following notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Romantic_History"></a>A Romantic History.</i></div>

<p>"Jane Elizabeth, Lady Ellenborough, if we may trust the matter-of-fact
pages of Lodge's 'Peerage,' is the only sister of the present
Lord Digby, being daughter of the late Admiral Sir Henry Digby,
G.C.B., great-grandson of the fifth Lord Digby; her mother was a
daughter of Thomas William Coke, of Holkham, the veteran M.P.
for Norfolk, and well-known agriculturist, afterwards created Earl of
Leicester. She was born in April, 1807, and when little more than
seventeen, was married to the late Lord Ellenborough (the Governor-General
of India); but the union was dissolved by Act of Parliament
in 1830.</p>

<p>"The rumour of her death was effectually contradicted a few
months later by a letter in her own handwriting, addressed to an
English lady, who was well acquainted with her in Damascus. This
lady and her husband had mourned old Lady Ellenborough for two
or three months as having died in the desert, and had quite given
up all hope of ever seeing her again, when one day she received
from her a letter stating that she was alive and in the best of health,
and asking her to contradict the rumour of her decease.</p>

<p>'Lady Ellenborough was fortunate in the possession of at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
one sincere friend, generously eager to defend her when attacked,
and to make out the best case possible for her. Mrs. Isabel Burton,
who had been intimately acquainted, and in the habit of daily
intercourse with this extraordinary woman, during a residence of
some years in Damascus, while her husband, Captain Burton, was
the English Consul at that city, appears to have contracted a warm
attachment for her, and speaks of her, in spite of all her faults, in
terms of the highest praise. To Mrs. Burton Lady Ellenborough
confided the task of writing her biography, and dictated it to her
day by day until the task was accomplished. In a letter to the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, written in March, 1873, when under the belief
that Lady Ellenborough was dead, Mrs. Burton says, in allusion to
this biography, 'She did not spare herself, dictating the bad with
the same frankness as the good. I was pledged not to publish this
until after her death and that of certain near relatives.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Burton subsequently adds, 'I cannot meddle with the
past without infringing on the biography confided to me; but I can
say a few words concerning her life, dating from her arrival in the
East, as told me by herself and by those now living there; and I
can add my testimony as to what I saw, which I believe will interest
every one in England, from the highest downwards, and be a
gratification to those more nearly concerned. About sixteen years
ago, tired of Europe, Lady Ellenborough conceived the idea of
visiting the East, and of imitating Lady Hester Stanhope and Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu, not to mention a French lady, Mdme.
de la Tour d'Auvergne, who has built herself a temple on the top
of Mount Olivet, and lives there still. Lady Ellenborough arrived
at Beyrout and went to Damascus, where she arranged to go to
Baghdad across the Desert. A Bedouin escort for this journey was
necessary; and as the Mezrab tribe occupied the ground, the duty
of commanding the escort devolved upon Shaykh Mijwal, a younger
brother of Shaykh Mohammed, chief of this tribe, which is a branch
of the great Anezeh tribe. On the journey the young Shaykh fell in
love with this beautiful woman, who possessed all the qualities that
could fire the Arab imagination. Even two years ago she was more
attractive than half the young girls of our time. It ended by his
proposing to divorce his Moslem wives and to marry her; to pass
half the year in Damascus&mdash;which to him was like what London or
Paris would be to us&mdash;for her pleasure, and half in the Desert to
lead his natural life. The romantic picture of becoming a Queen
of the Desert and of the Bedouin tribes exactly suited her wild
fancies, and was at once accepted; and she was married, in spite
of all opposition made by her friends and the British Consulate.
She was married according to Mohammedan law, changed her name
to that of the Honourable Mrs. Digby El Mezrab, and was horrified
when she found that she had lost her nationality by her marriage,
and had become a Turkish subject. For fifteen years she lived
as she died,<a name="FNanchor_3_162" id="FNanchor_3_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_162" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the faithful and affectionate wife of the Shaykh, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
whom she was devotedly attached. Half the year was passed in
a very pretty house, which she built at Damascus just without
the gates of the City; and the other six months were passed,
according to his nature, in the Desert in the Bedouin tents of
the tribe.</p>

<p>"'In spite of this hard life, necessitated by accommodating herself
to his habits&mdash;for they were never apart&mdash;she never lost anything of
the English lady, nor the softness of a woman. She was always
a perfect lady in sentiment, voice, manners, and speech. She
never said or did anything could wish otherwise. She kept all her
husband's respect, and was the Mother and the Queen of his tribe.
In Damascus we were only nineteen Europeans, but we all flocked
around her with affection and friendship. The natives did the
same. As to strangers, she received only those who brought a letter
of introduction from a friend or relative; but this did not hinder
every ill-conditioned passer-by from boasting of his intimacy with
the House of Mezrab, and recounting the untruths which he invented,
<i>pour se faire valoir</i>, or to sell his book or newspaper at a better
profit. She understood friendship in its best and fullest sense, and
for those who enjoyed her confidence it was a treat to pass the
hours with her. She spoke French, Italian, German, Slav, Spanish,
Arabic, Turkish, and Greek, as she spoke her native tongue. She
had all the tastes of a country life, and occupied herself alternately
with painting, sculpture, music, or with her garden-flowers, or
poultry, or with her thoroughbred Arab mares, or in carrying out
some improvement. She was thoroughly a connoisseur in each of
her amusements or occupations. To the last she was fresh and
young; beautiful, brave, refined, and delicate. She hated all that
was false. Her heart was noble; she was charitable to the poor.
She regularly attended the Protestant church, and often twice on
Sundays. She fulfilled all the duties of a good Christian lady and
an Englishwoman. She is dead. All those who knew her in her
latter days will weep for her. She had but one fault (and who
knows if it was hers?), washed out by fifteen years of goodness and
repentance. Let us hide it, and shame those who seek to drag up
the adventures of her wild youth to tarnish so good a memory.
<i>Requiescat in pace.</i>'</p>

<p>"But Lady Ellenborough was <i>not</i> dead. It will, of course, be
obvious that, along with Lord Brougham, she has been privileged to
read the obituary notice of her own career; and she is probably
destined to see many more summers and winters in her Arab
home.</p>

<p>"It is evident, from the tenor of the last few sentences of the
foregoing letter, that the 'one fault' to which the writer alludes was
the elopement of Lady Ellenborough with Prince Schwartzenberg,
and that Mrs. Burton entirely disbelieves in the half-dozen or more
of apocryphal husbands intervening between Lord Ellenborough and
the Arab sheikh. At any rate, the eccentric lady is entitled to the
benefit of the doubt; and public curiosity respecting this extraordinary
woman must remain unsatisfied until the period shall arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
when her friend and confidante, Mrs. Burton, will be at liberty to
publish the autobiography committed to her charge.</p>

<p>"It would be possible, without difficulty, to draw at once a parallel
and a contrast between the eccentric Lady Ellenborough and the
scarcely less eccentric niece of the younger Pitt, Lady Hester
Stanhope, whom I have named above, and who, more than half a
century ago, exchanged English life, habits, and sentiments, and
possibly also to some extent her faith as well, for those of the wild
and romantic East."</p></blockquote>

<p>The others, besides Richard and myself, on the house roof were
frequently Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake, an indefatigable worker in the
Palestine Exploration; and E. H. Palmer, afterwards professor of
Arabic at Cambridge, and in 1882 murdered by the Bedawi in
Arabia. We were six, and I need not say how romantic those
evenings were, what a halo my memory throws around them,
what conversation, what real adventures, real life, real wit, real
spirituality we enjoyed; and we often stayed there till the moon was
on the wane. The two Englishmen were living with us, and Abd el
Kadir, with an escort of his Algerines, who were picketed in our
court, would see the lady home on his road to his own palace. Now
I am the only survivor of those happy meetings.</p>

<p>Richard's love for children was quite extraordinary. If there was
a child in the room, even a baby in arms, no one could get a word
out of him; but you would find him on the floor, romping with them,
and they were never afraid of him. I do not think there could
possibly be a better illustration than the very admirable and striking
account given by Salih, who was one of the missionaries in
Damascus:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<i>Burton at Damascus.</i></h4>


<p>"My first sight of Captain Burton revealed not only the man in
his complex character, but supplied the key to the perplexing vicissitudes
of his extraordinary career.</p>

<p>"On his arrival in Damascus, Burton called at my house. My
study adjoined the drawing-room, into which he was shown by a
native servant. I heard him command the Arab to fetch me in
harsh, peremptory tones, which were meant to be obeyed. The
servant, not thinking that I was in the study, went to seek me elsewhere.
I advanced, in noiseless Damascus slippers, to the drawing-room
door, and I came upon a scene never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>"At one side of the room stood my curly-headed, rosy-cheeked little
boy of five, on the other side stood Burton. The two were staring at
each other. Neither was aware of my presence. Burton had twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
his face into the most fiendish-like aspect. His eyes rolled, exposing
the whites in an alarming manner. The features were drawn to one
side, so as to make the gashes on his jaw and brow appear more
ghastly. The two cheeks were blown out, and Burton, raising a
pocket-handkerchief to his left cheek, struck his right with the flat
of his right hand, thus producing an explosion, and making the
pocket-handkerchief fly to the left as if he had shot it through his
two cheeks.</p>

<p>"The explosion was followed by a suppressed howl, something
between the bark of a hyæna and a jackal. All the time Burton
glared on the little fellow with the fiery eyes of a basilisk, and the
child stood riveted to the floor as if spell-bound and fascinated,
like a creature about to be devoured. Suddenly a very wonderful
thing happened. The little boy, with a wild shout of delight, sprang
into the monster's arms, and the black beard was instantly mingled
with the fair curls, and Burton was planting kisses all over the flaxen
pate. The whole pantomime was gone through as quick as lightning,
and Burton, disentangling himself, caught sight of my Arab
returning without me, and, instead of waiting for an explanation,
hurled at him a volley of exasperating epithets, culled from the rich
stores of spicy and stinging words which garnish Arabic literature.
Burton had revealed himself to me fully before he saw me. The
child's clear, keen instinct did not mislead it. The big, rough
monster had a big child's heart behind the hideous grimaces. The
child's unerring instinct was drawn by affinity to the child's heart
in the man."</p></blockquote>

<p>During our time a very interesting episode occurred at Damascus&mdash;a
sad one, too. Lord and Lady Langdale had a daughter who
was married to Count Téleki. It was not a very happy marriage.
She made a journey to Syria and Palestine with her mother, a very
nice cousin, and a young friend of his, for diversion. Like many
travellers, unused to sun, hard riding, bad water, exposure, and
fatigue, she got the usual fever and dysentery, and was brought
down in a dying state to Damascus. She was of Agnostic principles,
but in her last few hours she desired to be baptized a Catholic. I
did all I could for her in the way of nursing, and Richard as far as
his power went. When she died, her desk was found to contain a
letter which had been written years before, when she had been very
much excited by reading Buckle's "History of Civilization," and she
wrote, "Should I die at Damascus, I should like to be buried by
Buckle." It so happened that there was place for two next to
Buckle, and she was buried there&mdash;a most impressive and touching
funeral. Her coffin was covered with the Union Jack; Richard and
all his dragomans and <i>kawwáses</i>, in full uniform, were present; and
some time after, appeared the following note in a newspaper:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Buckle's Grave.</span></h4>


<p>"The London correspondent of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> says,
'A traveller just arrived in London from Damascus gives some rather
interesting details about the present condition and surroundings of
Buckle's grave. Though it was left for so long after his death, without
a stone even to mark it, that it had the altar-tomb of white marble
and black basalt that was at length erected, and was now enclosed
in a high wall with a padlocked gate. Next to Buckle's tomb are
the tombs of two rather remarkable women. The first is that of
the Countess Téleki (a daughter, I believe, of Lord Langdale), who
especially desired that her grave should be next to Buckle's; and
the next tomb is that of Lady Ellenborough, erected by her brother,
Lord Digby, with an Arabic inscription from the Korán, placed on
it by her later husband, the Arab sheikh, in singular proximity to
the cross which forms part of the monument. On Buckle's tomb
also, on which, however, there is no cross, there is an Arabic
inscription, suggested by the famous Emir Abd el Kadir.'"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Notes_on_our_Wilder_Travels"></a>Richard's Notes on our Wilder Travels.</i></div>

<p>Each year in January we rode out with the Meccan Caravan, or
Haj, as far as Ramsah, the third station, and one year returned to
Damascus <i>viâ</i> Izra (the Edhra of the Handbook) and the celebrated
Haurán valley plain, inspecting the chief settlements and making
acquaintance with the principal Shaykhs. Richard writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had business at Hums (Emesa), generally written Homs, and
Hamáh (Hamath Epiphaneia), on the northern borders of the consular
district of Damascus. From there I examined and sent home
native facsimiles of the four unique basaltic stones, whose characters,
raised in cameo, apparently represent a system of local hieroglyphics
peculiar to this part of Syria, and form the connecting link between
picture-writing and the true syllabarium. A friend was kind enough
to give me some valuable papers, amongst them two maps noting
the most important of the three hundred and sixty villages, which
he had traced himself by aid of native information. These stud the
plain known as El'Aláh; the same number of villages are allotted to
the Lejá. This plain is a high rolling ground beginning at Selamíyyah,
the well-known ruin and outwork of Palmyra, six hours' ride
from, and bearing east-south-east of the Mound of Hamáh. It extends
five days' journey to the north, and from east to west two or
three days'. Some call it the 'Great Syrian Desert;' but the Seleucidæ
here kept their immense studs of elephants and horses. The
whole is virgin ground, as are also the eastern slopes of the Jebel
Kalbíyyah, on the left bank of the Orontes, and of the country
extending from the parallel of Hums to that of Selamíyyah. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
first five hours we had examined five ruins; and the basaltic buildings
are exactly those of the Giant Cities of Bashan. We returned
to Damascus by Jebel el Hulah; saw the fine crusading castle called
Husn el Akrád, the plain of the Nahr el Kabír, the Eleutherus river.
Our hardships were considerable; the country was under water, and
the rushing torrents and deep ditches caused long detours. We had
heavy and continuous rains, furious blasts, snow and sleet like
Norway. One of the followers sickened and died, and we were all
frostbitten. In all my trips and peregrinations, I had business to
do as well as pleasure.</p>

<p>"Throughout Syria, when the basaltic soil runs to any depth, the
earth is loose and treacherous, fatiguing to traverse in summer, and
impassable in winter. In some places the water is sulphurous or
brackish, but in most places without any unpleasant taste; it is
strongly diuretic."</p></blockquote>


<h4><span class="smcap">Unexplored Syria.</span></h4>


<p>Taken from Richard's journals of excursions to the Libanus with
Charley Drake and me, and once with Drake alone, the Tulúl el
Safá, the Anti-Libanus, the Northern Libanus, and the 'Aláh. We
collected eighty-one original Greek inscriptions in the Haurán
mountain, and in the 'Aláh, a collection of Alpine plants from the
Libanus, shells, and geological specimens. Charley Drake did the
plans and sketches and maps, Richard and I the writing.</p>

<p>Richard wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Tulul_el_Safa"></a>The Tulúl el Safá.</i></div>

<p>"The fact was we had long been tantalized by the sight of
the forbidden Tulúl el Safá, or Hillocks of the Safá Pyramids,
looking at the distance like baby finger-tops, dotting the eastern
horizon within sight of our housetop, and, thinning out northwards,
prolonged the lumpy blue wall of the Jebel Durúz Haurán, which
appears to reflect the opposite line of the Anti-Libanus. Many also
were the vague and marvellous reports which had reached our ears
concerning a cave called by the few who knew it Umm Nírán, the
mother of fires. The difficulty and danger of visiting these places
arose in my time simply from the relations of the <i>Wali's</i> government
with the hill tribes of Bedawin, who, mixed up with the Druzes, infest
the Trachonic countries. The hill tribes proper are Agaylát, the
Hasan, the Shurafát, the Azámát, and the Masá'id. The Safá is
tenanted by the Shitayá, the Ghiyás, and the Anjad, whilst the Lejá
belongs to the Sulút, as clients of the Druzes. These are nine hordes
intermarried, who combine together in the warfare of the tribes.
They are the liege descendants of the refractory robbers of the
Trachonitis, who, to revenge the death of their Captain Naub, rose
up against the garrison of three thousand Idumæans stationed in
their country by Herod, son of Antipater. Their prowess as
plunderers is still famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the scandal of every honest man, they are allowed to scour
the plains, carry off the flocks, and harry the flocks and herds of the
peasantry. They served as ready implements of revenge against all
those disaffected to or disliked by the petty autocrat [Rashíd Pasha]
who then disgraced the land by his rule. They are small and slightly
made, with oval face, bright brown eyes, and restless roving look of
the civilized pickpocket. The features high and well formed, the skin
a clear olive yellow. They wear long love-locks of raven-wings' tint,
well buttered. Their dress scanty and irregular. The action, like
the eyes, is wild and startled; the voice is a sort of bark. When
attacked, they put the women, children, and cattle in the rear, form
a rude line, carefully guard against being out-flanked, and advance
file-firing with great regularity. They attack strangers, and they
have no sense of hospitality, and for this reason it was not really
safe to ride alone three hours beyond the Eastern gate of Damascus.
The Subá'a, therefore, made the plain of Damascus a battle-field,
and the Wuld Ali levied black-mail in Cœle-Syria.</p>

<p>"Dust was thrown in the eyes of the civilized world whilst the
<i>Wali</i> employed hordes of banditti to plunder its own hapless subjects,
whilst the satellites had the audacity to publish, 'Le désert est
cultivé, les Bedouins sont soumis, et le brigandage anéanti.' So it
came to pass that all the broken-down Gassanian convents had
never to our knowledge been visited by any European traveller. Mr.
Porter was told that a hundred horsemen would not attempt a
journey to El Diyúrá. We received no damage, and nighted in
the old temple of Ba'al, called Harrán el'Awámid. However, the
Ghiyás found us out, advanced in a steady line, treated us to a
shower of bullets, severely wounding in the leg our gallant companion
and friend, Bedr Beg. As we were well mounted and armed,
and the riding ground good, we could have brought down as many
of them as we pleased, for we were all armed with six-shooters, and
eight shot rifles, but, as we wanted to avoid a blood-feud, we did not
return fire. After Rashíd Pasha was gone, the mystery of their
attacking us was cleared up.</p>

<p>"These convents are in an excellent state of preservation. What
we have to complain of is that the spirit of clique too often succeeds
in ignoring the real explorer, the true inventor, the most learned
writer, and the best artist. The honour is denied to the right man.
Party is successful against principle. The Pharisee, with his aggressive,
vigorous, narrow-minded nature, with his hard thin character,
all angles and stings, with his starch inflexible opinions upon
religion, politics, science, literature, and art, with his broad assurance
that <i>his</i> ways are the only right ways, rules with a rod of iron the
large herd of humanity, headed by Messrs. Feeblemind and Ready-to-halt.
We find in our national life, when the Battle of the Creeds,
or rather of 'Non-Credo' <i>versus</i> 'Credo,' has been offered and
accepted; when every railway station is hung with texts and strewed
with tracts for the benefit of that British-public-cherished idol the
working-class; when the South Kensington Museum offers professional
instruction in science and art for women before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
become mothers, suggesting that creation by law may be as reasonable
as creation by miracle; when Secularism draws the sword against
Denominationalism; briefly, when those who 'believe' and those
who do not, can hardly keep hands off one another in a <i>mêlée</i>, it
suggests a foretaste of the mystical Armageddon."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard and Charley Drake sketched and fixed the positions of
some fifty ruins which are fated to disappear from the face of the
earth. They took squeezes of from twenty to twenty-five Greek
inscriptions, of which six or seven have dates, and explored the
Harrah, or 'Hot-Country,' the pure white blank in the best maps,
and took hydrographic charts, as they found that the guide-books
and the maps teemed with mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I thought," he said, "when I came here that Syria and Palestine
would be so worn out that my occupation as an explorer was clean
gone, but I soon found that although certain lines had been well
trodden, that scarcely ever a traveller, and <i>no tourists</i>, have ever
ridden ten miles off the usual ways. No one knows how many
patches of unvisited and unvisitable country lie within a couple of
days' ride of great cities and towns, such as Aleppo and Damascus,
Hums, and Hamáh.</p>

<p>"Where the maps show a virgin white patch in the heart of Jaydur,
the classical Ituræa, students suppose that the land has been
examined, and has been found to contain nothing of interest. The
reverse is absolutely the case. Finally, as will presently appear,
there are valid reasons for that same, for the unexplored spots are
either too difficult or too dangerous for the multitude to undertake.
To visit carefully <i>even</i> the <i>beaten</i> tracks in the Holy Land
occupies six months, and none <i>except a resident</i> can afford leisure
or secure health for more, and the reason that these places have
escaped European inspection is, that they do not afford provisions,
or forage, or water; they are deadly with malarious fever, they are
infested by the Bedawi. They do not often detain you for ransom,
nor mutilate you; but they will spear you. They will not kill you
in cold blood; that is only done for a <i>Thar</i>, which is the blood-feud
between tribes. Still, under these mitigated circumstances,
travellers may know that their escorts will turn tail, and will hardly
care to expose themselves, their attendants, and baggage to a charge
of Bedawin cavalry. Indeed, the running away of the escort is the
traveller's safeguard. If the tribe could seize all, it knows that dead
men are dumb, but it knows that the fugitives have recognized
them, and that before evening the tale will be known through all
the land.</p>

<p>"There is no reverence in this ancient place for antiquity. Syria
would <i>willingly</i> change from ancient and Oriental to modern and
European. The ruins of the 'Aláh are pulled to pieces to build houses
for Hamáh. The classical buildings of Saccæa are torn down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
made into rude hovels for the Druzes, who fled from the Anti-Libanus
and Hermon. Syria, north of Palestine, is an old country,
geographically and technologically and other ways, but it is absolutely
new. A land of the past, it has a future as promising as that of
Mexico or the Argentine Republic. The first railway that spans it
will restore the poor old lethargic region to rich and vigorous life.
'Lazare, veni foras!'&mdash;it will raise this Lazarus of Eastern provinces,
this Niobe of nations, from a neglected grave. <i>There is literally no
limit that can be laid down to the mother-wit, the ambition, the
intellectual capabilities of its sons. They are the most gifted race
that I have as yet ever seen, and when the curse shall have left the
country&mdash;not the bane of superstition, but the bane and plague-spot
of bad rule&mdash;it will again rise to a position not unworthy of the days
when it gave to the world a poetry and a system of religion still unforgotten
by our highest civilization.</i></p>

<p>"My object was to become acquainted with the Haurán and its
Druzes, to see the Umm-Nírán Cave, called the 'fire cave,' of which
one hears such extraordinary legends, and the Tulúl el Safá, which is
the volcanic region, east of the Damascus swamps.</p>

<p>"The South Pacific Coast, and Mediterranean Palestine, are two
pendants in the world, only the East is on a much smaller scale.
The lakes and rivers, plains and valleys, cities and settlements, storms
and earthquakes, in fact, all the geographical, physical, and the
meteorological, as well as the social features of the two regions, show
a remarkable general likeness with a difference of proportion.</p>

<p>"The world is weary of the past. In these regions there is hardly
a mile without a ruin, hardly a ruin that is not interesting, and in
some places, mile after mile and square mile after square mile of ruin
show a luxuriance of ruin. There is not a large ruin in the country
which does not prove, upon examination, to be the composition of
ruins more ancient still. The mere surface of the antiquarian mine
has only been scratched; it will be long years before the country
can be considered explored, before even Jerusalem can be called
'recovered,' and the task must be undertaken by Societies, not by
<i>individuals</i>.</p>

<p>"Of history, of picturesque legend, of theology and mythology, of
art and literature, as of archaeology, of palæography, of palæogeography,
of numismatology, and all the other 'ologies and 'ographies,
they have absolutely no visible end. If the New World be bald and
tame, the Syrian old world is, to those <i>who know it well</i>, perhaps a
little too fiery and exciting, paling with its fierce tints and angry
flush the fair vision which a country has a right to contemplate in
the days to be. There is a disease here called 'Holy Land on the
Brain,' which makes patients babble of hanging gardens and parterres
of flowers. The 'green sickness' attacks tourists from Europe
and North America, especially where the sun is scarce. It attacks
the Protestant with greater violence than the Catholic (the Catholic
from long meditation is prepared for it). The Protestant fit is excited
and emotional, spasmodic and hysterical, ending in a long rhapsody
about himself, his childhood, and his mother. It spares the Levantine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
as 'yellow Jack' does the negro. His brain is too well packed
with the wretched intrigues and petty interest of material life to have
any room for excitement at 'the first glimpse of Emmanuel's Land.'
The sufferer will perhaps hire a house at Siloam, and pass his evenings
in howling from the roof, at the torpid little town of Jebus,
'Woe! woe to thee, Jerusalem!' Men fall to shaking hands with
one another, and exchange congratulations for the all-sufficient reason
that the view before them 'embraces the plain of Esdraelon.'</p>

<p>"<i>A long and happy life should be still before it. The ruined heaps
show us what has been; the appliances of civilization, provided with
railways and tramways, will offer the happiest blending of the ancient
and the modern worlds. It will become another Egypt, with the
advantages of a superior climate, and far nobler races of men.</i> Time
was when I dreamt of the Libanus as my future <i>pied à terre</i>. When
weary with warfare and wander, one could repose in peace and comfortable
ease. I thought of pitching a tent for life on Mount
Lebanon, whose <i>raki</i> and tobacco are of the best, whose <i>Vino d'oro</i>
is <i>compared</i> with the best, whose winter climate is like an English
summer, whose views are lovely, a place at the same time near and
far from society&mdash;it was <i>riant</i> in the extreme;<a name="FNanchor_4_163" id="FNanchor_4_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_163" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but in the state of
Syria in <i>my</i> time, the physical mountain had no shade, the moral
mountain no privacy, the village life would have been dreary and
monotonous, broken only by a storm, an earthquake, a murder, a
massacre. Such is the rule of the <i>Wali</i> in this unfortunate time,
when drought and famine, despotism and misrule, maddens its unfortunate
inhabitants.</p>

<p>"We now determined the forms and bearings of the Cedar Block,
the true apex of the Libanus. We then went to the unknown and
dangerous region called Tulúl el Safá, the Hillocks of the Safá
district, a mass of volcanic cones lying east of the Damascus swamps
called lakes. Then we explored the northern Anti-Libanus, a
region which is innocent of tourists and traveller, and appears
a blank of mountains upon the best maps. Of my fellow-traveller
Charley Drake I can only say that every one knows his public
worth. At the end of my time here came three tedious months of
battling unsupported, against all that falsehood and treachery could
devise; the presence of this true-hearted Englishman, staunch to the
backbone, inflexible in the cause of right, and equally disdainful of
threats and promises, was our greatest comfort: I can only speak
of him with enthusiasm. Our journey to the northern slopes of
Lebanon, and the 'Aláh or the highland of Syria, is an absolute
gain to geography, as the road lay through a region marked on
our maps 'Great Syrian Desert,' and the basaltic remains in the
extensive and once populous plain lying north-east and south-east
of Hamah have been visited, sketched, and portrayed for the first
time. We found lignite, true coal, bituminous schists and limestone,
the finest bitumen or asphalt, mineral springs of all sorts, and
ores of all kinds, and plants and rhubarb. And then the duty of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
Consular officer in Syria is to scour the country, and see matters
with his own eyes, and personally to investigate the cases which are
brought before him at head-quarters, where everything except the
truth appears.</p>

<p>"After our visit to Ba'albak and the northern Libanus, we 'did' the
southern parts of the mountain, the home of the Druzes as opposed
to that of the Maronites; then we ascended Hermon, then we had
our gallop to the Waters of Merom, that hideous expanse of fetid
mire and putrefying papyrus. We paid a visit to the only Bedawin
Amir in this region, the Amir Hasan el Fa'úr of the Benú Fadl
tribe, and then we visited most of the romantic and hospitable
Druze villages which cling to the southern and eastern folds of
Hermon."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Home_in_the_Anti-Lebanon"></a>Our Home in the Anti-Lebanon.</i></div>

<p>We used to spend all the summers in the Anti-Lebanon. Bludán
is a little Christian village, Greek orthodox, which clings to the
Eastern flank of the mountain overlooking the Zebedáni valley,
which is well known to travellers, because it leads from Damascus
to Ba'albak. In it we found the <i>official</i> sources of the Barada,
the river of Damascus, but its <i>real</i> source is a pool just behind
our quarters, fed in winter by the torrent of Jebel el Shakíf.
The Bludán block is a few miles north of the site of Abila, the
highest summit of Anti-Lebanon, and is fronted on the west by
Jebel el Shakíf, or "Mountain of Cliffs," with gaps and gorges.
Bludán lies twenty-seven miles to the north-west across country, away
from Damascus.</p>

<p>Ours was a large claret-case-shaped house of stone; the centre
was a large barn-like limestone hall with a deep covered verandah;
a wild waste of garden extends all round the house, a bare ridge
of mountain behind; a beautiful stream with two small waterfalls
rushes through the garden. It is five thousand feet high&mdash;an
eagle's nest, commanding an unrivalled view. The air was perfect,
only hot at three p.m. for an hour or two, and blankets at night.
There was stabling for eight horses; no windows, only wooden
shutters to close at night. We see five or six ranges of mountains,
one backing the other, of which the last looks down upon
the Haurán. We can see Jebel Sannin, which does not measure
nine thousand feet above sea-level, monarch of the Lebanon, and on
the left, Hermon, king of the Anti-Lebanon. The Greek villages
cling like wasps' nests to our mountain, and Zebedáni, on the plain
beneath, contains thirty-five thousand Mohammedans.</p>

<p class="capt">THE BURTONS' HOUSE AT BLUDÁN, IN ANTI-LEBANON.
<i>By Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Day"></a>Our Day.</i></div>

<p>The utter solitude, the wildness of the life, the absence of
<i>luxe</i>, and no society, the being thoroughly alone with Nature and
one's own thoughts, was all too refreshing; we led half-Eastern lives
and half-farmhouse life. We made our own bread, we bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
butter and milk from the Bedawi, we bought sheep or kids from
passing flocks. We woke at dawn, and after a cup of tea, we
used to take the dogs, and have long walks over the mountains with
our guns.</p>

<p>The game were bears (very scarce), gazelles, wolves, wild boars,
and a small leopard called <i>nimr</i>, but for these we had to go far, and
watch in silence before dawn. But Richard had opinions about sport;
he only wanted to kill a beast that would kill us if we did not
kill it, and the smaller game, partridges, quails, woodcocks, hares,
and wild duck, we never shot unless we were hungry, and we would
not have the gazelles hunted. He had the greatest contempt for the
Hurlingham matches, and the battue slaughters in English parks,
where, instead of honestly walking for your game, and bringing it
home to eat, the young men of to-day have a gentle stroll to eat
<i>pâté de foie gras</i>, drink champagne, and the keeper hands them a
gun with a pheasant almost tied to the end of it to blow to pieces.
And what Richard thought about sport I heartily agreed with.
The hot part of the day was spent in reading, writing, and
studying Arabic. He sent home from Bludán, during 1870,
"Vikram and the Vampire" (Hindú tales), "Paraguay," and "Proverbia
Communia Syriaca" (Royal Asiatic Society, 1871)&mdash;three
works he had been long preparing.</p>

<p>His three literary necessities were Shakespeare, the Bible, and
Euclid, and they were bound up together, with three large clasps,
like a breviary, and went everywhere. <i>His</i> method of language-learning
he has described in his autobiography. He taught me this
way. He made me learn ten new words a day by heart. "When
a native speaks, then say the words after him to get his accent.
Don't be English&mdash;that is, shy or self-conscious&mdash;if you know five
words, air them wherever you can; next day you will know ten, and
so on till you can speak. Don't be like the Irishman who would
not go into the water until he could swim. Then take a very easy
childish book, in the colloquial language of the day, and translate it
word for word underneath the original, and you will be surprised
how soon you find yourself unconsciously talking."</p>

<p>At twelve we had our first meal; in the afternoon native Shaykhs,
or English from Beyrout or Damascus, came to visit us, or rare tourists
would crawl up to see what sort of people we were, and how we lived.
They all used to say, "Well, it is glorious, but the thing is to get here."
We set up a <i>tir</i> (shooting-place) in the garden, and used to practise
pistol or rifle shooting, or fence, or put on the <i>cavesson</i>, and lunge
the horses if they had had no exercise. When the sun became cooler,
all the poor within sixteen miles round would come to be doctored;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
the hungry, the thirsty, the ragged, the sick and sorry, filled our
garden, and Richard used to settle grievances, and they all got money
or clothing, food or medicine, and sympathy. Before dinner we
used to assemble in the garden to eat a few mouthfuls of <i>leban</i>
salad and drink a liqueur glass of <i>raki</i>, which was quite necessary
to give us sufficient appetite. Divans were then spread on the
housetop, and we used to watch the moon lighting up Hermon,
whilst we smoked the after-dinner <i>narghíleh</i>. The horses were
picketed out all these summer nights, and the <i>saises</i> slept with them.
The last thing was to have night prayers, and then to go the rounds
to see that everything was right, turn out the dogs on guard, and
then to bed.</p>

<p>The mails came once a fortnight, and Richard would ride
into Damascus and see that all was well. Sometimes we used
to give a picnic to some of our Moslem neighbours, and we
would gallop out in the plain, and stay in the black tents of the
Arabs. I used to have to ride down to the Moslem village Zebedáni
every Sunday for church. The path was steep, and covered with
rolling stones, so that the horses used mostly to slide down, and it
occupied about an hour and a half. The most curious part was
that the Shaykhs and chief Moslems always accompanied me to
Mass. The thing that astonished the Shaykhs the most, was the
small acolytes being able to read and sing in Latin, and they
constantly exclaimed, "Máshálláh!"</p>

<p>We were much grieved about this time to hear the sad news of
poor Lord Clarendon's death. Few amongst us that have not some
happy recollection of that kind, true heart. He belonged to a
breed of gentlemen that with one or two exceptions may be said
to have died out. R.I.P. At this juncture Mr. E. H. Palmer and
Charley Drake had come back from Sinai and the Tih Desert, and
came to stay with us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="With_Drake_and_Palmer_in_the_Lebanon"></a>With Drake and Palmer in the Lebanon.</i></div>

<p>We wandered about for a long time together. On a long day we
might easily zigzag forty or fifty miles, and thirty or thirty-six on
a short day. We never rode straight to a place, and always rode
two horses, as there is so much to be seen on both sides of a
direct way.</p>

<p>Ba'albak is far more beautiful, though much smaller than Tadmor,
and can be seen without any danger. Tadmor is more romantic,
picturesque, more startling, and there is the attraction of the danger,
and being in the absolute desert. Londoners and Parisians would
consider Ba'albak in the desert, but we from Damascus do not.
This was the holy place of the old Phœnicians, and I do not know a
finer sight, from a distant height, when Ba'albak is lit up by the setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
sun. The fertile plain of the Buká'a, with its black Turcoman tents
and camels, lies in the distance. There is a big stone still lying there,
which would weigh eleven thousand tons. The Hajar el Hablah, or
pregnant stone, is a huge unfinished block. Our measurements were
seventy feet long, fourteen feet two inches high, and thirteen feet
eleven inches broad. The extraordinary sight makes you exclaim,
"Something must have frightened them before they had time to
carry it off."</p>

<p>Riding about, you come to the Turcomans' tents, who have
wandered about Syria since the days of the Crusaders, and have
preserved, like their neighbours the <i>Nuwar</i> (gypsies), their ancestral
language and customs. We then went to live for a short while with
the Maronites, two hundred thousand people, under the rule of their
Patriarch, and we camped for some time under the cedars of Lebanon.
There are only nine of these large and ancient trees left; the four
largest are in the form of a cross, and three smaller. There are
555 trees (newer than these nine), all told, and they are 7368 feet
above sea-level. While stopping with his "Beatitude the Maronite
Primate of Antioch, and of all the East," whom his flock calls "our
Patriarch, our Pope, and our Sultan," we saw for once the simplicity
and sincerity of the Apostolic ages.</p>

<p>B'sherri, Jezzín, and Sadád produce a manly, independent race of
Christians, fond of horses and arms, with whom I am not ashamed
to own community of faith. In all my life I have never seen worse
riding than the Kasrawán; it consists of nothing but <i>débris</i> of rock,
fields, valleys, and mountains, all of the largest jagged stones. Our
horses had to do the work of goats, and jump from one bit of rock
to another, and it lasted over twelve hours at once. We lost our camp,
but after seeing our exhausted horses groomed, fed, watered, and
tethered in a warm spot, we were glad to eat a water-melon, and
sleep on our saddle-cloths in the open. The next day was just as
bad until we reached Affka, but the scenery was glorious. We had
three days of this awful riding, which the Syrians call "Darb
el Jehannum," the "road of hell." We visited Mr. Palgrave's old
quarters, a monastery of fifty or sixty Jesuits, where Mr. Palgrave
was a Jesuit for seventeen years. Here we all got fever.</p>

<p>Upon the 26th of August, Richard received at night, by a mounted
messenger, the two following letters from Mr. Wright, Chief Missionary
at Damascus (No. 2), and from Mr. Nasif Meshaka, Chief
Dragoman of the British Consulate (No. 1). I give them as they
were written:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>

<h4>No. 1.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>"The Christians in Damascus are in great alarm; most of
them have left for Saídnayah, and others are about to leave for elsewhere.
Their alarm was occasioned from the following facts: signs
of crosses were made in the streets in the same way which preceded
the massacre of 1860. On the 23rd instant a certain Mohammed
Rashíd, a Government inspector (<i>teftish</i>), being in disguise, caught
a young Jew, twelve years old, in the service of Solomon Donemberg,
a British-protected subject, making signs of crosses in a cabinet of
a mosque at Suk el Jedíd. Yesterday another young Jew, in the
service of Marco, a French Jew, was caught also. Both of these
two boys were taken to the Government; being under age, they
were at once released by order of Mejlis Tamiz Hukúk. It is
believed that the Moslems are the authors of these signs, either
directly or indirectly, to stop the Government from taking the Redíf
(militia), which is managed in a very oppressive manner, that is,
leaving many families without males to support them. Such kinds
of Redíf prefer rather to be hanged than seeing their harims without
support or any one to maintain them in their absence. A certain
Nicolas Ghartous, a Protestant from Ain Shára, reported to me
yesterday that while waiting on Mr. Anhouri, near the barracks of
the Christian quarter, being dressed like a Druze, three soldiers of
the same barracks came to him and said, 'Yakík el 'ijl,' a technical
term used by the Druzes, meaning, 'Are you ready for another
outbreak?' Ghartous replied, 'We are at your disposal.' The
soldiers replied, 'Prepare yourself, and we will reap our enemies
from here to the Báb Sharki' (the Christian quarter), and thus they
departed. Hatem Ghanem, a Catholic member in the Haurán,
came here to recover some money due to him by Atta Zello of the
Meydán Aghas. While claiming the money he was beaten, and his
religion and Cross were cursed by his debtor, who was put in prison
at the request of the Catholic Patriarchate. Twenty to thirty Redífs
of the Meydán ran away to the Lejá'a, to take refuge there. The
Redífs will be collected next Saturday, the 27th instant, some say
at the Castle of Damascus, others at Khabboon and Mezzeh. The
report is current that on that day there will be no work in town, and
that there will be an outbreak. Although Ibraham Pasha, the new
Governor, arrived on the 23rd instant, he will not undertake his
duties till the return of the <i>Wali</i>. The Governor, as well as some
Frenchmen, through M. Roustan, who is now at Jerusalem, intend
to propose to the <i>Wali</i> to leave Holo Pasha to continue occupying
his present function under the present circumstances. The <i>Mushir</i>
left on the 19th instant. The <i>Wali</i> is absent. The <i>Muffetish</i>,
whom you know his inefficiency, is the Acting Governor-General.
Consuls are absent (that is, the French and English). The presence
of the high functionaries, and especially the Consuls, is a great
comfort to the Christians in general."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>


<h4>No. 2.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have just got in from Rasheiya, and before I sat down
several Christians and one Moslem came in to ask if I knew what
was coming. They seemed to be very much afraid; but, except
that people don't act logically, I see no reason for fear. The fear,
however, <i>does</i> seem <i>very</i> great. I know nothing. Any English of
us here should be ready at the worst to fight our corner. Many
thanks for your prompt action in our affairs. It is something to
have</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'One firm, strong man in a blatant land,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who can act and who dare not lie.'<br /></span>
</p>

<p>"W. W."</p></blockquote>

<p>It appeared that one of those eruptions of ill-feeling, which are
periodically an epidemic in Damascus, resulting from so many
religions, tongues, and races, was about to simmer into full boil
between Moslem and Christian. The outsiders are fond of stirring
up both, for they reap all the benefit. It appeared that a slaughter-day
was fixed for the 27th of August, 1870; all the Chief Authorities,
by an accidental combination of affairs, were absent as well as the
Consuls. Wednesday is the Moslem's unlucky day, and also, I
believe, the 23rd; it is thought it will be the day of the end of the
world. There would be nobody to interfere, and nobody to be
made responsible. It was the night of the 26th when he got these
letters. Richard ordered the horses to be saddled, the weapons to
be cleaned. In ten minutes he told me what his plans and arrangements
were. He said, "We have never before been in a Damascus
riot, but if it takes place it will be like the famous affair of 1860.
I shall not take you into Damascus, because <i>I</i> intend to protect
Damascus, and you must protect Bludán and Zebedáni. I shall
take half the men, and I shall leave you half. You shall go down
into the plain with me to-night, and we shall shake hands like two
brothers and part; tears or any display of affection will tell the secret
to our men."</p>

<p>So it was done, and at six o'clock the next morning he walked into
the <i>mejlis</i> (council chamber). He was on good terms with them all,
so he told them frankly what was going on, and said, "Which of
you is to be hanged if this is not prevented? It will cost you Syria,
and unless you take measures at once, I shall telegraph to Constantinople."
This had the desired effect. "What," they asked, "would
you have us to do?" He said, "I want you to post a guard of
soldiers in every street; order a patrol all night. I will go the rounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
with Holo Pasha. Let the soldiers be harangued in the barracks,
and told that on the slightest sign of mutiny the offenders will be
sent to the Danube (their Cayenne). Issue an order that no Jew or
Christian shall leave the house till all is quiet." All these measures
were taken by ten o'clock a.m., and continued for three days. Not
a drop of blood was shed, and the frightened Christians who had
fled to the mountains began to come back. There is no doubt that
my husband saved Damascus from a very unpleasant episode. Mr. L.
Wright, Mr. Scott, and the other missionaries, his own dragomans, and
a few staunch souls who remained quietly with him, appreciated his
conduct, and he received many thanks from those on the spot. The
diligence was so much in request (nearly all the Christians and
Europeans had tried to leave) that a friend of mine could not get
a seat for three weeks; yet these people, so soon as they sighted the
Mediterranean, were brave and blatant. "Oh! <i>we</i> were not at all
frightened; there was <i>no</i> danger whatever!" Mr. Eldridge, who
had lived for ten years safely on the coast, and had never ventured
up to Damascus in his life, a civilian whose dislike to the smell of
powder was notorious, wrote me a pleasantly chaffing letter, hoping
I had recovered my fever and fright, and giving Richard instructions
how to behave in time of danger. When Richard had gone I climbed
back to our eyrie, which commanded the country, and collected
every available weapon and all the ammunition. The house was
square, looking every way. I put a certain number of men on each
side with a gun each, a revolver, and bowie-knife. I put two on
the roof with a pair of elephant guns carrying four-ounce balls, and
took the terrace myself. I planted the Union Jack on the flag-staff
at the top of the house, turned our bull-terriers into the garden,
locked up a little Syrian maid, Khamoor (the Moon), who was very
pretty (Richard used to say her eyes were of the owlified largeness of
the book of beauty), in the safest room, and my English maid, who was
as brave as a man, was to supply us with provisions. I knew that
I could rely upon our own men, so I filled all the empty soda-water
bottles full of gunpowder, and laid fusees ready to stick in and light,
and throw amongst the crowd. I then rode down to the American
mission&mdash;the only other people near&mdash;to tell them if there was the
slightest movement to come up and shelter with me; and then into
the village of Bludán, to tell the Christians there to come and camp in
our garden; and lastly to Zebedáni, where there were a few Christians
living amongst the thirty-five thousand Moslems, and I sent them up at
once, because there would be no time for <i>them</i> to reach me if danger
came suddenly. The others were close by. I then rode down to the
Moslem Shaykhs, and asked them what <i>they</i> thought. They told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
there <i>would</i> be a fight. "One half of our village will fight <i>with</i> you
and yours, the other half will destroy the Christians here and at
Bludán. They will hesitate to attack <i>your</i> house, but if matters are
so bad as that, they shall pass over our dead bodies, and those of
all our house, before they reach <i>you</i>." And every night they came up
and picketed round the garden till my husband came back.</p>

<p>This lasted three days, and all subsided without accident. At this
time also there was a tremendous row between a Moslem and a
Christian woman; he tore the woman's ear down, smashed her black
and blue, bruised her, and took all her gold ornaments from her. The
case of Hassan Beg, on whose account my husband was reported, by
the British Syrian School missionaries, to be recalled <i>on account
of my conduct</i>, happened a whole year before my husband's recall.
After this, when we rode desert-wards, the tribes used in the evening
to dance especially for Richard. The men formed a squad like
soldiers; they plant the right foot in time to tom-tom music, with
a heavy tread, and an exclamation like that used by our street-menders
when the crowbar comes down with a thud upon the
stones. When they are numerous it sounds like the advance of an
army, and they would burst out into song, of which the literal translation
would be&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Holo_Pasher_gives_us_a_Panther"></a>Holo Pasher gives us a Panther.</i></div>

<p>We were very fond of animals, and especially of wild ones.
Holo Pasha had given us a panther cub trapped in the desert to
show his appreciation of what Richard had done. We brought him
up like a cat. He grew to be a splendid beast, and never did any of
us harm, but he frightened the other animals a little sometimes.
We kept him very well fed, in order that he might never attack them.
Our cat was very frightened of him, and the only animals that he was
frightened of were the bull-dogs. He used to sleep by our bedside.
He had bold bad black eyes, that seemed to say, "Be afraid of me."
He used to hunt me round the garden, playing hide-and-seek with
me as a cat does a mouse. When he bit too hard, I used to box
his ears, when he was instantly good. But he grew up and was
large. There was a certain baker that the bull-terriers used to bite,
and the panther, who also saw in him what we did not, worried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
him. At last the peasantry, who were frightened of him, gave him
poison in meat. He withered away, and nothing we could do did
him any good, and one day, when I went to look round the stables,
he put his paw up to me. I sat down on the ground, and took him
in my arms like a child. He put his head on my shoulder, and his
paws round my waist, and he died in about half an hour. Richard
and I were terribly grieved.</p>

<p>There are charming rides across the Anti-Lebanon through a mountain
defile to Ain el Bardi, where we found black tents and flocks
feeding by the water. There is very much to be seen in the plain of
El Buká'a, beginning at Mejdel. Anjar is a little village on a hillock
standing alone; on its top is a small gem of a temple built by Herod
Agrippa in honour of Augustus, with a very graceful broken column;
below it are the ruins of Herod's Palace, and a twenty minutes'
further ride in the plain lie the ruins of Chalcis. From the temple
above named we could see the greater part of the Buká'a, walled
in at either side by the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon, and dotted
with seventy-two villages. Anjar is bisected by the Litani river,
falsely called the Leontes. Having feasted our eyes, we rode on to
the square ruins of Chalcis in the plain, and to Neby Za'úr to see
the tomb, and we carried off skulls and bones. We crossed the
plain, ascended the Lebanon, and when near its summit turned to
our left across a mountain called Jebel Barúk, in the territory of El
Akkúb.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Druzes_Their_Stronghold"></a>The Druzes&mdash;Their Stronghold.</i></div>

<p>A favourite ride was into the Druze country, beginning at Barúk,
a stronghold in a wild glen. They are a fine, tall, strong, and manly
race, who can ride and fight and shoot, and are fit to be our allies.
There is no cant about them; they are honest and plain-spoken, and
do not know intriguing, lying, stealing, or spying. A Druze house has
huge black rafters in the ceiling, and straight tall columns down the
middle; there is a private room for council. The women have one
blue garment, and one white veil showing one eye. They are chaste,
and good wives and mothers. They have clean, comfortable homes,
and give a warm welcome, and we rested here for some time. People
often say, "What is the real religion of the Druzes?" No one ever
knew who was not a Druze; they conform to the national religion,
the Moslem. In speaking to you or me, they would appear to have
a particular leaning to our respective faiths. They have a secret
creed of their own, which, although women are admitted to the
council chamber, is as mysterious as Freemasonry. Some Moslems
pretend that they worship Eblis, and some Christians say the bull-calf
El Ijl.</p>

<p>On our road we came to another stronghold, like an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
convent, where lives Melhem Beg Ahmad, a Druze chief, a dare-devil-fine-old-man,
who, when he mounts, takes his bridle in his
teeth, puts his musket to his shoulder, and charges down a mountain
that an English horse would have to be led down. He lives in great
style; he threw his cap in the air, drank to our health a thousand
times, and his sons waited on us at dinner. Muktára hangs on a
declivity in a splendid ravine in wild mountains in the territory of
Esh Shuf. The house we were going to is like a large Italian
<i>cascine</i>, nestled amidst olive groves, that are, so to speak, the
plumage of the heights. It is the Syrian palace of the Jumblatts,
the focus and centre of the Lebanon Druzes. Here reside this
princely family, headed then by a Chieftainess, the "Sitt Jumblatt."</p>

<p>Long before we sighted Muktára, wild horsemen, in the rich Druze
dress, came careering down, jeriding on beautiful horses, with guns
and lances, the sons and retainers of the house heading them. They
were splendidly mounted, and one of the sons had a black mare, so
simply perfect I infringed the tenth commandment. We descended
into a deep defile, and rose up again on the opposite side, the whole
of which was lined with horsemen and footmen to salute us, and
the women trilled out their joy-cry. Ascending the other side was
literally like going up stairs cut in the rock; it was a regular fastness.
We rode our horses up the flight of stairs into the court. We received
the most cordial and gracious hospitality from the <i>Sitt</i>, who
had all the well-bred ease of a European <i>grande dame</i>. Water and
scented soap was brought in carved brass ewers and basins to wash
our hands, incense was waved before us, we were sprinkled with rose-water,
whilst an embroidered gold canopy was held over us. Coffee,
sherbet, and sweets were served. The next morning the palace was
filled with grey-bearded and turbaned scribes, with their long brass
inkstands, and the <i>Sitt</i> explained to Richard that her affairs were
entirely neglected at Beyrout, and asked him to do something for
her. He explained that it was a great embarrassment to him, as he
was subordinate to Mr. Eldridge, but that, whatever she chose to
write, he would make a point of going himself to present her wishes
to Mr. Eldridge. Richard notes in his journal that day among
others, "Eldridge does nothing, and is very proud of what he does.
Consular office awfully careless; sick of dyspepsia; nothing to do
body and mind."</p>

<p>We sat down to a midday meal equivalent to a dinner, and
then went to the <i>Jeríd</i> ground, where the sons and their fighting
men displayed their grace and skill. The stables are solid, and
like tunnels with light let in, containing sixty horses, all showing
blood, and some quite thoroughbred. At nightfall there was a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
dinner, to which all the retainers flocked in; there was dancing and
war-songs between the Druzes of the Lebanon and the Druzes of the
Haurán, ranged on either side of the banqueting hall; they performed
a pantomime, they sang, and recited tales of love and war far into
the night.</p>

<p>An amusing thing was, that after the <i>Sitt</i> had dined with us, I
found her shortly after sitting cross-legged on the floor of the kitchen,
devouring a second dinner. I said, "Ya Sitti, I thought you had
eaten your dinner with us; what are you doing?" She laughed,
and said, "My dear child, you don't suppose for an instant that I
got a bit into my mouth with those knives and forks; I was only
doing pantomime for the honour of the house. Now I am getting my
<i>real</i> dinner with my fingers!" We were accompanied out with the
same honours as those with which we were ushered in. How sorry we
were to leave! Our friendship always lasted. We used to begin, "My
dearest sister," and she used to say all those sweet things which only
Easterns can say, such as&mdash;"My eyes sought for you many days till
my head ached; when will you come to repose them, that I may not
see your empty place?"</p>

<p>We went on to Deir el Khammar to the palace of Bayt el Din
(B'teddin), where Franco Pasha (the best governor the Lebanon has
ever known) lived, and was restoring this ruined castle of the late
terrible Amir Beshir Sheháb, from whence the view is splendid. He
had about five hundred soldiers, and was doing enormous good. He
had a band, a school, was planting pine trees and wheat, teaching
carpet-making, tailoring, shoemaking, making roads, teaching religion
and loyalty to God, to the Sultan, with liberality and civilization. He
produced an electric shock upon us by the invisible band playing
"God save the Queen." We sprang to our feet, and in that wild
place it made me cry. In this region we met the only real <i>prince</i> in
Syria, the Emir Mulhem Rustam. We had an immense quantity of
deputations of Druze Shaykhs; those of the Haurán were something
like bears, with huge white turbans, green coat, massive swords,
some in red, and all exceedingly wild-looking. We then went to
Ali Beg of Jumblatt, at Baderhan. We passed innumerable Druze
villages, until we came to Jezzín, one of the three manly Christian
villages. Usuf Beg, their Chief, was a delightful Shaykh.</p>

<p>Sometimes these breakfasts on the march were very amusing, where
there were a mixture of races and religion. You would see forty
intrigues round a dish of rice. At Rasheya there was no water; here
we were on Druze ground again. From this we went to the top
of Mount Hermon, <i>i.e.</i> it has three tops, and we put a <i>kakú</i> of stones
on the highest for a remembrance. The view is immense. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
found a cave and saw a hare. When we got to the bottom, there
was hardly a shoe or a rag left amongst us. Here we met some very
charming Druze chiefs, and went with them to Hasbeya, because
Richard was convinced that the sources of the Jordan were not as
they are given in books; and he was perfectly right. There is a
slanting rock with some figs growing out of it, and oleanders growing
in luxurious clumps in the sand all around, and out of this rock
rushes a stream, which we traced to the Jordan. Near is a mine of
bitumen.</p>

<p>From thence to Kefayr, another Druze village, after which we
rode to Banias. Of course, there are loads of things to see all
the way&mdash;caves or temples, or what not; but, then, all those can
be got in books. The sources are supposed to be here, at Banias,
and are made much of; and all visitors go to the fountain of
Jordan, the cave of Pan, the temple of Herod and Augustus,
with the three niches. The water trickles from beneath under
the stones, separating into eight or nine streams, but they are
not the real source.</p>

<p>We had a large escort to-day. Ali Beg Ahmadi and his cavalry,
Shaykh Ahmad, and many others, came to escort us, and we had
a delicious gallop over the plain of Ghyam, which is part of the Ard
el Húleh, through which runs the Jordan, and another portion of
the same is called the Abbs. We came to Arab tents, and drank
milk with the Bedawi; we found many of them down with fever,
and stopped to doctor them with Warburg's drops. We had to ride
all day, and at last through marshy, rushy places under a burning
sun, without a breath of air.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_camp_at_the_Waters_of_Merom"></a>We camp at the Waters of Merom.</i></div>

<p>This valley of the Jordan, if drained and planted, would be
immensely rich, but it teemed now with luxurious rankness, fever,
and death. We pitched our tents under a large tree, divided from
the lake by papyrus swamps; a most unwholesome spot, where we
were punished by every sort of insect and crawling thing in creation;
and we all got headache and sore throat at once.</p>

<p>The Bahret el Huleh, or the Waters of Merom in Josh. xi. 5-7,
anciently called Lake Semachonitis, is a small blue triangular lake,
the first and highest of the three basins of the Jordan. We had all
our escort with us; we had scarcely any food; there was none for
the horses. We had to turn them all loose to forage for themselves,
except the stallions, and they had to be led. It was a hideous
expanse of fœtid mire and putrefying papyrus. We had a frightful
night, a stifling heat, a very blizzard of wind, rain, thunder, and
lightning, and we were camped under the only tree in the plain.
It was black dark; the ground was bad-smelling black mud; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
passed the dark hours in holding our tent-pole against the wind, and
digging trenches outside to let the water off. There were no dry
clothes to be had, and the various vermin would not let one rest.
We were like that for three days; so we piled up the trunks and
sat at the top of them, and read "Lothair," by Disraeli, which
we had brought with us. The description of the great houses of
England read so funnily sitting in this black mud in the centre of
desolation, surrounded by feverish swamps.</p>

<p>In spite of the difficulties of moving in such weather, Richard
and I were agreed that if we stayed there any longer, we should
all perhaps get in such a state as not to be able to move at all;
so we saddled our horses, and ordering our followers and escort
to strike tents, pack, load, and follow, we mounted and waded our
horses through the water, scrambled over stones and slippery rocks,
and in and out mud and slush for two hours, often sinking deep, till
we reached the mountain roots and began to ascend.</p>

<p>After some hours' climbing we arrived at the seventy-two tents of
the Shaykh Hadi Abd Allah; he instantly gave us hospitality, barley
for our horses and food for ourselves. They were all yellow and sickly,
and, even at this height, dying like sheep of fever from the miasma
arising out of the plain that we had been in for three days. They
had lost many children, and double sorrow when sons. One boy was
dying as we entered. Our tents came up to us late that day with
all our belongings. Our animals and people were fed. We stayed
with the tribe long enough to doctor them all round, and to leave
remedies and directions; and I baptized the incurables and the
dying children.</p>

<p>Then came down the Amir Hasan el Fá'ur of the Benú Fadl,
or Fazli tribe. He heard of our being in the neighbourhood,
and took us off to his camp on the summit of a mountain called
Jebel Haush, a day's ride away, where we found his three hundred
tents. The whole tribe turned out to meet us, mounted and
couching their lances, and jeríded the whole way back. The reception
tent was fifty feet long, and each divan was twenty-five feet
long. The retainers cleared a space for our camp, corn was
brought, horses picketed; an excellent dinner on a large scale in
the big tent was cooked, lambs and kids roasted whole, stuffed with
pistachios and rice, bowls of <i>leban</i>, unleavened bread, honey, and
camels'-milk butter, bowls of clear sparkling water. I love to think
now of those dark, fierce men, in their gaudy flowing costumes,
lying about in different attitudes, the moon lighting up the scene;
the lurid glare of the fire on their faces, the divans and pipes,
<i>narghílehs</i> and coffee, their wild and mournful songs, their war-dances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
their story-telling; and on that particular night, and on all
these sort of nights, my husband would recite to them one or another
tale out of the "Arabian Nights"&mdash;those tales which he has now
translated literally for the London world; and I have seen the
gravest and most reverend Shaykhs rolling on the ground and screaming
with delight, in spite of their Oriental gravity, and they seemed
as if they could never let my husband go again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_is_stung_by_a_Scorpion"></a>Richard is stung by a Scorpion.</i></div>

<p>I can remember that night, when he and I went to our tent and
lay down on our respective rugs, he called me over, for he was
stung by a scorpion, but when I struck a match there was nothing
but a speck of blood, as though from a black ant; so we lay down
again, and he called out, "Quick, quick! I <i>know</i> it is a scorpion."
I ran over and struck another light, and plunged my hand into the
shirt by the throat, and the scorpion caught my finger. I drew it out
and shook it off, and killed it; but it did not sting me, being, I
supposed, exhausted. I rubbed some strong smelling-salts into the
wounds, and, seeing he was pale, ran off to the provision-basket and
got a bottle of <i>raki</i>, and made him drink it, to keep the poison
from the heart, and he woke in the morning quite well.</p>

<p>I now discovered that though they were treating us with this
splendid hospitality, that behind the scenes they were also dying
in their tents of fever, although they were in the purest air; so here
we again stayed to doctor, and nurse, and baptize, and leave directions
and remedies.</p>

<p>We then went on to most of the romantic and hospitable Druze
villages which cling to the southern and eastern folds of Hermon&mdash;Mejdel
Esh Shems to Birket er Ram, or Lake Phiala,<a name="FNanchor_5_164" id="FNanchor_5_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_164" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a little round
lake which we found interesting enough to come back to afterwards.
Mejdel is on a declivity of a mountain defile&mdash;their favourite position&mdash;a
Druze stronghold, very fighting and turbulent, where we were
received and treated like relations. Then we got to Beyt-Jenn, where
we had a mixed Druze and Christian place. We came in for a very
interesting Druze wedding at Arneh, at the foot of Hermon, just
above which rise the sources of the Awaj, which waters El Kunayterah.
We then went to a Druze village called Rimeh, to look for
a stone with an inscription, which we found in a stable, and then
to the Bukkásim, which is the Druze frontier. Here our Druze
cavalcade took an affecting leave of us. As we rode away I could
see them for three-quarters of an hour standing on a high rock to
watch us out of sight, one or two of them with their faces buried
in their mares' necks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Wuld Ali.</span></h4>


<p>Our escort of free-lances one day, as we were riding to some of
our usual environs, soon perceived that we were making for the
desert, towards the direction where the dreaded Mohammed Dúkhi
was known to camp, and they began the well-known dodges of
making their horses curvet and prance and wheel in circles as if they
had become unmanageable, and every round became so much larger
that they gradually dropped out of sight. Presently some cast a
shoe, or another had broken a girth, and stopped to rectify it. The
fact is, Richard had been determined to make friends with the Wuld
Ali tribe, of which Mohammed Dúkhi is the Chief, and rules five
thousand lances. At last we found ourselves alone, so we rode on
all that day, slept by our horses at night in a ruined <i>khan</i>, and got in
sight of the Wuld Ali encampment late next day. Richard said to
me, "Now mind, when they see us two horsemen, they will come
galloping across the sand in a body with their lances couched; if
we were to turn and run, they would spear us; but if we sit our
horses, facing them like statues on parade, just as the Life Guards
sit in their sentry-boxes at the Horse Guards at home, they will take
us in with great applause, and our horses will stand it, because they
are used to desert manners."</p>

<p>I said "All right," as I always did when he gave me an order,
and I was glad he put me up to it, for, sure enough, when they saw
our two dusky figures galloping from a distance across the sand
towards them, the whole tribe charged with their lances couched,
and we reined in and stood stock still, facing the charge; but as
soon as they got within a few yards, they seemed by instinct to
recognize the man they were charging. They lowered their lances,
opened their ranks to enclose us, and with one cry of "Ak-hu
Sebbah!" (Brother of the Lion), jumped off their horses, kissed our
hands, galloped in with us jeriding, and held our stirrups to alight.
I need not say that we were treated with all the true hospitality
of real Bedawi life, and we remained several days with them. My
husband's object was to make peace between the Wuld Ali and the
Mezrabs. We visited the lakes which are near them, and they were
all dried up except a bit of water in the sand about the size of a
small duck-pond. "What, then," said Richard, "becomes of the
Bárada and the Awaj, the so-called ancient Abana and Pharphar?"
They have been partly drawn off, and partly evaporated before
reaching their basements at 'Utaybah and Hijánah, where we then
were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<p>The Arabic of Damascus, <i>especially</i> the Christian Arabic, Richard
found so grating to the ears after the pure speech of the Bedawi&mdash;and
that of the Nejd and El Hejaz.</p>

<p>Richard writes an account of a trip&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Explorations_of_Unknown_Tracts"></a>Explorations of Unknown Tracts.</i></div>

<p>"A little later on Charley Drake and I again started to revisit the
Tulúl el Safá,<a name="FNanchor_6_165" id="FNanchor_6_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_165" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and our first eight days was over the old ground.
This trip added considerably to our scanty geographical knowledge
of these regions off the tracks. In one week we collected some
hundred and twenty inscriptions, and three lengthy copies of Greek
hexameters and pentameters from the Burj, a mortuary tower at
Shakkah, a ruin long since identified as the Saccæa of Ptolemy.
We went to the top of Tell Shayhán, whose height is 3750 feet,
which showed us that the Lejá, the Argob of the Hebrews and
the western Trachon of the Greeks and Romans, is the gift of
Tell Shayhán.<a name="FNanchor_7_166" id="FNanchor_7_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_166" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is a lava bed, a stone torrent poured out by
the lateral crater over the ruddy yellow clay and the limestone
floor of the Haurán valley, high raised by the ruins of repeated
eruptions, broken up by the action of blow-holes, and cracked and
crevassed by contraction when cooling, by earthquakes, and the
weathering of ages. 'The features are remarkable. It is composed
of black basalt, which must have issued from the pores of the earth
in a liquid state, and flowed out until the plain was almost covered.
Before cooling its surface was agitated by some powerful agency, and
it was afterwards shattered and rent by internal convulsions and
vibrations' (Porter). Two whole days were spent at Kanawát, the
ancient Canatha, a city of Og.</p>

<p>"There are now hundreds of Druzes, and we may remark for the
first time 'the beauty of Bashan,' the well-wooded and watered
country. We then went along the Jebel Kulayb and visited the
noble remains of Sí'a, where we met with three Palmyrene inscriptions,
showing that the Palmyra of Ptolemy extended to the
south-west far beyond the limits assigned to it. We then got
to Sahwat el Balát, where lives my influential friend, Shaykh Ali
el Hináwí, a Druze Akkál of the highest rank; and here they
gathered to meet me and palaver. We crossed the immense rough
and rugged lava beds which gloom the land. Jebel el Kulayb was
bright with vetch, red poppy, yellow poppy, mistletoe with ruddy
berries, hawthorn boughs, and the vivid green of the maple and the
sumach, the dark foliage of the ilex oak scrub, and the wild white
honeysuckle. There was cultivation; the busy Druze peasantry at
work, the women in white and blue. The aneroid showed 5785 feet,
the hygrometer stood at 0°, the air was colder than on the heights
of Hermon in June, and the western horizon was obscured by the
thickest of wool packs. Here we made two important observations.
The apparently confused scatter of volcanic cratered hill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
hillock fell into an organized trend of 356° to 176°, or nearly north-south.
The same will be noticed in the Safá, and in its out-layers
the Tulúl el Safá, which lie hard upon a meridian; thus the third or
easternmost great range, separating the Mediterranean from the
Euphrates desert, does not run parallel with its neighbours, the
Anti-Libanus and Libanus, which are disposed, roughly speaking,
north-east 38°, and south-west 218°.</p>

<p>"The second point of importance is that El Kulayb is not the apex
of the Jebel Durúz Haurán, though it appears to be so. To the
east appeared a broken range, whose several heights, beginning from
the north, were named to us. Tell Ijaynah, bearing 38°, back by the
Umm Haurán hill, bearing 94°; the Tell of Akriba (Wetz Stein),
bearing 112° 30'; Tell Ruban, bearing 119°; and Tell Jafnah,
bearing 127° 30'. We believed that Tell Ijaynah was 6080 English
feet high, and we thought that Jebel Durúz must be greatly changed
since it was described by travellers and tourists.</p>

<p>"Here the land, until the last hundred and fifty years, was wholly
in the hands of the Bedawi, especially of the Wuld Ali, and the nine
hill tribes already named. At last the Druzes, whom poverty and
oppression drove away from their original home, the Wady Taym
and the slopes of Libanus and Hermon, settled here. In Rashíd
Pasha's reign seventeen mountain villages have been repeopled, and
in 1886 some eight hundred families fled to this safe retreat; nor can
we wonder at the exodus, because of half the settlements of the Jaydur
district, the ancient Ituræa, eleven out of twenty-four have been
within twelve months ruined by the usurer and the tax-gatherer, and
at one time a hundred and twenty Druze families went in one
flight from their native mountains to the Haurán.</p>

<p>"They found here a cool, healthy, but harsh climate, a sufficiency
of water, ready-made houses, ruins of cut stone, land awaiting cultivation,
pasture for their flocks and herds, and, above all things, a
rude independence under the patriarchal rule of their own chiefs. In
short, the only peaceful, prosperous districts of Syria are those where
home rule exists, and there is scarcely any interference by the
authorities. It is a short-sighted and miserable management which
drives an industrious peasantry from its hearths and homes to
distant settlements where defence is more easy than offence.</p>

<p>"This system keeps the population of the whole province to a
million and a half, which in the days of Strabo and Josephus
supported its ten millions and more. The European politician is
not sorry to see the brave and sturdy Druze thrown out as a line
of forts to keep the Arab wolf from the doors of the Damascene,
but the antiquary sighs for the statues and architectural ornaments
broken up, the inscribed stones used for building rude domiciles,
the most valuable remnants of antiquity white-washed as lintels,
or plastered over in the unclean interiors. The next generation
of travellers will see no more 'mansions of Bashan.'</p>

<p>"At Shakkah (Saccæa) there are still extensive ruins and
fine specimens of Hauránic architecture, especially the house of
Shaykh Hasan Brahím with its coped windows and its sunken court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
Here we were received by the Druze Chief, Kabalán el Kala'áni, who
behaved very badly to us, and when we tried to go, refused to let us
unless we paid him forty napoleons for ten horsemen. We laughed
in his face, told him to stop us if he dared, and sent for our horses.
However, as we were going into a fighting country, I sent back all
the people who would have been in the way.</p>

<p>"The Druzes had been quarrelling amongst themselves; fifteen
men had been killed, and many wounded. We had to doctor three;
one had a shoulder-blade pierced clean through. We were joined
<i>nolens volens</i> by ten free-lances, and escorted as far as Bir Kasam,
their particular boundary. Finally, it appears that our visit to the
'Aláh district, lying east of Hamáh, has brought to light the existence
of an architecture which, though identical with that of the Haurán,
cannot in any way be connected with that of Og. Although only
separated by seventy miles from the southern basaltic region, the
northern has also its true Bashan architecture, its cyclopean walls,
its private houses, low, massive, and simple in style, with stone roofs
and doors, and huge gates, conspicuous for simplicity, massiveness,
and rude strength. Moab has the same, only limestone is used
instead of basalt.</p>

<p>"Dumá Ruzaymah is occupied by three great houses, and the
Junaynah hamlet is the last inhabited village of this side towards
the desert. We now got to the Wady Jahjah, thence to El Harrah,
'the Hot or Burnt Land,' and to the Krá'a, which we crossed in
fifty-five minutes, and got into or entered the Naká, <i>and were
surprised to see a messenger mounted on a dromedary, going at a great
pace, and evidently shunning us</i>. We had descended 3780 feet; the
passage occupied two hours.</p>

<p>"We then ascended into the Hazir, and from the top we had our
first fair view of the Safá,<a name="FNanchor_8_167" id="FNanchor_8_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_167" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a volcanic block, with its seven main
summits. They stood conspicuously out of the Harrah, or 'Hot
Country.' In the far distance glittered the sunlit horizon of the
Euphrates Desert, a mysterious tract, never yet crossed by European
foot. We eventually arrived at the stony, black Wa'ar, a distorted
and devilish land, and we then got to a waterless part, where our
horses were already thirsty, and into the Ghadir, where we had been
promised water, and it was bone dry. After long riding, we came
to a ruined village, El Hubbayríyyah, where we found yellow water
forming a green slime. It was again the <i>kattas</i> which led me to the
water, as in Somali-land. Here we spent an enjoyable fifty minutes
at the water, refreshing ourselves and beasts; it lies 3290 feet above
sea-level. We presently fell into the Saut on return; it was good
travelling, and we saw old footmarks of sheep, goats, and shod
horses.</p>

<p>"The only sign, as we turned out of the Saut and swept down from
the Lohf, that human foot had ever trod this inhospitable wild, was
here and there a goat-fold, with a place for the shepherd on a commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
spot, or more probably a Bedawin sentinel or scout (you
often see a solitary tribesman perched on a hilltop). The road was
simply a goat-track, over the domes of cast-iron ovens, in endless
succession. It was a truly maniac ride. <i>At the Rajm el Shalshal
we again saw traces of our friend on the dromedary.</i> That day at
4.20 p.m. we were surprised by our advanced party springing
suddenly from the mares, and hearing the welcome words, 'Umm
Nirán!' (the mother of fire). Late as it was, we rejoiced, because a
night march over such a country would have been awful. The cave
is as dry as the land of Scinde, and in the summer sunshine the
hand could not rest upon the heated surface, but after rain there is
a drainage from the fronting basin into the cave. We crawled into
it and entered a second tunnel, and after two hundred feet we came
to the water, a ditch-like channel, four feet wide. The line then bent
to the right from north-north-east to the north-east. Here, by plunging
our heads below water and raising them further on, we found an oval-shaped
chamber, still traversed by the water. We could not, however,
reach the end, as shortly the rock ceiling and the water met. The
supply was sweet, the atmosphere close and damp, the roof an arid
fiery waste of blackest lava. The basalt ceiling of the cave sweated
and dripped, which could not have been caused only by simple
evaporation. The water began by a few inches till it reached mid-thigh.
The length was a total of three hundred and forty feet; the
altitude was 2745 feet.</p>

<p>"A water scorpion was the only living thing in the cave.
This curious tunnel reservoir is evidently natural. There are
legends about a clansman going in with black hair, and coming
out after the third day with white hair, and one of our lads declared
he had taken an hour to reach the water; but we, on all fours,
took three minutes. We set out again next day for the great
red cinder-heap, known as Umm el Ma'azah, where we halted for
observation, and then fell into the trodden way which leads from the
Ghutah section of the Damascus plain to the Rubbah valley.</p>

<p>"We had long and weary desert rides, seeing everything to the
Bir Kasam. Bedawi never commit the imprudence of lingering
near the well after they have watered their beasts, because that is
the way to draw a <i>ghazú</i>, or raid, down upon you.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_prevent_Rashid_Pashas_Intentions_taking_effect"></a>I prevent Rashíd Pasha's Intentions taking effect.</i></div>

<p>"Now I have every reason to be thankful that I did not bring my
wife on this journey, as she was not very well. In this country fever
and dysentery seize upon you with short notice, and pass away again,
and she, though in no danger, was not in a state for hard riding at the
time. At Bir Kásam, a Druze greybeard, on a <i>rahwán</i>, rode up to the
well, and took the opportunity of making me a sign: pretending to
question him, as to the name of a mountain on the horizon, I led
him away, and he cautiously pulled out of his pocket a medicine
bottle, which he handed to me, from my wife. I then knew there
was something up, and I thanked him, giving him some money, and
asked him if he had anything to say. He said, 'If I may advise
you, get rid of all your party. They want to go to Damascus or
Dhumayr; announce that you are going to neither, and they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
probably forsake you, as this is not a safe spot. I shall ride on, till
out of sight, and then turn round and ride back to Damascus,
by slow degrees, sleeping and eating on the road. You and your
friend ride into Jebel Dákwah; but first read the directions about
the medicine.'</p>

<p>"I uncorked the bottle, saw my wife's warning in writing,
and carefully put them in my pocket not to leave a 'spoor.' I
then paid him still more handsomely, and told him to go back to
my wife, and tell her it was 'all right,' and not to fear. As evening
fell, they asked us what our intentions were. We said we were not
going either to Damascus or Dhumayr, and, as our messenger had
prophesied, they all disappeared in the night, to our great relief.
As soon as the last man had disappeared, we went into the
Dákwah Mountain (hid our horses in a cave), from the cone of which
you command a view of the whole country, and after a few hours
we saw a hundred horsemen and two hundred dromedary riders
beating the country, looking for some one in the plains. At last
they turned in another direction, towards some distant villages, and
when we were consoled by not seeing a living thing, we descended
from our perch, galloped twenty miles to Dhumayr, where we were well
received by faithful Druzes, whose Chief was Rashíd el Bóstají. We
were just in time. The Governor-General had mustered his bravos;
they missed us at Umm Nirán, at the Bir Kasam, and again upon
the <i>direct</i> road to Dhumayr, having been put out by our <i>détour</i> to
Dákwah. They were just a few hours too late everywhere; so, to
revenge themselves, they plundered, in the sight of six hundred
Turkish soldiers, the village of Suwáydah, belonging to my dragoman
Azar, whose life they threatened, and also Abbadáh and Haraán el
Awáníd. So we rode into Damascus, escaping by peculiar good
fortune a hundred horsemen and two hundred dromedary riders,
sent on purpose to murder <i>me</i>. I was never more flattered in my
life, than to think that it would take three hundred men to kill <i>me</i>.
The felon act, however, failed."</p></blockquote>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rashíd Pasha's Intrigue with the Druzes&mdash;My Account from
Damascus.</span></h4>

<p class="center">"I wish each man's forehead were a magic lantern of his inner self."<br />
<br /></p>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Rashids_Intrigue_about_the_Druzes"></a>Rashíd's Intrigue about the Druzes.</i></div>

<p>About this time the Druzes wrote and asked Richard to come to
the Haurán. He wished to copy Greek inscriptions and explore
volcanoes. He was not aware that the <i>Wali</i> had a political move
in the Haurán, which he did not wish him to see. Mr. Eldridge
knew it, and encouraged him to go, as his leave would be short.
Richard knew that if he went to one man's house, he must go to
everybody, therefore he asked them all to meet him at the house of the
principal Shaykh. When the <i>Wali</i> was told by Richard that he was
going, his face fell, but he suddenly changed, and said, "Go soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
or there will be no water." Mr. Eldridge, who never left Beyrout,
and had at that time never seen Damascus, had talked a great deal
about going there; so Richard wrote and asked him to go with him,
but to that there was no answer. It was providential that I was
weak with fever and dysentery, and could not ride, so that I was left
at home. As soon as he was gone the <i>Wali</i> wrote to me, and
accused my husband "of having made a political meeting with the
Druze Chiefs in the Haurán, thereby doing great harm to the
Turkish Government." Knowing that Richard had done nothing of
the kind, I told him so, but I saw there was a new intrigue on. The
<i>Wali</i> had only let my husband go in order to be able to accuse him
of meddling, and by Mr. Eldridge's not answering I suspected he
knew it too. An old Druze from the Haurán came to our house,
said he had seen my husband, and began to praise him. I said,
"Why, what is he doing?" He replied, "Máshálláh! we never saw a
Consul like him. He can do in one day what the <i>Wali-Pasha</i> could
not do in five years. We had a quarrel with the Bedawi, and we
carried off all their goats and sheep, and the Government was going
to attack us. Our Chiefs, when they saw the Consul (Allah be
praised!), told him the difficulty, and asked him what we ought to do.
He told us we ought to give back the goats and sheep to the Bedawi,
and to make up our quarrel, and submit to the Government, for
that the war will do us great harm. The Shaykhs have consented,
and now we shall be at peace. Máshálláh! there is nobody like
him!" I now began to wonder if the <i>Wali</i> had intended a little
campaign against the Druzes, and if my husband had spoilt it by
counselling submission. If he had intended to reduce the Druzes
of the Eastern Mountains, and if a campaign took place in Jebel
Durúz Haurán, the inhabitants would have been joined by the
fighting men of the Lebanon, Anti-Lebanon, and Hermon. The
country is eminently fitted for defence, and the Druzes, though
badly armed, are brave, and animated by the memories of past
victories. In short, the same disgraceful defeat of the Turkish
Government would have taken place as that which occurred in 1874,
and which caused the <i>Wali</i>, Mustafa Beg, and nine high officials to
be dismissed.</p>

<p>The <i>Wali</i> then employed somebody&mdash;who I need not name&mdash;to
inform him what day my husband was coming back. On being
questioned about it, my suspicions were aroused; I immediately gave
the wrong date (it was God's own blessing that I had for once been
unable to go with him). I got the faithful old Druze to start at once,
with a pretended bottle of medicine. I wrote, in a cipher that my
husband and I composed and understood together, the whole history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
of the case, and I tied it round the cork of the bottle, covering it with
leather and a bit of oil-skin, and sent my messenger straight out to
meet him. It was just in time. He noticed with his keen desert
instincts the fresh spoor of one solitary dromedary; the rider was
bound like them from Shakkah to the north-east (where the Bedawi
encamped), not for exploration, but with a message. He divined the
ill-omened foot-prints which he saw twice in different localities, and
so soon as the medicine bottle reached him, with what Ouida would
call "a quiet low laugh under his moustache," he altered his course,
and from a concealed shelter in the rocks was able to watch the progress
of a hundred horsemen and two hundred <i>Redifs</i>&mdash;dromedary
riders, two in each saddle&mdash;beating the country and looking for some
one. Now, these were not <i>real</i> Bedawi, but the jackals who call themselves
Bedawi, who surround the Cities, and are to be hired like bravos
for any dirty work. They went off on a false scent, and he arrived
home all right. Now, the day of his arrival I had been obliged, more
or less officially, to attend a ceremony, where the <i>Wali</i> and Authorities
and the Consuls would be present with their wives. I was determined
to go, and to put on a perfectly calm exterior, though I felt
very heart-sick, and a well-known Greek in the <i>Wali's</i> pay said to
me, with a meaning, unpleasant smile, "I fancy there will be
important news for you in a short while." I felt very faint inside,
but I said coolly, "Oh, will there? Well, I suppose I shall get it
when it comes." Almost immediately afterwards, Richard's Afghan
walked in, and saluting said, "The Consul has returned and wants
you." The faces of the <i>Wali</i> and his Greek were a study. I saluted
them all, went out, jumped on my horse, and rode back. Had the
<i>Redifs</i> fallen in with Richard, the verdict would have been, "Fallen
a prey to his wild and wandering habits in the desert." The <i>Wali</i>
then forged a letter from Richard to the Druzes, and forwarded it
through Mr. Eldridge to the Foreign Office. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>Richard and I and Charley Drake made another pleasant journey
exploring the Anti-Libanus. Everybody thinks, even professional
geographers, if you speak of the Anti-Libanus, that you are going
over trodden ground, filling up details upon the broad outlines
traced by other people; but it is very far from being the case. Now
the best maps only show a long conventional caterpillar, flanked by
acidulated drops, and seamed with a cobweb of drainage. They
never name a valley north-east of Zebedáni, nor a summit, except
Jebel el Halímah, which is not its name. The northern half of the
Anti-Lebanon is arid and barren, the southern is very fertile, and it
is far superior to the Lebanon. Weird, savage, like parts of Moab,
the colouring is richer, forms more picturesque, contrasts of shape
and hue are sharper, and the growth is more like thin forest.
"That ravines of singular wildness and grandeur furrow the whole
mountain side, looking in many places like huge rents," is true of
Anti-Lebanon, but not of Lebanon. The views are superior; it is
richer and more remarkable.</p>

<p>Some of our followers will not forget some of our day's work, for
we ascend successively every height, taking angles, laying down
altitudes, and building up <i>kakús</i> to serve for a theodolite survey.
Charley Drake mapped and sketched whilst we wrote.</p>

<p>The Convent of Nabi Baruh is ruinous in the extreme, but it gave
us the idea of being the most ancient which we had seen throughout
Syria and Palestine. The reception in these wild places is always
the same, if they are not Christians, who&mdash;why, it is impossible to
say&mdash;generally receive one badly, except of course the Maronites
in their stronghold, and more especially the splendid Christians of
Jezzín, Sadád, and B'sherri, who are marked exceptions to the
generality of Christians, and who are equal, if not better than
the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Manner_in_which_we_are_received_in_Villages"></a>The Manner in which we are received in Villages.</i></div>

<p>All the Chiefs and notables meet the stranger at a distance beyond
the houses. As the two parties meet, he reins in his horse and touches
hands, snatching away his with a jerk if they attempt to kiss it,
reproachfully ejaculating "Astaghfir 'Ullah!" (I beg pardon of Allah,
<i>i.e.</i> God forbid that such a thing should happen). If you permit it
they kiss your hand, and ridicule you in their minds as a fool, who
delights in such homage as a priest, whose right it is. Guided by
the Shaykhs, each in a strict precedence as at a London dinner-party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
he rides leisurely, not hastening the pace, lest he cause his host to
run; he dismounts at the door, and the Chiefs and notables rush to
hold his horse, his stirrup, and his back under the shoulders. He
must be sure to ride into the courtyard, no matter how broken be
the gate threshold, nor how slippery the pavement, or up the steps, or
they will suspect him of not knowing how to ride. He is led to the
<i>salamlik</i>, but he will not enter till the women who have been sprinkling
the floor have made themselves scarce. He sits down, doubling his
legs a little if he cannot cross them, whilst the others form a semicircle
upon humbler rugs before him. Each salaams, and is salaamed
to, as he takes his place, squatting ceremoniously on his shins, till
his visitor says, "Khuz ráhatak" (Take your ease), suggesting a more
pleasant posture. If he fails to do this they will watch an opportunity
to change seat, but if disposed to be impertinent they will
stretch out their shanks and require a reproof. Water pipes, sherbet,
lemonade, and coffee are brought, after which the Shaykh will retire
and beg you to repose.</p>

<p>A breakfast is served about noon of cheese, soured milk, grape
syrup, raw green onions, boiled rice, wheaten scones, and eggs
fried in clarified butter. It is vulgar for the stranger to produce
his own wine and cold meat from the saddle-bags. At sunset meat
is served. A whole kid is a prime sign of honour. During
meals one of the family stands up, holding a metal pot full of drinking
water. Pipes and coffee conclude. The correct thing is to
compel the Shaykh and the Chiefs to eat with you; the followers
and retainers will eat afterwards, the trays being removed to another
part. At night there will be a <i>samrah</i>, or palaver, in which the
state of the country in general, and the village in particular, is
discussed, grievances are quoted, the usurer and creditor complained
of, the Government and Governor abused. Local legends are
told, and the traveller can gain any amount of information if he can
speak the language. They press him to stay next day, and his
excuses are received with a respectful and regretful unwillingness.</p>

<p>Before leaving next morning he will find out privately what he has
cost them, he will find out that his animals have been well fed, and
he will manage to slip it and something more into the hands of one
of the women or children. Before the departure the women of the
family will offer excuses for their poor fare, saying, "La tawák-hizná"
(Don't be offended with us), and he will hasten with many
"Astaghfir 'Ullahs" to express his supreme satisfaction. He mounts
as ceremoniously as he dismounted, preceded by his escort, but
every now and then he reins in, dismissing them&mdash;"Arja'ú ya
Masháikh" (Return, O Shaykhs). They persist in walking to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
last house, and often much farther; they again try to kiss his hand,
which he pulls away as before, and the visit ends. The visited then
retire and debate what has caused the visit, and what will be the
best way to utilize it.</p>

<p>We divided and visited every section of the northernmost line of
Anti-Libanus from the Halímat el Kabú, 8257 feet above sea-level.
We enjoyed an extensive and picturesque view far superior to anything
seen in the Libanus, especially southwards. From here we
might write a chapter on what we could see. The weather being clear,
we could even see the long-balled chine of the Cedar Block of the
Libanus, and its large spots of snow, which glowed like amethysts
in evening light. We could see the apex of the Libanus, which
falls into the Jurd of Tripoli. We could see the Jebel el Huleh,
which defines the haunts of the mysterious Nusayri; the glance
falls upon the Orontes Lake, upon the rich cultivation of Hums and
Hamáh, one of the gardens of Syria upon the ridge of Salámiyyah,
that outpost of ancient Tadmor, and upon the unknown Steppe el
Huleh, and the Bedawi-haunted tracts which sweep up to the
Jebel el Abyaz, whilst the castle of Aleppo bounds the septentrional
horizon. The end of this day was a remarkable one. "It was the
only occasion," said Richard, "during my travels in Syria and Palestine
that I felt thoroughly tired. My <i>rahwán</i>, though a Kurd nag,
trembled with weakness, and my wife jogged along sobbing in her
saddle, and if it had not been for the advice of Charley Drake we
should have spent the night on the mountain-side; but we did arrive.
Habíb had built a glowing fire, beds were spread, tea was brewed,
and presently a whole roast kid appeared, and restored us all in the
best of humours; and our horses, after plenty to eat and drink, and
being well rubbed down, lay down. We had had fifteen hours very
hard work, not counting the before and after the march."</p>

<p>We next determined to prospect the third part of the east-west
section of Anti-Libanus, including the Ba'albak crest, and then to ride
up the Cœle-Syrian valley so as to fill in the bearings of the western
wady mouths. We had forage for our beasts, water the whole way,
and we were excited by the account of inscriptions and ruins. The
Wady el Biyáras was splendid in scenery, and though our road was
horrible, we congratulated each other in not missing it, and we
descended into the Wady Atnayn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Remarks_on_the_Journey"></a>Remarks on the Journey.</i></div>

<p>It is very curious to observe the goats and sheep; they don't mix
much, though in the same flock. The goats prefer difficult and
venturesome places, the sheep browse in the lower lands. The goat
is curious and impudent&mdash;he goes out of the way to stare and sneeze
at you; the sheep is staid and respectable, like the "good young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
man." Here Richard did nothing but quote a piece of poetry which
amused him intensely&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"In Teneriffe, for a time brief,</span><br />

</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Kurdish_Dogs"></a>Kurdish Dogs.</i></div>

<p>Some of the goatherds are rather bullying. The Kurdish dog is
shaggy, with cropped ears, large head, brindle coat, rough hair, bushy
tail, as big as a St. Bernard, and looks like a bear; but if he is a
soldier's dog, he is always civil. I took one from a Bedawi tent as
a pup; he was christened "Kasrawán," which soon became "Cuss."
From his earliest puppyhood he played watchman, and led our
horses by the halter. As he grew up he would hardly allow a native
to pass along the road at night. He wrangled with and made love
to our English bull-terriers, he appeared to be sorely oppressed with
the seriousness of life, and could never get fighting enough. A
Fellah threw him some meat with a needle in it, a favourite style of
revenge of one who has been once bitten, and does not care to be
bitten again; we were obliged to put him out of his misery, and he
was honourably buried in the garden of Bludán.</p>

<p>We carried out all our prospected journey, gathering information,
inscriptions, and ruins everywhere, till we reached Yabrud, where
the Shaykhs gave us a picnic, to show us the Arz el Jauzah.</p>

<p>There is a temple known as Kasr Namrúd; the water flows through
a conduit of masonry, and is said to pass into a large underground
cistern below, round the ample stone troughs and scattered fragments
of columns. All through Syria Nimrod represents the Devil,
and 'Antar the Julius Cæsar of Western Europe. The picnic, under
the shade of this venerable building, passed off happily enough.
The <i>kabábs</i> of kid, secured instantly after sudden death, were
excellent; the sour milk and the goat's cheese were perfection; and
the Zahlah wine had only one fault&mdash;there was only half a bottle,
and we could have drank a demijohn. We were very much struck
by the similarity of plan which connects the heathen temple with
the Christian church. It was late in the afternoon when we shook
hands with our good host. It is pleasant to think upon happy
partings&mdash;we never saw them again.</p>

<p>On our way home we passed ruins, arched caves, and sarcophagi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
whilst a wall displays a large rude crucifix. We were received later
at Talfíta with all honours by the Shaykh el Balad Mahfúz, whose
pauper homes had been destroyed and the rest threatened by the
villainous usurers under British protection, and next day we rode into
Damascus. During this excursion, we had seen in a range of mountains,
supposed to be impracticable, four temples, of which three had
been hitherto unvisited; we had prepared for the map of Syria the
names of five great mountains; we had traced out the principal
gorges, all before absolutely unknown to geography; we had determined
the disputed altitudes of the Anti-Libanus, and we proved that
it is much more worthy of inspection than the much-vaunted Libanus.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Another Trip, described by Charley Drake</span>.<a name="FNanchor_10_169" id="FNanchor_10_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_169" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></h4>


<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Excursions_to_Unknown_Tracts"></a>Excursions to Unknown Tracts.</i></div>

<p>"It is curious to see even what discrepancies there are in the heights
of the Lebanon, which have been visited by scientific men. It
shows that it must have been guess-work. There is one height
which the goatherds know by the name of Tizmarún; but the
aneroids, uncorrected for temperature, gave a reading of barely nine
thousand feet, and this is the highest, though not generally acknowledged
so.</p>

<p>"We wonder whether England will ever look upon Syria as anything
else than a land for tourists to amuse themselves in; whether
she will ever see that a <i>pied à terre</i> there, would secure her not only
an uninterrupted passage to India, but wealth incalculable in mineral
and agricultural produce; that both may yet be drawn from this
fertile land, whose soil needs no manure, and whose mountains teem
with ores.</p>

<p>"The prettiest scenery we had seen in the Lebanon was at the head
of a large <i>wady</i>, called El Nakrah; wild deep gorges, overhung by
fantastic rocks, and in some places thickly wooded, are alternated
by open grassy Alps, contrasting well with the deep rich purple of
the basalt, and the yellow sandstone which was never far from it.
When we got to the head of the Wady Mimnah overlooking the
entrance to Hamath, the comparatively level tract that stretches
from Tripoli to Hums, and divides the Lebanon from the Jebel
Nusayri, we got to Akkar, to Kala'at el Husn and to Hums,
crossing the river Orontes. When we were in the 'Aláh, all the
Arabs agreed that it contained three hundred and sixty-five ruins,
and that if a man travelled for a year, he might never sleep twice in
the same village; and we quite believed it. The number of Bedawi
who infest this region, the want of water, the loose basaltic soil, so
tiring to horses, and want of reliable information, is, doubtless, the
reason why this district has never been explored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Pasha of Hamáh worried us with a large escort, which meant
piastres. The troop would have made the fortune of any theatre as a
gang of bandits in a burlesque. There were horses of all sizes and
colours&mdash;some had bridles, some had none&mdash;half-starved beasts, not
able to keep up with ours; pistols that would not go off, swords that
would not come out of the scabbards; but one of them, a short-bodied,
long-legged fellow, was mounted, without stirrups, on a year-old colt,
his only arm a lance sixteen feet long. He looked like a monkey, armed
with a broomstick, riding a small dog. On the road we found several
ruined, deserted, fortified camps. The Circassians are come into
this part of the country, and have taken a village from the Nusayri,
and ousted the rightful owners, and we think there will be mischief
later on. We reached the edge of the plain, in which stands Salamíyyeh,
whose chief, Amir Ismail, is a patriarchal old gentleman.
Holo Pasha sent us a large escort without our asking him; but when
we explained to them our intention of striking across the desert to
Shakún, they declined to go, which delighted us. Going along, we
found the Haddidín Arabs encamped all along the desert.</p>

<p>"It is a curious thing to say, but there are sheep and goats where
there is apparently nothing to eat, yet they are always fat. The soil
is rich, but very tiring to horses, because it gives way beneath their
weight, letting them sink in to the hock. At Shakún we found a
quarantine for travellers from Baghdad. We were now on the
ordinary travelling road from Hamáh to Aleppo. In these deserts
the Haddidín go to the wells, which are a great depth, a hundred to
a hundred and fifty feet. A horse is attached to the end of a
rope, and trots away, bringing the leathern bucket to the surface.
If the well be not very deep, they sometimes harness two women
in it. El Háthir is in a marsh which has been dry for two years,
and abounds in a large and troublesome horse-fly, whose bite is so
severe that the horses were streaming with blood.</p>

<p>"We passed through a salt-pan which becomes a lake in the winter
months, and is a source of considerable revenue to the Government.
Soldiers are placed here to prevent contraband trade in salt.</p>

<p>"The refraction induces mirage. It seems impossible that one is
not looking upon a pellucid and unruffled lake, in which both the
houses of Jabúl and the outlines of an insular Tell are clearly
reflected by the mirage.</p>

<p>"Akrabeh must have been a place of importance from the extent
of ground over which the ruins are spread. The resemblance borne
by the mounds on which the castles are built in Hums, Hamáh, and
Aleppo is very striking; they are quite identical, Aleppo being the
largest. At Hamáh particularly we find monuments of greatest
possible value. History is silent about the construction of these
three sister castles, but we thought that the five blocks of basalt at
Hamáh, covered with hieroglyphics in excellent preservation, may
be the opening page of a new chapter in history."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard took copies and Charley Drake took squeezes of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>At Aleppo, in the south wall of the Jam'ia el Kahan, is a block of
basalt with an inscription similar to those of Hamáh. Though much
defaced, Charley Drake made out nineteen characters identical with
the above-mentioned, and a doorstep bore the same. Charley Drake
thought that the key to these characters must be looked for in <i>beth</i>
(house), <i>kaf</i> (hand), <i>gimel</i> (camel), <i>ain</i> (eye), etc., of the Semitic
alphabet. Hands, flowers, and teeth, and other unmistakable signs
occur. If Richard was right, the well-known Moabite Stone would
be modern in comparison, and we shall see these remarkable monuments
deposited in the Louvre or the St. Petersburg Museum; and,
as Charley Drake said, "there will be the usual gnashing and weeping
of teeth after it is too late." But for my own part, in 1892, I begin
to doubt that England is sufficiently interested in anything, except
money, to have the energy to gnash its teeth at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The ironwork of the gates of the castle of Aleppo is very good.
The upper gate bears the name of Melek el Dhaher and the date
645 A.H. Having been officially informed that the mosques of
Aleppo might not be visited by any Christian, we thought that something
interesting might be found; but we managed to see them, and
we did not find much, and the Shaykhs were only anxious to give
all the information they could. We crossed the Nahr el Kowwáyyik,
which does not run thirty miles to the south of Aleppo, as said in
maps, but loses itself at a distance of two and a half hours from the
City. On our road a row was going on between the Kurdish
shepherds and the Fellahín of this place. The shepherds bring
sheep down from Mesopotamia and Diarbekr by easy stages, and sell
them at Aleppo and Damascus. The Fellahín envy and dislike
these itinerant pastors. We rode seven and a half miles from
Aleppo, arriving at Serákib.</p>

<p>"If you listen, the Fellahín are always talking about money, and
prices, and transactions. The Bedawi only delights in listening to
or telling stories of travelling and adventure, or smokes his pipe in
placid enjoyment, while another of them sings an endless romance
to the stirring tones of a one-stringed fiddle. We rode on to
Mo'arrat el No'aman, where we visited some very interesting ruins
in Jebel el Zowi. We then went to Jirjinnáz, as we found we could
make it a head-quarter, and visit all the ruined cities within reach
and then move on to Temányeh. The natural features and ruins of
the 'Aláh are nearly all alike&mdash;a rolling plateau varying from thirteen
hundred feet at the north-eastern, to sixteen hundred feet at the
south-western above sea-level.</p>

<p>"From Damascus to Aleppo, one only meets with a few favoured
villages whose supply of water is just sufficient to irrigate a
patch of land and a few trees. The first ruin in the 'Aláh was
Abu Mekkeh, and it was exactly like the uninhabited cities of the
Haurán and the Lej. The ruins of Surr 'Aman are a mere collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
of rude shelters piled up with old materials. The ruins of Tarútín
el Tujjar are the most important in the 'Aláh. The village of
Harráken was repeopled by Fellahín four years ago. Happily they
have not the organ of destructiveness, as have their brethren in
Palestine, and what was broken was accidental, and not wilful
damage, like in the Haurán. At Burj el Abiadh ruins of considerable
extent surround the white tower after which it is named. At Kufayr
we found a ruined tower two stories high. The tower and ruins at
El Fárajeh are of the usual type, but more solid. Nearly all the
ruins bear crosses, Greek or Latin. At El Ikhwayn there is good
water, but at Temányeh the villagers have to go a mile distant, to a
hill with a well at the top. We then went to Atshán, passing the
mounds and pillars which mark the site of S'kayk el Rubyíet. We
next visited El Ma'an, which has the largest guard-house in the
'Aláh, built by Justinian. Of the ruins of Duwaylíb little has been
left; the stones have been carried off for building purposes. We
got water for our thirsty horses at the shallow well of Arúneh, beside
which and around were encamped the Bedawi Mowáyleh. We
rode through the ruins of Kefr-Ráa, and then descended into the
valley of Orontes to Hamáh.</p>

<p>"There is a pyramidal-roofed tomb at El Barah. The roofs of these
curious sepulchral monuments are built of massive stones, open
inside up to the apex. One rock-hewn cave contains six loculi, five
and a quarter feet long, by three and a quarter feet deep, and two
and a quarter feet wide, with semicircular arches above them. On
one of the rounded pillars we remarked that two crosses had been
obliterated. A round-about road took us to Kefr Omar, where we
saw a ruined monumental column built with circular stones upon a
square base. We then went to Hass, where there was every kind of
style of tomb&mdash;a square tower supporting a pyramidal roof, and all
kinds of other shapes. The number of ruined villages in this
district is surprising. During the day's ride you could count from six
to eight with not a mile between them. Near Mo'arrat el No'aman
is a castle similar to that near Salamíyyeh. At Danah there are
very extensive ruins, and one building called the 'Church' resembles
that near Hass. The stones used in these buildings are commonly
six feet long, by two wide, and two deep. Here the Shaykh told us
that twenty years ago a tomb had been opened, and a small gold
image, a sword, a dagger, and some glass and pottery vessels had
been found. There were one or two tombs in imitation of rock-hewn
sepulchres. We felt certain that the ruined cities of Jebel el
Zowi would amply repay any one with time and opportunity to make
excavations. We then went to examine the Hums Lake, whose
position, considering the rapid fall of the Orontes Valley, had always
been a puzzle.</p>

<p>"We eventually came to a dam of masonry five hundred yards in
length, and twenty feet high in the centre, built across the northern
end of the lake. A small square tower stands at the west of it, and
the water leaks through it in several places, but the dam looks as if
it would last many centuries. The lake is now four or five feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
lower than in winter, yet the surface of the water is about twelve
feet higher than the river at the base of the dam, and many feet
higher than the housetops of Saddi. Were the barrage ever to give
way the destruction to life and property down the valley of the
Orontes would be terrible. The ruins of Wajh el Haja afforded
little of interest. We passed through many villages till we came to
Tell Nebi Mand, a conspicuous mound. The native Moslems think
that this prophet was related to the patriarch Joseph, but the Shaykh
assured Richard that the tomb was that of Benjamin. The place
marks the site of the ancient Laodicea and Libanum. At the south-east

Ark.' It was probably a Roman post of observation to guard the
entrance of the Buká'a. From Tell Nebi Mand we rode back to
Damascus."</p></blockquote>

<p>Unofficially speaking of official things, we had rather a lively

always say "we," because I enter so much into my husband's pursuits,

<p>The first shadow upon our happy life was in 1870-71. An
amateur missionary, residing at Beyrout, came up to Damascus,
visited the prisons, and distributed tracts to the Mohammedans.
It was the intention of the Governor to collect these prints, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
to make a bonfire of them in the market-place. Damascus was
in a bad temper for such proselytizing. It was an excitable year,
and it was necessary to put a stop to proceedings which, though
well meant, could not fail to endanger the safety of the Christian
population. The tract-distributor was a kind, humane, sincere,
and charitable man, and we were both very sorry that he had to
be cautioned. He had an enthusiasm in his religious views which
made him dangerous outside a Christian town. At Beyrout he
was well known, but at Damascus he was not, and the people
would have resented his standing on bales in the street haranguing
the Turks against Mohammed. I believe this gentleman would
have gloried in martyrdom; but some of us, not so good as he is,
did not aspire to it. His <i>entourage</i>, also, was not so humble or so
kind as himself.</p>

<p>Richard was obliged to give the caution, to do his duty to his
large district, thereby incurring at Beyrout most un-Christian
hatreds, unscrupulously gratified. Richard, with the high, chivalrous
sense of honour which guided all his actions, redoubled his unceasing
endeavours to promote the interest and business of these
persons, amidst the hailstorm of petty spites and insults&mdash;which
justice and greatness of mind on his part they themselves were
obliged <i>eventually</i> to acknowledge, however reluctantly. We were
decidedly destined to stumble upon unfortunate circumstances.
Since that, a gentleman told off to convert the Jews in one of
Richard's jurisdictions, insisted on getting a ladder and a hammer,
and demolishing a large statue of St. Joseph in a public place of
a Catholic country, because he said it was "a graven image." Why
are the English so careless in their choice? and why have other
foreign Consuls no <i>désagrémens</i> on this head?</p>

<p>Richard writes&mdash;</p>


<h4>No. 2.</h4>


<blockquote>

<p>"The Druzes applied early in 1870 for an English school. They
are our allies, and we were on friendly terms with them. As two
missionaries wished to travel amongst them, I gave them the
necessary introductions. They were cordially received and hospitably
entertained by the Shaykhs, but on their road home they were
treacherously followed by two <i>mauvais sujets</i> and attacked; they
were thrown off their horses, their lives were threatened, and their
property was plundered.</p>

<p>"Such a breach of hospitality and violation of good faith required
prompt notice: firstly, to secure safety to future travellers; and,
secondly, to maintain the good feelings which have ever subsisted
between the Druzes and the English. To pass over such an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
of treachery would be courting their contempt. I at once
demanded that the offenders might be punished by the Druze chiefs
themselves, and twenty napoleons, the worth of the stolen goods,
were claimed by me for the missionaries. The Druzes went down
to Beyrout to try to pit Consulate-General against Consulate, and
refused to pay the claim. I then applied for their punishment
to the Turkish authorities, knowing that the Druzes would at once
accede to my first demand&mdash;a proceeding approved of by her
Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. After three months the
Shaykh el Akkál, head religious chief, brought down the offenders,
who were recognized by the missionaries. They confessed their
guilt, and the Shaykh, who was staying as a guest in our house,
assured me [Richard] that I was perfectly right in acting as I had
done, and that every Druze was heartily ashamed of the conduct of
these two men."</p></blockquote>


<h4>No. 3.</h4>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Usurers_very_troublesome"></a>Usurers very troublesome.</i></div>

<p>"In June, 1870, I prepared a despatch for our Ambassador at
Constantinople, on the system of defrauding the poor and of
'running' villages by the Damascus Jewish money-lenders.</p>

<p>"I will now try to explain how these matters stood.</p>

<p>"In former days, when not a few Europeans were open to certain
arrangements which made them take the highest interest in the
business transactions of their clients, a radically bad system, happily
now almost extinct, was introduced into Syria. The European
subject, or <i>protégé</i>, instead of engaging in honest commerce, was
thus encouraged to seek inordinate and usurious profits by sales
of the Government and by loans to the villagers. In such cases
he, of course, relied entirely upon the protection of a foreign Power,
on account of the sums to be expended in feeing native functionaries
before repayment could be expected. Thus the Consuls became,
as it were, <i>huissiers</i>, or bailiffs, whose principal duties were to collect
the bad debts of those who had foreign passports.</p>

<p>"Damascus contained a total of forty-eight adult males protected
by H.B.M.'s Consulate, and of these there were a triumvirate of
Shylocks. Most of them are Jews who were admitted to, or whose
fathers acquired, a foreign nationality, given with the benevolent
object of saving them from Moslem cruelty and oppression in days
gone by. These <i>protégés</i> have extended what was granted for the
preservation of their lives, liberties, and property, to transactions
which rest entirely for success upon British protection. The case
of No. 1, whom we will call Judas, is a fair example. He has few
dealings in the city, the licit field of action. But since the death
of his highly respectable father, in 1854, he had been allowing bills
signed by the ignorant peasantry of the province to accumulate at
simple and compound interest, till the liabilities of the villagers have
become greater than the value of the whole village. A&mdash;&mdash;, for
instance, on the eastern skirt of Mount Hermon, owed him 106,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
piastres, which were originally 42,000. He claims 5000 purses
from the B&mdash;&mdash; family, upon a total debt of 242,000½ piastres, in
1857. We have not yet passed through a single settlement where
his debtors did not complain loudly of his proceedings; and to
A&mdash;- may be added C&mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, and D&mdash;&mdash; el X&mdash;&mdash;, a stronghold
of the Druzes. Some villages have been partly depopulated
by his vexations, and the injury done to the Druzes by thus driving
them from the Anti-Lebanon to the Haurán, may presently be
severely visited upon the Ottoman authorities.</p>

<p>"The British <i>protégé</i> is compelled every year, in his quality of <i>shúbasi</i>
(farmer of revenue), to summon the village Shaykhs and peasantry,
to imprison them, and to leave them lying in jail till he can squeeze
from them as much as possible, and to injure them by quartering
<i>hawali</i>, or policemen, who plunder whatever they can. He long occupied
the whole attention, though it had other and more important
duties, of the Village Commission (<i>Kumision Mahasibat el Kura</i>),
established in A.H. 1280 (1863). For about a year a special commission
(<i>Kumision Makhsus</i>) had at that time, 1870, been sitting
on his case, whose intricacies, complicated by his unwillingness to
settle anything, wearied out all the members. At different times
he quarrelled with every person in the Court&mdash;from the <i>defterdar</i>,
who is its President, to the Consular Dragomans, who composed it.
Even felony was freely imputed to him by various persons. He
was accused of bribing the Government <i>khatibs</i> (secretaries) to
introduce into documents sentences of doubtful import, upon which
he can found claims for increased and exorbitant interest, of adding
lines to receipts and other instruments after they have been signed,
and of using false seals, made at home by his own servants. One
of the latter publicly denounced him, but was, as usual, paid to
keep silence. He is reported again and again to have refused, in
order that the peasants might remain upon his books, the ready
moneys offered to him for the final settlement of village liabilities.
His good management had baffled all efforts at detection, whilst
every one was morally certain that the charges were founded on
fact. He corrupts, or attempts to corrupt, all those with whom he
has dealings.</p>

<p>"I wanted to inform them that British protection extends to preserving
their persons and property from all injustice and violence,
but that it would not assist them to recover debts from the Ottoman
Government, or from the villages of the province, and that it would
not abet them in imprisoning or in distraining the latter. To such
general rule, of course, exceptions would be admissible, at the discretion
of the officer in charge of H.B.M.'s Consulate; in cases, for
instance, when just and honest claims might be rejected, or their
payment unduly delayed. The sole inconvenience which would
arise to such creditors from their altered positions would be the
necessity of feeing the Serai more heavily; and even they openly
communicated with the local authorities, reserving the Consulate
as a forlorn hope. The change might possibly have directed their
attention to a more legitimate commercial career. Such a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
would have been exceedingly popular throughout the country, and
would have relieved us from the suspicion of interested motives&mdash;a
suspicion which must exist where honesty and honour, in an English
understanding of these words, are almost unknown; and from the
odium which attaches to the official instruments of oppression.
Finally, the corruption of Damascus rendered me the more jealous
of the good name of the Consulate, and the more desirous of personal
immunity from certain reports which, at different times, have been
spread about <i>others</i> in office. I therefore posted on the door of
H.M.'s Consulate, Damascus, the following notice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Her Britannic Majesty's Consul hereby warns British subjects
and <i>protégés</i> that he will not assist them to recover debts from the
Government or from the people of Syria, unless the debts are such
as between British subjects could be recovered through H.M.'s Consular
Courts. Before purchasing the claims, public or private, of
an Ottoman subject&mdash;and especially where Government paper is in
question&mdash;the <i>protégé</i> should, if official interference be likely to be
required, at once report the whole transaction to this Consulate.
British subjects and protected persons are hereby duly warned that
protection extends to life, liberty, and property, in cases where these
are threatened by violence or by injustice; but that it will not
interfere in speculations which, if undertaken by Syrian subjects of
the Porte, could not be expected to prove remunerative. British
subjects and protected persons must not expect the official interference
of the Consulate in cases where they prefer (as of late has
often happened at Damascus) to urge their claims upon the local
authorities without referring to this Consulate, and altogether ignoring
the jurisdiction of H.B.M.'s Consul. Finally, H.B.M.'s Consul
feels himself bound to protest strongly against the system adopted
by British subjects and protected persons at Damascus, who
habitually induce the Ottoman authorities to imprison peasants
and pauper debtors, either for simple debt, or upon charges which
have not been previously produced for examination at this Consulate.
The prisons will be visited once a week. An official application
will be made for the delivery of all such persons.</p>

<p>I have already related how, on August 26th, Richard received a
letter from the Rev. W. Wright, and likewise one from the Chief
Consular Dragoman, Mr. Nasif Meshaka, which induced him to
ride at once to Damascus (from Bludán, the summer quarter); how
he found that half the Christians had fled, and everything was ripe
for a new massacre; how he sought the authorities, and informed
them of their danger; induced them to have night patrols, to put
guards in the streets, to prevent Jews or Christians leaving their
houses, and to take all measures needful to convince the conspirators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
that they would not find every one sleeping as they did in 1860.
The <i>Wali</i> and all the Chief responsible Authorities were absent. The
excitement subsided under the measures recommended by him, and
in three days all was quiet, and the Christians returned to their homes.</p>

<p>I affirm that, living in safety upon the sea-coast, no man can
be a judge of the other side of the Lebanon, nor, if he does not
know some Eastern language, can he be a judge of Orientals and
their proceedings. Certain Jewish usurers had been accused of
exciting these massacres, because their lives were perfectly safe, and
they profited of the horrors to buy up property at a nominal price.
It was brought to Richard's notice that two Jewish boys, servants to
British-protected subjects, were giving the well-understood signal by
drawing crosses on the walls. Its meaning to him was clear. He
promptly investigated it, and took away the British protection of
the masters temporarily, merely reproving the boys, who had acted
under orders. He did not take upon himself to punish them.
Certain ill-advised Israelitish money-lenders fancied it was a good
opportunity to overthrow him, and with him his plan of seeing fair
proceedings on the part of the British <i>protégés</i>; so they reported to
Sir Moses Montefiore and Sir Francis Goldsmid that he had tortured
the boys. His proceedings were once, more proved just. The
correspondence on the subject was marvellously interesting, but
being official I cannot use it.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Jews"></a>Jews.</i></div>

<p>"The Jews," he writes, "from all times held a certain position in
Syria, on account of their being the financiers of the country; and
even in pre-Egyptian days Haim Farhi was able to degrade and ruin
Abdullah Pasha, of St. Jean d'Acre. In the time of Ibrahim Pasha,
about forty-four years ago,<a name="FNanchor_11_170" id="FNanchor_11_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_170" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> when the first Consuls went there, a few
were taken under British protection, and this increased their influence.
Then came the well-known history of the murder of Padre Tomaso.
After this had blown over, all the richest people of the community
tried to become British-protected subjects, or <i>protégés</i> of some
foreign Consulate. In the time of Mr. Consul (Richard) Wood,
(1840), they were humble enough. In the massacre of 1860 they
enriched themselves greatly, and men possessing £3000 rose
suddenly to £30,000. Then they had at their backs in England
Sir Moses Montefiore, Sir F. Goldsmid, and the Rothschilds<a name="FNanchor_12_171" id="FNanchor_12_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_171" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and
others, who doubtless do not know the true state of the Jewish
usurers in this part of the world. The British Consul became the
Jews' bailiff, and when we went to Syria we found them rough-riding
all the land. I speak only of the few money-lenders. When I
arrived in 1869, Shylock No. 1 came to me, and patting me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
patronizingly on the back, told me he had three hundred cases
for me, relative to collecting £60,000 of debts. I replied, 'I
think, sir, you had better hire and pay a Consul for yourself alone;
I was not sent here as a bailiff, to tap the peasant on the shoulder
in such cases as yours.' He then threatened me with the British
Government. I replied, 'It is by far the best thing you can do;
I have no power to alter a plain line of duty.' Shylock then tried
my wife's influence, but she replied that she was never allowed to
interfere in business matters. Then Sir Francis Goldsmid, to our
great surprise, wrote to Head-quarters&mdash;a rather unusual measure&mdash;as
follows: 'I hear that the lady to whom Captain Burton is
married is believed to be a bigoted Roman Catholic, and to be
likely to influence him against the Jews.' In spite of 'woman's
rights' she was not allowed the privilege of answering Sir Francis
Goldsmid officially; but I hope to convince him, even after years,
that he was misinformed."</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that religion certainly is, and ought to be, the first and
highest sentiment of our hearts, and I consider it my highest
prerogative to be a staunch and loyal Catholic. But I also claim
to be free from prejudice, and to be untrammelled in my sentiments
about other religions. Our great Master and His Apostles showed
no bigotry, and it is to them that I look for my rule of life,
not to the clique I was born in. Many amongst us Old Catholics,
who live amongst our own people, and are educated men and
women, go forth into the world and are quite unbiased against
other faiths; we take to our hearts friends, without inquiring into
their religion or politics. And if sometimes we sigh because they
are not of our way of thinking, it is not from any bigotry or party
feeling; it is because we love them, and we wish that we could give
them some of our happiness and security. I appeal to my enemies&mdash;if
I have any&mdash;to say whether I have any prejudice against race or
creed.<a name="FNanchor_13_172" id="FNanchor_13_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_172" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> At all events, I have an honest admiration and respect for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
the Jewish religion. They were the chosen people of God. They are
more akin to us than any other faith.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ was a Jew, the Apostles were Jews. He came not
to destroy the Law, but to change the prescriptions necessary for the
times. The Great Reformer was the connecting link between us.
He made Christianity, or Judaism, for the multitude, a Syro-Arabian
creed. He parted the creation into two divisions&mdash;those who accepted
the new school, and those who clung to the old. We are
of the former, and the Jews of the latter fold. It would be madness
to despise those who once ruled the ancient world, and who will
rule again&mdash;do we not see signs of their return to power every day?
It would be more than folly not to honour the old tribes of the
chosen people of God. In Syria only the Jews, Druzes, and Bedawi
can boast of their origin. In the Syrian world we know, only the
Jews and Catholics can boast of antiquity of religion. An Eastern
Jew cannot but be proud of his religion and his descent. As I turn
over my old Damascus journal, my heart warms to think that some
of our dearest native friends at Damascus were of the Jewish religion.
We were on good terms with them all, and received sincere hospitality
from them. At Trieste, again, the enlightened and hospitable
Hebrews were our best friends. It is the Jews who lead society
here, the charities and the fashion; they are the life of the town.
When I call to mind how many Jews I know, and like, and have
exchanged hospitality with, here and in the East, I do not know
how to speak strongly enough on the subject.</p>

<p>But now let us turn to the dark side of the picture. Even those
who are the proudest of their Semitic origin speak contemptuously
of their usurers. And, let me ask, do we pet and admire our own
money-lenders? Let a Damascus Jew once become a usurer, back
him up with political influence, and see what he will become. He
forgets race and creed; that touching, dignified, graceful humility
changes into fawning servility, or to brutal insolence and cruelty,
where he is not afraid. He thirsts only for money. The villanies
practised by the usurers, especially the Shylocks in Damascus, excite
every right-minded person to indignation; and if I had no other
esteem for my husband, I should owe it to him for the brave manner
in which he made a stand against these wrongs at every risk. He
knew that no other Consul had ever dared&mdash;nor would ever dare&mdash;to
oppose it; but he said simply, "I must do right; I cannot sit still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
and see what I see, and not speak the truth. I must protect the poor,
and save the British good name, <i>advienne que pourra</i>, though
perhaps in so doing I shall fall myself." And he did&mdash;but not
for this.</p>

<p>He is not what is <i>called</i> a religious man, but he acts like one;
and if he did nothing to win respect and admiration, that alone
should give people an insight into his character, whilst I, like Job's
wife, incessantly said, "Leave all this alone, as your predecessor
did, as your Consul-General does, and as your successor will do,
and keep your place, and look forward to a better." If the usurers
had been Catholics instead of Jews, I should like them to have lost
their "protection," to have been banished from Damascus, and
<i>excommunicated</i> as long as they plied their trade. More I cannot
say. Nay, I prefer the Jew to the Christian usurer. The former will
take my flesh and blood, but the Christian will want my bones too.</p>

<p>Richard writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One man alone had ruined and sucked dry forty-one villages.
He used to go to a distressed village and offer them money, keep
all the papers, and allow them nothing to show; adding interest
and compound interest, which the poor wretches could not understand.
Then he gave them no receipts for money received, so as
to be paid over and over again. The uneducated peasants had
nothing to show against the clever Jew at the Diwán, till body
and soul, wives and children, village, flocks, and land, became
his property and slaves for the sake of the small sum originally
borrowed. These men, who a few years ago were not worth much,
are now rolling in wealth. We found villages in ruins, and houses
empty, because the men were cast into jail, the children starving,
and women weeping at our feet; because these things were done in
the name of England, by the powerful arm of the British Consulate."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Usurers_try_to_remove_Richard"></a>Usurers try to remove Richard.</i></div>

<p>My husband once actually found an old man of ninety, who had
endured all the horrors of the Damascus jail during the whole of
a biting winter, for owing one of these men a napoleon (sixteen
shillings). He set him free, and ever after visited the prisons once
a week, to see whether the British-protected subjects had immured
pauper Christians and Moslems on their own responsibility. One of
the usurers told him to beware, for that he knew a Royal Highness
of England, and that he could have any Consular officer recalled at
his pleasure; and my husband replied that he and his clique could
know very little of English Royalty if they thought that it would
protect such traffic as theirs. The result of this was that they put
their heads together, and certain letters were sent to the Chief
Rabbi of London, Sir Francis Goldsmid, and Sir Moses Montefiore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
They sent telegrams and petitions, purporting to be from "all the
Jews in Damascus." We believe, however, that "all the Jews in
Damascus" knew nothing whatever about the step. Richard said,
"They are mostly a body of respectable men&mdash;hard-working, inoffensive,
and of commercial integrity, with a fair sprinkling of pious,
charitable, and innocent people." These despatches, backed by
letters from the influential persons who received them, were duly
forwarded to the Foreign Office. The correspondence was sent in
full to Richard to answer, which he did at great length, and to the
satisfaction of his Chiefs, who found that he could not have acted
otherwise.</p>

<p>Richard wrote: "I am ready to defend their lives, liberty, and
property, but I <i>will not</i> assist them in ruining villages, and in imprisoning
destitute debtors upon trumped-up charges. I would
willingly deserve the praise of every section of the Jewish community
of Damascus, but in certain cases it is incompatible with my sense
of justice and my conscience." They bragged so much in the
bazars about getting Richard recalled, that a number of sympathizing
letters were showered upon us.</p>

<p>I quote the following <i>verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Letters_of_Indignation_and_Sympathy"></a>Letters of Indignation and Sympathy.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Burton,</span></p>

<p>"We desire to express to you the great satisfaction which
Captain Burton's presence as British Consul in Damascus has
given us, both in our individual capacities and in our character of
missionaries to Syria.</p>

<p>"Since his arrival here we have had every opportunity of judging
of Captain Burton's official conduct, and we beg to express our
approval of it.</p>

<p>"The first public act that came under our notice was the removing
of dishonest officials, and the replacing them by honest ones. This
proceeding gave unmixed pleasure to every one to whom the
credit of the English name was a matter of concern. His subsequent
conduct has restored the <i>prestige</i> of the English Consulate, and we
no longer hear it said that English officials, removed from the
checks of English public opinion, are as corrupt in Turkey as
the Turks themselves. As missionaries we frankly admit that we
had been led to view Captain Burton's appointment with alarm; but
we now congratulate ourselves on having abstained, either directly or
indirectly, endeavouring to oppose his coming.</p>

<p>"Carefully following our own habitual policy of asking no consular
interference between the Turkish Government and its subjects, we
stand upon our right as Englishmen to preach and teach so long
as we violate no law of the land, and we claim for our converts the
liberty of conscience secured to them by treaty. In the maintenance
of this one right we have been firmly upheld by Captain

<p>"A few months ago, when our schools were illegally and arbitrarily
closed by the Turkish officials, he came to our aid, and the injustice
was at once put a stop to. His visit to the several village schools
under our charge proved to the native mind the Consul's interest
in the moral education of the country, which it is the object of
those schools to promote, and impressed upon the minds of local
magistrates the propriety of letting them alone.</p>

<p>"Within the last few days we had occasion to apply to Captain
Burton regarding our cemetery, which had been broken open, and
it was an agreeable surprise to us when, after two days, a police-officer
came to assure us that the damage had been repaid by the Pasha's
orders, and search was being made for the depredator.</p>

<p>"Above all, in view of any possible massacre of Christians in this
city&mdash;the all but inevitable consequence of a war between Turkey
and any Christian Power&mdash;we regard as an element of safety the
presence among us of a firm, strong man like Captain Burton, as
representing the English interests.</p>

<p>"When, not long ago, a panic seized the city, and a massacre
seemed imminent, Captain Burton immediately came down from his
summer quarters, and by his presence largely contributed to restore
tranquillity. All the other important Consuls fled from Damascus,
and thus increased the panic.</p>

<p>"We earnestly hope that Captain Burton will not suffer himself
to be annoyed by the enmity he is sure to provoke for all who wish
to make the English name a cover for wrongs and injustice, or
think that a British subject or <i>protégé</i> should be supported, whatever
be the nature of his case.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;By-the-by, on one occasion one of the most important Jews
of Damascus, when conversing with me [Wm. Wright] and the Rev.
John Crawford, American missionary, said that Captain Burton was
unfit for the British Consulate in Damascus; and the reason he
gave was that, being an upright man, he transacted his business by
fair means instead of by foul.</p>

<p>"Damascus, November 28th, 1870."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Isabel</span>,</p>

<p>"I was calling at a native house yesterday, where I found
assembled some leading people of Damascus. The conversation
turned upon Captain Burton and the present British Consulate.
One word led to another; and I heard, to my surprise and consternation,
that men famed for their <i>various pecuniary</i> transactions
are boasting about everywhere 'that, upon <i>their</i> representations, <i>the
Consul is to be recalled</i>,' and all Damascus is grieved and indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
at them. For my part I cannot, will not, believe that her Majesty's
Government would set aside a man of Captain Burton's standing,
and well-known justice and capacity in public affairs, for the sake
of these Jews, who are desolating the villages and ruining those who
have the misfortune to fall into their clutches. He is also so
thoroughly adapted for this Babel of tongues, nations, and religions,
and is so rapidly raising our English Consulate from the low estimation
in which it had fallen in the eyes of all men, to the position it
ought to and would occupy under the rule of an incorruptible, firm,
and impartial character like Captain Burton's.</p>

<p>"At the risk of vexing you, I must tell you what I now hear commonly
reported in the bazar, for several merchants and others have
asked me if it was true. [Here follows the history of the complaints.]
Our present Consul is too much a friend to the oppressed, and
examines too much everything <i>himself</i>, to suit their money transactions.
The Consulate for an age has not been so respectable as now; and
should you really go, I should think any future Consul would shrink
to do his duty, for fear of his conduct being misrepresented at home.
You must write me a line to tell me the truth, if you may do so
without indiscretion; and people are wanting to write to the Foreign
Office and the <i>Times</i>, so provoked are they at the lies and duplicity.
The day I was with you and you refused to see Judas and the other
Jew, who seemed to dodge you about like a house cat, and looking
so ill at ease and in a fright, did you then suspect or know anything
about all this?</p>

<p>"With regard to the Arab tribes, they too have an admiration
for Captain Burton's dauntless character and straightforward dealing,
so different from others. You know that Shaykh Mohammed el
Dhúky and Farés el Mézyad openly say so in the desert.</p>

<p>"I had intended to scribble but two lines, and I have been led
on till my note has become a long letter. So, good-bye; and I
truly hope all these machinations will end in the discomfiture of
their inventors.</p>

<p>To conclude: the effect of their conduct in Damascus will fall
upon their own heads, and upon their children. Do not purposely
misunderstand me, O Israel! Remember, I do not speak of you
disparagingly as a nation, or as a faith. As such I love and admire
you; but I pick out your usurers from among you, as the goats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
from the sheep. You are ancient in birth and religion; you are
sometimes handsome, always clever, and in many things you far
outstrip us Christians in the race of life. Your sins and your
faults are, and have been, equally remarkable from all time. Many
of you, in Damascus especially, are as foolish and stiff-necked as
in the days of old. When the time comes, and it will come, the
trampled worm will turn. The Moslem will rise not really against
the Christian&mdash;he will only be the excuse&mdash;but against you. Your
quarter will be the one to be burnt down; your people to be
exterminated, and all your innocent tribe will suffer for the few
guilty.</p>

<p>A Druze of the Haurán once said to me, "I have the greatest
temptation to burn down A&mdash;&mdash;'s house. I should be sent to Istambul
in chains, but what of that? I should free my village and my
people." I begged of him not to think of such a crime. A
sinister smile passed over his face, and he muttered low in his
beard, "No, not yet! not yet! Not till the next time. And
then not much of the Yahúd will be left when we have done with
them." I quote this as a specimen of the ill-feeling bred over the
interior of Syria by their over-greed of gain. And I only hope that
the powerful Israelite Committees and Societies of London and Paris
will&mdash;and they can if they will&mdash;curb the cupidity of their countrymen
in Syria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Omar_Beys_Fine_Mare_Horse-breeding"></a>Omar Bey's Fine Mare&mdash;Horse-breeding.</i></div>

<p>We were present at a very grand review, where a splendid mare,
ridden by Omar Bey, was the centre of attraction, and the newspapers
afterwards noticed her in the following manner:&mdash;</p>


<h5>Cutting from the <i>Boomerang</i>.</h5>


<blockquote>

<p>"Lady Burton mentions a very fine mare which Omar Bey, a
Turkish brigadier-general at Damascus, bought from some Arabs
after a free fight in the desert. She was so handsome that at a
grand review, the only one held while Sir Richard Burton was Consul
at Damascus, neither Lady Burton nor her husband could look at
anything else. Omar Bey was subsequently ordered to leave the
district, and sold the mare for £80, being all she would fetch at the
time. It does seem a pity that, in a great horse-breeding country
like Australia, there are not men to be found patriotic enough to
secure specimens of these famous breeds of antiquity. We have
plenty of breeders willing and anxious to secure and continue the
breed of the English thoroughbred, but although we are possessed
of some of the finest areas in the world for horse-breeding, and in
a climate analogous in many respects to Mesopotamia, the original
home of the horse, we have unfortunately no one among all those
who have amassed wealth who will, either for pleasure or profit, take
in hand the formation of a pure Arabian stud. There can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
question that in this country, where feed is not a matter of consideration,
the Arabian would grow to a very much larger size."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Holy_Land"></a>The Holy Land.</i></div>

<p>We at last determined to thoroughly do Palestine and the Holy
Land, and we went down in an awfully rough sea, in a very tiny and
dirty little Egyptian steamer, as far as Jaffa. There were great doubts
as to whether we could land, but at last boats were put out, and we
got in on the top of a truly alarming surf, shooting through a narrow
hole in the rocks just wide enough to admit the boat. The plain
of Sharon was looking beautiful&mdash;meadows of grass land, wild flowers,
cultivation, and orange groves all along our forty mile-ride.</p>

<p>I shall not say much about this pilgrimage, because it is too well
known, except that we remained long enough to see and learn everything
by heart about every place where our Saviour and His followers
ever were in Syria, not only with the Bible and "Tancred," but learning
all the legends, and the folklore handed from father to son. I
have given a very long account of this in my "Inner Life of Syria" (2
vols., 1875), so that I don't want to repeat it again.</p>

<p>With Richard it was a constant matter for thought whether the sites
and the tombs were the correct ones; and the sword of Godfrey de
Bouillon and the Crusaders' arms, also those of the Knight Templars,
were always of immense interest to him. We visited all the Patriarchs,
and principally Monseigneur Valerga, a man of brilliant education, with
the <i>savoir faire</i> of the diplomat or courtier, blended with religion.
We went through all the ceremonies of <i>all the numerous religions</i>
during the Holy Week, the Mohammedan as well as the fourteen
Christian sects, and Jewish, of which not the least touching thing is
the wailing of the Jews outside the wall of the Temple on Fridays,
and the Greek fire on Holy Saturday. A Jewish friend took us in
for the Passover. We visited all the country of St. John, Bethlehem,
Hebron, where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Rebecca, and Leah
are buried; to Mar Saba, where is the Convent of Penitent
Monks, in a most wonderful ravine. From there we got down to the
Dead Sea, and swam in it, and saw fish. It receives daily seven
million tons of water, and has no outlet; but its evaporation forms the
desert of salt, called the Ghor, all round its southern shore, which
fact Richard compares with Tanganyika. From there we went into
Moab; we visited Moses' Tomb on the return journey. At Bethábara
we bathed, and brought home bottles of the water of the Jordan;
thence we went to Jericho, but we took care to visit every spot
where tradition and folklore says our Saviour touched at, <i>off the
tracks</i> besides. We encamped on the supposed sites of Sodom and
Gomorrah, and so on to Bethel, and Hai, the most ancient site in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
Palestine, the camping-ground of Abraham, where he and Lot parted
and divided their flocks; and we gradually made our way to Nablus,
which is the boundary between the Damascus and Jerusalem Consular
jurisdictions. We ascended Mount Ebal and Mount Gerízim, and
stayed with the Samaritans, who then numbered a hundred and
thirty-five. We then went to Samaria, and through the plain of
Esdraelon; and we camped at ancient Engannin, where Christ cured
the ten lepers. From thence to Scythopolis into the Ghor, and to
as many sites of the towns of the Decapolis as we could realize. We
went to Naim, and Endor, and Tabor, and Nazareth&mdash;at Nazareth
we were stoned (a little political manœuvre); thence to Cana. About
Nazareth Richard wrote in his private journal&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I rode down the country by the vile Kunayterah road to Tiberias,
where the Jews protected by our Government were complaining that
the <i>Wali</i> had taken from them and had sold to the Greek Bishop
Nifon, at Nazareth, a cemetery and synagogue, which for the last
four hundred years had belonged to their faith, and to visit a few
men who held British passports, which ought to have been annually
changed, but had through carelessness not been renewed since 1850.
For these acts, I was destined to the same honour as my Master,
namely, being stoned out of Nazareth; and because I did good to
the Jews, they also betrayed me to the Authorities, and asked for
my recall."</p></blockquote>

<p>We went up the Mountain of Precipitation to Hattín, and ascended
to Tiberias, the second and the middle sea which feeds the Jordan,
and we visited the site of the eight towns so much frequented by
our Saviour. From thence we went to Sáfed, which is a very
fanatical Jewish Holy City, from which we could see the Jaulán
and the Haurán stretching right away into the Arabian desert of the
ancient kingdom of Báshan; and from here we again made our way
to the plain of Huleh, which we remember of old, and the Waters of
Merom, where we camped before under difficulties, and so nearly
got a bad fever. This time it was black from a recent prairie fire.
The best amusement on these occasions is to laugh at one another's
miserable, unrecognizable faces, all swollen with bites and stings, like
the face one sees in a spoon. After a lot of other places, we got
back to Birket er Ram or Lake Phiala, which I remember saying a
while ago we determined to revisit. Richard found something that
excited his attention about it, so we emptied the water out of all
our goat-skins, blew them up with air, strapped them to our camp-table,
made a raft, and used the tent-poles for oars. It is supposed
to have no bottom, is six hundred yards broad, and about nine
hundred wide. We sounded with the lead, and the deepest part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
proved to be seventeen feet and a half. It has a weed bottom and
leeches below, no shells; but the air began to whistle out of the skins,
and Richard and Charley Drake only just got back in time to save
themselves a swim.</p>

<p>Whilst at Jerusalem and its environs Richard did two very graceful
things. He saw a monk conducting a party of Catholics, who wanted
to say prayers in the Sepulchre itself at three o'clock on Good
Friday. It was invaded by the usual class of tourists. The
monk shrunk back with his people, and the particular time for
these prayers was slipping away. Richard stepped forward, and,
touching his cap, said, "What is the matter, Father?" He said,
"The Sepulchre is full of tourists, who are not Catholics. We have
no right to turn them out, and we don't like to push in and begin
our devotions." Richard said, "Leave that to me." He went in
and explained to them, and they came out. Richard then passed
the monk and his party in, and he stood guard himself outside the
whole time they performed their devotion, and would not let any
one pass. These little acts used to win him the heart of everybody.</p>

<p>Another day we were riding in rather a desert place about a mile
from a small village; we met a solitary priest and his acolyte. I was
about to ride up to speak to him, when he gave me the sign&mdash;I mean
the sign the priest gives you when he is secretly carrying the Blessed
Sacrament. I told it to Richard, who ordered his men to draw up
in two lines for the priest to pass through and salute. He jumped
down from his own horse, and offered it to the priest, asking to
accompany him. The priest declined it, but he blessed him as he
passed. I always thought of this afterwards in Austria, when I saw
the large picture in the Palace at Innsbruck, of Rudolph the Second
of Hapsburg doing the same thing.</p>

<p>At Jerusalem we explored the Mágharat el Kotn; these are
enormous quarries, also called the Royal Caverns. The entrance
looks like a hole in the wall outside the town, not far from the Gate
of Damascus. Creeping in, you find yourself in endless caves and
galleries unexplored. We used to use magnesium fusees, and take
plenty of ropes to have a clue.</p>

not mean Mr. Disraeli as Prime Minister of England, but the author of "Tancred."
I read the book as a young girl in my father's house, and it inspired me with all
the ideas, and the yearning for a wild Oriental life, which I have since been able
to carry out. I passed two years of my early life, when emerging from the school-room,
in my father's garden, and the beautiful woods around us, alone with
"Tancred." My family were pained and anxious about me&mdash;thought me odd;
wished I would play the piano, do worsted work, write notes, read the circulating
library&mdash;in short, what is generally called improving one's mind; and I
was pained because I could not. My uncle used to pat my head, and "hope
for better things." I did not know it then, I do now: I was working out
the problem of my future life, my after mission. It lived in my saddle-pocket
throughout my Eastern life. I almost know it by heart, so that when I came to
Bethany, to the Lebanon, and to Mukhtár&mdash;when I found myself in a Bedawi
camp, or amongst the Maronite and Druze strongholds, or in the society of
Fakredeens&mdash;nothing surprised me. I felt as if I had lived that life for years.
I felt that I went to the tomb of my Redeemer in the proper spirit, and I found
what I sought. The presence of God was actually felt, though invisible. The

<p>It must not be supposed that Richard was the least insincere,
because he tried religions all round. He wanted to get at the
highest, the nearest to God, the nearest to other worlds, and in that
respect he was like Cardinal Newman. He always spoke the truth,
and if he changed every other day, he would have said so. Every
time he was disappointed with a religion he fell back on mysticism.
It was the soul wandering through space, like the dove out of the ark,
and seeking a place whereupon to rest. In each religion he found
something good, and much that disappointed him; then he took the
good out of that religion, and went away. He was sincere with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
Mohammedans, and found more in that religion than in <i>most</i>. He
hoped much from spiritualism, and studied it well; but he could
make nothing of it as a religion. It never seemed to bring him
any nearer; but he believed in it as in the light of a future
frontier of science. <i>His</i> Agnosticism, which in his case is a misapplied
word, was of a much higher cast; it was the mysticism
of the East. It was the tired soul or brain that said, "Oh, my
God, I have studied all things, and I am still no nearer the point
of closer connection with Thee, whom my soul longs for and aims
at. I know nothing; I can touch nothing. Faith is a gift from
Thee; give it to me!" He became impressed with one fact
here in Syria, as he had done at Baroda in his youth, and that
is that Catholicism is the highest order of Spiritualism, having no
connection with jugglery, or table-turning, or spirit-rapping; that
we cannot call it up at our pleasure, nor pay for it; but that,
when something <i>does</i> happen, it is absolutely <i>real</i>, only we are not
allowed to speak of it, except amongst ourselves, and then with
bated breath. Richard, however, had opportunity enough of seeing
all this for himself in Syria, in Damascus, where some very extraordinary
things were going on, that were, without a doubt,
genuine.</p>

<p>During the time we were at Damascus, there was a "mystery"
going on in the lower quarter, called the Maydán&mdash;the tail of
Damascus, which runs out towards the desert&mdash;amongst a certain sect
of the Mohammedans, called the Shádilis, or Sházlis. They used to
assemble at nights together at the house of one of them for Moslem
prayer and reading and discussion, when they became conscious of
a presence amongst them that was not theirs. They used to hear
things and see things which they did not understand, and this went
on for two or three months before they came to an understanding.
I let my husband tell the story in his own words, and you will all
understand later on how it found its way into my "Inner Life of
Syria."</p>

<p>Fray Emanuel Förner, who figures largely in this history, was
a friend Richard used to study with. He confided his troubles
relative to these people to us. He asked us whether, as Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
had more influence with the Moslems than any one else, he could
be induced to protect them. Richard felt that it was going beyond
the boundary of his Consular prerogative to interfere in a matter
which concerned the national religion; he therefore answered him
that his position obliged him to abstain from interfering in so
interesting a matter, although he could do so in cases where the
<i>Protestant</i> schools or missions formally claimed protection against
the violation of the treaties and concessions of the Hatti-Sheríf.
He added that the Spanish Consul was the proper person for him
to apply to, being <i>his</i> Consul, and that it was his duty likewise
to restrict me from any active part which might compromise the
Consulate.</p>

<p>But this interested him enormously. He thought he saw his way
in it to the highest kind of religion, and he followed it up <i>unofficially</i>.
Disguised as a Sházli, and unknown to any mortal except me, he
used to mix with them, and pass much of his time in the Maydán
of Damascus with them; and <i>he saw what he saw</i>; and when, as in
reading this account you will see, Fray Förner was the guide who
was pointed out to them by that spiritual Presence, Richard stuck
to him, and with him used to study the Sházlis and their history.
This gave him an enormous interest in Damascus, but it was his
ruin; and the curious Spiritualism, <i>if you like to term it so</i>, that
was developing there was almost like a "new advent," and though
he did not then <i>mean</i> it, he ended by sacrificing his worldly career
entirely to it.</p>

<p>It was not for a whole year after the event of my disagreement
with the Shaykh's son at Zebedáni (which missionaries of the British
Syrian schools have since reported as the cause of my husband's
recall, after which the same Shaykh had become one of my most
faithful followers, but which had nothing to do with my husband's
misfortunes), that twelve of the most favoured of these Sházlis had
been seized, transported in chains, and partially martyred. Fray
Förner died curiously, and Richard came and told me all this, with
a great deal more than I had known, or than <i>has</i>, or <i>ever will be</i>
published, about the Sházlis, and he was filled with remorse that
he had not taken up their case and protected them.</p>

<p>He had written up their case. He said, "If I should write to
Lord Granville, and tell him that there are at least twenty-five
thousand of secret Christians longing for baptism, and if I were
to say, as I know I can, that I can arrange it with the Moslems to
<i>give them to me</i>, and not to touch them because they are <i>mine</i>;
supposing I were to buy a tract of land and give it to them, and
build a village, and that I took no taxes from them in repayment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
they could settle there unmolested, and supposing that I
should request the Patriarch Valerga of Jerusalem to come and
baptize them, would <i>you</i> be afraid to stand godmother for them with
<i>me</i> on guard?" and I replied that "I would be only too proud to
do it." It was then settled that these letters should be written
and sent.</p>

<p>Lord Granville communicated with the Patriarch Valerga, who at
once sent <i>openly</i> and <i>clumsily</i> to the Turkish <i>Authorities</i> at Damascus
to know the truth, thereby <i>starting an evil</i>; and, <i>even so</i>, four hundred
were found who were willing for martyrdom, but the Patriarch was
evidently in <i>no</i> hurry for martyrdom. The affair, instead of being
confided to Richard, was hopelessly mismanaged, and his recall
followed within the month; and Richard said, "This is suffering persecution
for justice' sake; <i>no more of this, till I am clear of a just and
enlightened Government</i>." It broke his career, it shattered his life, it
embittered him on religion; he got neither Teheran, nor Marocco,
nor Constantinople. I may be wrong, but I have always imagined
that he thought that Christ would stand by him, and see him through
his troubles, but he did not like to speak of it. Richard never asked
a single word at the Foreign Office&mdash;he was too proud; and he let
me do it in a Blue Book of our own. My friends in the Foreign
Office, of whom I had about thirteen, gave me <i>each</i> a <i>different</i> reason
for the recall; but when I got an audience with Lord Granville, I
got the true one. Syria and Christianity lost one of England's
greatest men, who was ruined, and her descent in prosperity and
happiness commenced; and I never heard that the Government,
or the Foreign Office, or the Service, or the British name in the
East, was any better for it. I humbly venture to think the contrary.
He wrote himself the history of the "Revival of Christianity in
Syria."</p>

<p>When I brought out my "Inner Life of Syria," Richard brought
me the following account, blushing like a schoolboy, and asked me
if I would insert it in my own name&mdash;if I would mind, as I could
not be godmother to the Sházlis, being godmother to <i>it</i>.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Christian Revival in Syria</span>.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Men are four. He who knows not, and knows not he knows not, he is
a fool&mdash;shun him; he who knows not, and knows he knows not, he is simple&mdash;teach

<p>"'What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the

but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy

<p>"'Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the

<p>"Christianity was born and grew in Syria. She gave the light of
the Gospel to the world. The grace of God has returned to Syria.
Shall she struggle single-handed with Moslem cruelty and oppression,
unaided by the Christian Powers who owe to her the Light of Faith?</p>

<p>"The heading of these pages will not a little surprise many, but
not all of my readers, who will be divided into two classes&mdash;those
familiar with old prophecies, and those who are not. The first will
expect, the others will not expect, to hear that Christianity has revived
spontaneously, unaided by Missionaries, Catechists, or Consuls,
in this fanatical Moslem land, especially in Damascus, the 'Gate of
the Holy City,' the ancient capital of the Caliphs, where, even at
present, Christian representatives of Great Powers are not allowed to
fly their flags. But the movement has taken place; it grows every
year; its consequences are difficult to see, impossible to calculate.
The conversion of the Mohammedans has begun at last, without
England's sending out, as is her custom, shiploads of Bibles, or
spending one fraction upon it; and in this great work, so glorious
to Christianity, England, if old traditions are about to be verified, is
to have a large share. She must now decide whether the Revival of
Christianity, in the land which gave it birth, shall spread its goodly
growth far and wide, or whether it shall be cut down by the hand of
the destroyer.</p>

<p>"The first step in this movement, taken as far back as 1868, was
heralded by signs and tokens and graces, which partake of the
miracle and of the revelation. And here, at the beginning, I may
remind my readers, especially Protestant readers, that the Lord has
a mighty arm&mdash;'<i>brachium Domini non est abbreviatum</i>'&mdash;and that
in this same City of Damascus, the terrible persecutor, Saul of Tarsus,
became St. Paul, not by reading, nor by conversations with Christians,
but by the direct interposition of Jesus Christ. The visions
and revelations which I am about to record rest upon the same solid
basis as Christianity itself&mdash;that is to say, upon the unanimous
testimony borne to them by sincere and devout men, who have no
purpose to serve, and who have risked their all in this world without
any possible object but to testify to mankind the truths revealed to
them. We need not delay to consider whether the graces and tokens
which have been vouchsafed are natural, preternatural, or supernatural;
objective or subjective. Suffice it for us that they have
been submitted to crucial tests, and that even this philosophic and
incredulous age cannot deny that they have taken place.</p>

<p>"About four years ago a small body of Moslems who inhabit the
Maydán, or southern suburb of Damascus, had been initiated into
the Shádili Order of Moslems by one Abd el Karim Matar, of
Darayya, whose touching end will presently be recounted. This
man, a mere peasant, left his wife, his family, and his relations in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
native village, in order to become Shaykh of the Dervishes, and he
hired a house in the Sukhkháneh quarter of the Maydán. It is
bisected by the long street through which the annual Hajj Caravan
passes out <i>en route</i> to Mecca, and its inhabitants, with those of the
Shaghur quarter, are held to be the most bigoted and fanatical of
their kind. Through the influence of the Shádilis, however, not a
Christian life was lost in their quarter during the dreadful massacre
of 1860; many, indeed, were hidden by the people in their houses,
and were sent privily away without the walls after the three days of
bloodshed had passed. Our Lord, who promises to remember even
the cup of cold water given in His name, did not, as will presently
appear, forget these acts of mercy to the terrified Christians.</p>

<p>"I am going to assume that all my readers are not perfectly <i>au
courant</i> of the many subdivisions of the influential and widespread
religion&mdash;El Islam.</p>

<p>"The Order of Shádili Dervishes was founded by Abd el Husayn
Shádili, who died at Mecca in A.H. 656 (A.D. 1258). They are not,
therefore, one of the twelve originally instituted, and for that reason
they are rarely noticed by writers upon Eastern Spiritualism (for
instance, 'The Dervishes,' by John P. Brown. London: Trübner,
1868). They obtained fame, however, by introducing to the world
coffee, so called from the Abyssinian province of Kafa. The use of
coffee in Yemen, its origin and first introduction into that country,
are due to the learned Ali Shádili Abu Omar, one of the disciples of
the learned doctor Nasr Ood Deen, who is regarded as one of the
Chiefs, and whose worth attests the high degree of spirituality to
which they had attained ('First Footsteps in East Africa,' p. 78.
London: 1856).</p>

<p>"The Shádili are Sufis or Mystics, esoterics from El Islam, who
have attempted to spiritualize its material portions. This order, like
all others, admits of two main divisions, the Sharai or orthodox, and
the Ghayr-Sharai, who have greatly departed from the doctrines of
El Islam.</p>

<p>"The vital tenets of the heterodox are&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. God alone exists. He is in all things and all things are in
Him&mdash;evidently mere pantheism.</p>

<p>"2. All things visible and invisible are an emanation from Him,
and are not really distinct from Him&mdash;this is the Eastern origin of
the classical European '<i>divinæ particula auræ</i>.'</p>

<p>"3. Heaven and hell and all the dogmas of positive faiths are
allegories, whose esoteric meaning is known only to the Sufi.</p>

<p>"4. Religions are a matter of indifference; that, however, is the
best which serves as a means of reaching true knowledge, such as El
Islam, whose philosophy is Tasawwuf (Sufi-ism).</p>

<p>"5. There is no real distinction between good and evil, for all
things are one, and God fixes the will of man, whose actions therefore
are not free.</p>

<p>"6. The soul existed before the body, and is confined in it as
a bird in a cage. Death therefore is desirable to the Sufi, whose
spirit returns to the Deity whence it emanated. Evidently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
'Anupadishesha Nirvana' of the Hindu, absolute individual annihilation.</p>

<p>"7. The principal duty of the Sufi is meditation on the unity
which advances him progressively to spiritual perfection, and which
enables him to 'die in God.'</p>

<p>"8. Without 'Fayz Ullah' (Grace of God) this spiritual unity
cannot be attained; but God favours those who fervently desire
such unification.</p>

<p>"The general belief in these tenets has given the Shádili Order
a doubtful name amongst the multitude, who consider it to profess,
like the 'Babis' of Persia, opinions of a subversive and anti-Islamitic
nature. The orthodox portion, however, is not blamed, and at
Damascus one of its members is a conscientiously religious Moslem,
the Sayyid Abd el Kadir of Algerian fame, whose name is still so
well known in Europe, and who is beloved and respected by all.
The Syrian Shádilis are distinguished by white robes and white
skull-caps and turbans, of which they allow the inner flap to protrude
a little from the folds behind the ears.</p>

<p>"Abd el Karim Matar and his Shádili acolytes used to meet for
private worship at his house in the Maydán suburb, and they spent
nights and days in praying for enlightenment before the throne of
Grace. Their numbers varied from sixty to seventy, and even more.
Presently, after persevering in this new path, some of them began
to be agitated by doubts and disbelief; the religion did not satisfy
them, they anxiously sought for a better. They became uncertain,
disquieted, undetermined, yet unable, for fear of being betrayed, to
declare even one to another the thought which tormented them.
Two years had been spent in this anxious, unhappy state, each
thinking himself the only one thus subject to the tortures of conscience.</p>

<p>"At length they were assured by a vision that it was the religion
of Christ which they were seeking. Yet such was their dread of
treachery that none could trust his secret with his neighbour till
they had sounded one another, and had found that the same idea
was uppermost in every mind. Presently about forty of them,
headed by Abd el Karim Matar, met for their usual night-prayers;
after prolonged devotional acts, all fell asleep, and our Lord was
pleased to appear to all of them separately. They awoke simultaneously,
and one, taking courage, recounted his vision to the
others, when each responded, 'I also saw Him!' Christ had so
consoled, comforted, and exhorted them to follow His faith, and
they were so filled with a joy they had never known, that they were
hardly dissuaded from running about the streets to proclaim that
Christ is God; but they were admonished that they would only
be slaughtered, and rob the City of all hope of entering the
same fold.</p>

<p>"They wanted a guide, director, and friend who could assist their
tottering steps in the new way which they were now treading, and
they heartily prayed that God would be pleased mercifully to provide
them with the object of their desire. One night, after again meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
as before, for acts of devotion, sleep overcame them, and they saw
themselves in a Christian church, where an old man with a long
white beard, dressed in a coarse brown serge garment, and holding
a lighted taper, glided before them, and smiling benignantly never
ceased to cry, 'Let those who want the truth follow me.'</p>

<p>"On awaking each told his dream to the other, and they agreed
to occupy themselves in seeking the person who had appeared to
them. They searched in vain through the City and its environs for
a period of three months, during which they continued to pray.
One day it so happened that one of the new converts, H&mdash;- K&mdash;&mdash;,
now at J&mdash;&mdash;, entered by chance the monastery of the R.R. Fathers
of the Terra Santa, near Bab Tuma, the north-eastern gate of Damascus.
This is an establishment of Spanish Franciscans, who
enjoy French protection by virtue of a Papal Bull and of immemorial
usage. What was his astonishment to see in the Superior,
Fray Emanuel Förner, the personage who had appeared to him in
his dream. This saintly man, Latin Curé and Franciscan of the
Terra Santa, approached and asked the Moslem what he was seeking.
The Neophyte replied by simply telling his tale and that of
his comrades, and then ran speedily to inform the others, who
flocked next day to the monastery. The poor padre was greatly
perplexed. He reflected that visions do not happen every day. He
feared some political intrigue, of which Damascus is a focus; he
doubted their sincerity, and he dreaded to endanger the City, and
to cause for the sake of the forty another massacre like that of 1860.
On the other hand, he still more dreaded to lose forty sincere souls
by refusing to them baptism. However, concealing his agitation, he
received them with touching kindness; he gave them books which
taught them all the Christian doctrine, and he instructed them how
to meet in prayer for mutual comfort and support. Lastly, he distributed
to each a crucifix, the symbol of their new faith. This
event took place in the early spring of 1870. Fray Emanuel remained
for about four months in this state of dilemma, praying to
know the will of God, and he was admonished as to what he should
do. Having performed his task on earth, he fell asleep quietly one
day about three months afterwards. Some said the death was caused
by climate, but many of his most intimate friends, living a few hours
from the convent, did not hear of it till late in November, 1870, and
then they had cause to suspect treachery.</p>

<p>"The converts, now numbering some two hundred and fifty, held
regular prayer-meetings in one another's houses, and these could not
fail to attract the notice of the neighbouring Moslems. Later still
a crucifix or two was seen, and suspicions ripened into certainties.
The local authorities were at once informed of what had happened.
The Ulemá, or learned men, who in El Islam represent the Christian
priesthood, were in consternation. They held several sessions
at the house of Shakyh Dabyan, a noted fanatic living in the Maydán
suburb. At length a general meeting took place in the town-house
of the Algerine Amir Abd el Kadir, who has ever been held one of
the 'Defenders of the Faith' at Damascus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>

<p>"The assembly consisted of the following Ulemá:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Shaykh Riza Effendi el Ghazzi.</p>

<p>"2. Abdullah el Hálabi.</p>

<p>"3. Shaykh el Tantáwi.</p>

<p>"4. Shaykh el Kháni.</p>

<p>"5. Shaykh Abdu Razzak (el Baytar) and his brother.</p>

<p>"6. Shaykh Mohammed el Baytar.</p>

<p>"7. Shaykh Salím Samára.</p>

<p>"8. Shaykh Abd el Gháni el Maydáni.</p>

<p>"9. Shaykh Ali ibn Sa'ati.</p>

<p>"10. Said Effendi Ustuwáneh (the Naib el Kazi, or assistant judge
in the Criminal Court of the Department at Damascus), and other
intimates of the Amir.</p>

<p>"Riza Effendi, now dead, was a determined persecutor of the
Nazarene, and Abdullah el Hálabi, also deceased, had pronounced
in 1860 the Fatwa or religious decree for the massacre of the
Christian Community, and had been temporarily banished instead
of being hanged as high as Haman. These specimens will suffice.
Still let us be just to the President of this assembly, Abd el Kadir.
He was carrying out a religious duty in sitting in judgment upon
renegades from his faith, and he was acting in accordance with his
conscience; but during the massacre of 1860 he not only extended
his protection to the Christians, but he slept across his own threshold
on a mat, lest any terrified and supplicating wretch might be turned
adrift by his Algerine followers.</p>

<p>"The assembly, after a long discussion, pronounced the sentence
of death upon the converts. The only exceptions were the Amir
Abd el Kadir and the Shaykh Abd el Gháni el Maydáni, who
declared 'that a live man is always better than a dead man.' The
Shaykhs Tantáwi and El Kháni declared 'that to kill such perverts
was an act more acceptable to Allah than the Friday prayer.'</p>

<p>"If there be one idea more strongly fixed than any other in
Moslem brain it is this&mdash;the renegade from El Islam shall surely die.
His death must be compassed by any means, fair or foul: perjury
and assassination are good deeds when devoted to such an end.
The Firman of February 12th, 1856, guaranteed, it is true, life and
liberty to <i>all</i> converts; it was, in fact, a perfect system of religious
toleration on paper. But it was never intended to be carried out,
and the local Turkish authorities throughout the Empire have,
doubtless acting under superior instruction, ignored it as much as
possible.</p>

<p>"The usual practice in the Turkish dominions when a convert is
to be convicted, opens with a preliminary imprisonment, either on
pretence of 'counselling' him, or upon some false charge. The
criminal tribunal then meets; witnesses are suborned; the defence
is not listened to; a <i>mázbatah</i>, or sentence, is drawn out, and the
victim is either drafted off with the Nizam (regular troops), or sent
to the galleys, or transported to some distant spot. The assembly,
however, not daring to carry out the sentence of death, determined
that the perverts must be exiled, and that their houses and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
goods must be destroyed or confiscated. A secret <i>Majlis</i> was convened
without the knowledge of the Christian members of the
tribunal, and this illegal junto despatched, during the night, a
squadron of cavalry and a regiment of infantry, supported by a
strong force of police, to occupy the streets of the Maydán. Some
fifty Shádilis were known to have met for prayer at the house of one
Abu Abbas. At four o'clock Turkish time (10 p.m.) they rose to
return home. Many of them passed amongst the soldiery without
being alarmed, and whilst so doing fourteen were separately arrested
and carried to the <i>karakuns</i> (guard-houses) known as El Ka'ah, and
the Sinnaníyyeh. Here they were searched by the soldiery and
made to give up their crucifixes. They were then transferred, some
to the so-called great prison in the Serai, or Government house, others
to the <i>karakun</i> jail in the Government square, and others to the
debtors' jail, then at the Maristán, or Mad-house, now transferred to
Sidr Amud, near Bab el Baríd.</p>

<p>"I hasten to record the names of the fourteen chosen for the
honour of martyrdom. All were sincere and inoffensive men, whose
only crime was that of being Christians and martyrs; the rulers,
however, had resolved upon crushing a movement which, unless
arrested by violence, would spread far and wide throughout the
land.</p>

(tribunal), at which presided in person his Excellency the <i>Wali</i>, or
Governor-General, of Syria, Mohammed Rashíd Pasha. This officer,
a <i>protégé</i> of the late Aali Pasha, Grand Vizier at Constantinople, has
been allowed to rule the province of Syria for the unusual term of
more than five years, and the violence and rapacity displayed by
him and his creatures have doubtless added an impulse to the
Revival of Christianity&mdash;it was evil working for good. With a
smattering of Parisian education, utterly without religion, but determined
to crush conversion because it would add to that European
influence which he has ever laboured to oppose, Rashíd Pasha never
conceals his conviction that treaties and firmans upon such a subject
as Moslem conversion are so much waste paper, and he threatens all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
who change their faith with death, either by law or by secret murder&mdash;a
threat which, as the cold cruelty of his nature suggests, is not
spoken in vain. And he uses persecution with the more readiness
as it tends to conciliate the pious of his own creed, who are greatly
scandalized by his openly neglecting the duties of his religion, such
as prayer and fasting, and by other practices which may not be
mentioned here.</p>

<p>"The Governor-General opened the sessions by thus addressing
the accused&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you Shádili?</p>

<p>"Answer: We once were, we now are not.</p>

<p>"Gov.-Gen.: Why do you meet in secret, and what is done at
those meetings?</p>

<p>"Answer: We read, we converse, we pray, and we pass our time
like other Damascus people.</p>

<p>"Gov.-Gen.: Why do you visit the Convent of the Faranj (Franks
or Europeans)?</p>

<p>"Abu Abbas: Is it not written in our law that when a Moslem
passes before a Christian church or convent, and finds himself hurried
by the hour for prayer, he is permitted to enter and even pray there?</p>

<p>"Gov.-Gen.: You are Giaours (infidels)!</p>

<p>"Abu Abbas (addressing one of the Ulemá): What says our law
of one who calls a faithful man Giaour?</p>

<p>"Answer: That he is himself a Giaour.</p>

<p>"The Governor-General was confounded by this decision, which
is strictly correct. He remanded the fourteen to their respective
prisons. Here they spent three months awaiting in vain the efforts
of some intercessor. But they had been secretly tried, or their
number might have attracted public attention; the affair was kept
in darkness, and even two years afterwards not a few of the
Europeans resident at Damascus had ever heard of it. The report
reached the Consular corps in a very modified form&mdash;persecution
had been made to assume the semblance of political punishment.
The Russian Consul, M. Macceef, succeeded in procuring their
temporary release, but this active and intelligent officer was unable to
do more. The British Consul could hardly enter into a matter which
was not brought officially before his notice. The Consul of France
and the Spanish Vice-Consul took scant notice of the Shádili movement,
perhaps being unwilling to engage in open warfare with the
Governor-General, possibly deeming the matter one of the usual
tricks to escape recruitment or to obtain a foreign passport. The
Neophytes, however, found an advocate in Fray Emanuel Förner,
before mentioned. This venerable man addressed (March 29, 1870)
a touching appeal to the General of his Order, and his letter
appeared in the <i>Correspondance de Rome</i> (June 11, 1870). The
Franco-Prussian War, however, absorbed all thoughts in Europe, and
the publication fell still-born from the Press.</p>

<p>"Fray Emanuel relates in his letter that one day, when visiting
the Neophytes before their imprisonment&mdash;he modestly passes over
the important part which he had taken in receiving them&mdash;he asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
them if they could answer for their constancy. The reply was: 'We
believe not simply through your teachings of the Word, and through
our reading the religious books which you gave us, but because the
Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to visit us and to enlighten us
Himself, whilst the Blessed Virgin has done likewise!' adding, 'How
could we without such a miracle have so easily become Christians?'
The good priest would not express his doubts, for fear of 'offending
one of these little ones.' He felt an ardent desire to inquire into
the visions and the revelations to which they alluded. But he did
not neglect to take the necessary precautions. Assembling his
brethren, and presiding himself, he began with the unfortunate Salih,
and he examined and cross-questioned the converts separately. He
found them unanimous in declaring that on the first night when they
witnessed an apparition, they had prayed for many hours, and that
slumber had overcome them, when the Saviour Jesus Christ appeared
to them one by one. Being dazzled by the light, they were very
much afraid; but one of them, taking courage, said, 'Lord, may
I speak?' He answered, 'Speak.' They asked, 'Who art Thou,
Lord?' The apparition replied, 'I am the Truth Whom thou
seekest. I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God.' Awakening agitated
and frightened, they looked one at the other, and one took courage
and spoke, the rest responding simply, 'I also saw Him.' Christ
had once more so consoled, comforted, and exhorted them to follow
His path, and they were filled with such ineffable joy, love, faith, and
gratitude, that, but for His admonishing them (as He used to
admonish the disciples), they could hardly restrain themselves from
rushing into the streets and from openly preaching the Gospel to the
Infidel City. On another occasion the Blessed Virgin stood before
them with the Child Jesus in her arms, and, pointing to Him, said
three times in a clear and distinct voice, 'My Son Jesus Christ,
Whom you see, is the Truth.' There are many other wonderful
revelations whose truth I can vouch for, but I feel a delicacy of
thrusting them before unbelievers. Indeed, I have kept back half
of what I know, and I am only giving the necessary matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="And_persecuted"></a>And persecuted.</i></div>

<p>"Of the fourteen Christian converts remanded to prison, two were
suffered to escape. The relations of Mohammad Dib and Marjan
bribed the authorities and succeeded in proving an alibi. Abd el
Karim Matar, the Chief of the Shádilis, who had been placed in
confinement under the suspicion of being a Christian, fell ill, and his
relations, by giving bribes and by offering bail, carried him off to his
native village, Darayya. There, as he was now bedridden, the family
gathered around him, crying, 'Istash'had!' That is to say, 'Renew
the faith (by bearing witness to Allah and his prophet Mohammad).'
The invalid refused, turning his face towards the wall whilst his
cruel relations struck and maltreated him. The cry was incessantly
repeated and so was the refusal. At last such violence was used that
the unfortunate Abd el Karim expired, the protomartyr of the
Revival.</p>

<p>"On the night of Ramazan 1, A.H. 1286 (December, A.D. 1869),
the 'twelve' (a curious coincidence that it was the number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
first Apostles in this very land) who remained in prison were secretly
sent ironed, <i>viâ</i> Beyrout, to the dungeons of Chanak Kalessi (the
Dardanelles fortress). Thence they were shipped off in a craft so
cranky and dangerous that they were wrecked twice, at Rhodes
and at Malta. At last they were landed at Tripoli in Barbary,
and they were finally exiled to the distant interior settlement of
Murzuk. Their wives and children, then numbering sixty-two, and
now fifty-three, were left at Damascus to starve in the streets, but
for the assistance of their fellow-converts and of the Terra Santa
Convent. It is a touching fact that if one of these poor converts
has anything, he will quickly go and sell it, and use the profit in
common, that all the brethren may have a little to eat. The Porte
is inexorable; even H.I.M. of Austria was, it is reported, unable to
procure the return of the exiles. Yet probably the 'Commander of
the Faithful,' Sultan Abdul Aziz, will ere long expect Austria, as well
as England and the rest of Western Europe, to fight his battles.</p>

<p>"I call upon the world that worships Christ to punish this high-handed
violation of treaty, this wicked banishment of innocent men.
Catholic and Protestant are in this case both equally interested.
The question at once concerns not only the twelve unfortunate exiles
and their starving families. It involves the grand principle of
religious toleration, which interests even the atheist and the infidel
throughout the Turkish Empire, throughout the Eastern world.</p>

<p>"Upon the answer depends whether Christianity shall be allowed
free growth and absolute development. Let England demand of the
Porte the removal of this Governor-General. Deliver us from this
modern Herod! Let Abdul Aziz call off his dog from worrying the
followers of Christ for the sake of the bones thrown to him by Aali
Pasha, his Grand Vizier. Send us an honest man, unlike Rashíd
Pasha, who will not dare to rend asunder the most solemn ties that
can bind nations, who will have the courage to do his duty.</p>

<p>"Amongst the Shádili converts was a private soldier of the Nizam
or Regulars, aged twenty-three, and bearing the highest character.
About five months after the movement commenced, the soldier Ahmed
el Sahhár being in barracks retired to a corner for prayer and meditation,
when suddenly our Saviour stood before him, and said, 'Dost
thou believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God? I am He.' The youth
at once replied, like the man blind from his birth, 'Lord, I believe.'
Jesus said to him, 'Thou shalt not always be a soldier; thou shalt
return free to thy home;' upon which Ahmed inquired, 'How can I
set myself free?' Jesus again said, 'I will deliver thee,' and with
these words the beatific vision disappeared.</p>

<p>"The young soldier had fallen into a state of ecstasy. Presently
he arose and passed through the barracks, exclaiming, 'Jesus Christ
is my God! Jesus Christ is my God!' His comrades were scandalized.
A crowd rushed up; some covered his mouth with their hands;
others filled it with dirt, and all dealt out freely blows and blasphemies.
At last it was decided that Ahmed had become possessed of a devil,
and, whilst he preserved perfect tranquillity, heavy chains were bound
upon his neck, his arms, and his legs. At that moment Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
again appeared to him, and said, 'Break that chain!' He said,
'How can I break it, it being of iron?' and again the voice spoke
louder, 'Break that chain!' He tore it asunder as though it had v
been of wax. A heavier chain was brought, and the same miracle
happened once more. This was reported to the officers, and by them
to their Bey or commandant; the latter sent for the private, and,
after heaping reproaches, abuse, and threats upon him, ordered him
to be imprisoned without food or water, and to be carefully fettered.
Still for a third and a fourth time the bonds fell off, and supernatural
graces and strength were renewed to the prisoner, who made
no attempt to move or to escape from his gaolers.</p>

<p>"The soldiers fled in fear, and the commandant no longer dared
to molest the convert. The case was represented to Constantinople,
and orders were sent that Ahmed must appear at the capital. He
was despatched accordingly under an escort, and with his wrists in a
block of wood acting as handcuffs. Reaching Diurat, a village three
hours from Damascus, he saw at night the door of his room fly open,
and the Blessed Virgin entering, broke with her own hands the
block of wood and his other bonds. By her orders he walked back
alone to Damascus and reported himself to his regiment. It was
determined this time to forward him with a party of soldiers, but
without chains or 'wood.'</p>

<p>"Arrived at Constantinople, the accused was brought before a
court-martial; a medical man was consulted as to his sanity, and
the prisoner was not a little surprised to find himself set at liberty,
and free to go where he pleased. Thus the promise of Jesus Christ
was fulfilled. The neophyte took the name of 'Isa,' which is Jesus,
and returned to Damascus, where his history became generally known.
The Turks pointed him out as the 'soldier who broke four chains.'
Some term him the 'Majnún,' the madman, though there is nothing
about him to indicate the slightest insanity; but most of the people
held him in the highest respect, calling him Shaykh Ahmed, and thus
raising him to the rank of 'Santon,' or saintly man.</p>

<p>"The terrible example of the Shádili families has not arrested the
movement&mdash;persecution never does. The blood of the martyrs is
still the seed of the Church. But the converts now conduct their
proceedings with more secrecy. They abstain from public gatherings,
although they occasionally visit Fray Dominic d'Avila, Padre
Guardiano, or Superior of the Terra Santa. The society has now
assumed a socialistic character, with private meetings for prayers,
and with the other precautions of a secret order. The number of
converts has greatly increased. At the end of 1869 the males in the
City of Damascus amounted to 500; in 1870 it had risen to 4100;
and in 1871 it represents 4900, of whom some 700 have been secretly
baptized. Moreover, I have been assured by the converts with whom
I associate and converse frequently, some of them being men highly
connected and better educated than their persecutors, that a small
tribe of freebooters living in and about the Druze mountain (Jebel
Druze Haurán), having been troubled and threatened by the local
Government, has split into two parties&mdash;Moslem and Christian, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
latter known by crosses hoisted upon their tent roofs. The converts
described to me the Bukâa (Cœlesyria) as a field in which the gospel
has lately borne fruit, and this was unexpectedly confirmed. The
peasantry of B&mdash;&mdash;, a little village on the eastern slope of the
Lebanon, and near Shtora, the central station of the French road,
lately became the property of a certain M. A&mdash;&mdash; T&mdash;&mdash;. He owned
two-thirds of the village, but by working the authorities he managed
to get into his hands the whole of the houses and fields, the crops
and cattle&mdash;in fact, all the village property. The wretches, after being
nearly starved for months, lately came up to Damascus, and begged
to be received as Christians. In early July it was whispered that the
Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Mgr. Valerga, is expected to meet, at
his summer residence in Beyrout, Mgr. Franchi, the Papal Envoy;
that both these prelates will visit Damascus, and that then these poor
souls will ask for baptism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Protestant_Converts"></a>The Protestant Converts.</i></div>

<p>"Protestantism has also had its triumphs. About ten months
ago a certain Hanifi Moslem, named Abd el Razzak, having some
misgivings about his faith, left his native city Baghdad in order to
visit the Bab or head of the Babi sect, who lies in the galleys of S.
Jean d'Acre&mdash;what a place for such a purpose! The interview not
being satisfactory, he travelled to Damascus, where he came under
Protestant influence. Thence he was removed to Shtora on the
French road, and finally to Suk el Gharb in the Maronite mountains.
There he was enabled to study, and he was publicly baptized under
the name of Abdallah. The Turkish authorities had no power over
him; but the second case did not end so well.</p>

<p>"A certain Hajj Hassan, a coachman in the service of a Christian
family at Beyrout, M. Joachim Najjar, began about 1869 to attend
the Protestant service, and for two months before his incarceration
he professed himself a Christian, although he had not been baptized.
He is described by all who know him as a simple and sincere man,
gifted with great strength of will. He was waylaid, beaten, and
finally cast with exceeding harshness into prison at Beyrout by the
Governor, Rauf Pasha, who replied to all representations that he
was unable to release him; he acted, in fact, under superior authority.
The convert was not allowed to see his family, and on Thursday,
June 29, he was sent in charge of a policeman to the Capital: this,
too, despite the remonstrances of the Consuls-General for the United
States and Prussia.</p>

<p>"The superintendent of the British Syrian school, where the
convert has a child, took the precaution of despatching to head-quarters
one of the employés, the Rev. Mr. Waldmeier, so that
energetic action began even before the arrival of Hajj Hassan.
Rashíd Pasha commenced by treating with contempt her Majesty's
Consul's strong appeals to his justice; he openly ignored the Treaty,
blaming me for not having quoted the actual article, and he
declined to permit the interference of strangers in the case of a
subject of H.I.M. the Sultan. He maintained that he had a
right to send for the Neophyte in order that the latter might be
'counselled;' and for that purpose he placed him under arrest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
the house of the most bigoted Moslem in Syria, the chief of police,
Mir Alai (Colonel) Mustafa Bey. He complained strongly of the
conduct of Protestant missionaries in Syria, accusing them of secretly
proselytizing, though he admitted in the same sentence that the
convert Hassan had openly attended a Christian church for
some time. On the next day he ungraciously refused my
request that the Presbyterian missionaries (Rev. Messrs. Wright,
Crawford, and Scott) might be allowed access to the Neophyte.
About midday on Friday, June 30, Rashíd Pasha sent for Hajj
Hassan, who had been duly disciplined by the police, and locking
the door, he began to ask whether the convert was not in fear of
being strangled&mdash;words which, in his mouth, had a peculiar significancy.
He then proceeded to offer a price for apostasy, which rose
to thirty thousand piastres. This was stoutly refused by the Neophyte,
who was returned to arrest. Presently the Governor-General
heard that I had telegraphed for permission to proceed to
Constantinople to represent to my Ambassador the state of things
in Syria within my district, and Hajj Hassan was ordered to
return under the charge of a policeman to Beyrout. The new
Christian, however, was warned that he must quit that port together
with his family within twenty days, under pain of being sent to
Constantinople handcuffed, or, as the native phrase is, 'in wood.'</p>

<p>"The case of Hajj Hassan came to a lame and impotent conclusion.
He had been delivered out of the Moslem stronghold,
Damascus, to the safe side of the Lebanon. The Protestant
Christians of Beyrout, with their schools, missions, and Consuls-General
to back them up, should have kept him at Beyrout, and
Rashíd Pasha should have been compelled either to eat his own
words or to carry out his threat. In the latter case the convert
should have been accompanied to Constantinople by a delegate from
the Missions, and the Sublime Porte should have been compelled to
decide whether she would or would not abide by her Treaties and
Firmans. The plea that exile was necessary to defend the convert
from his own co-religionists, that banishment was for his own benefit,
is simply absurd. Either the Porte can or she cannot protect her
Christian converts. In the latter case they must be protected for
her. Never probably has there been so good an opportunity for
testing Turkey's profession of liberalism, and the Turks are too
feeble and too cunning to let another present itself.</p>

<p>"In their first fright the Beyrout European Christians withdrew
their protection from Hajj Hassan. On the diligence arriving at
the 'Pines,' a forest about an hour before reaching Beyrout from
Damascus, the convert was ordered to dismount, and his wife and
five children (one at the breast) were turned adrift from the house
which had protected them for some days, at nine o'clock at night,
to wander whither they could. Hajj Hassan was subsequently
removed from Beyrout to Abeigh, an Anglo-American (U.S.) Mission
station in the Lebanon, probably by the exertions of Dr. Thomson,
author of 'The Land and the Book,' who distinguishes himself in
Beyrout by daring to have an opinion and to express it, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
unfortunately he stood alone and unsupported. On July 20th, Hajj
Hassan was to be shipped off by night to Alexandria, where he was
expected to 'find good employ.' Suddenly his passport was refused
by the local authorities, and he was hidden in the house of a
Consular Dragoman. The Porte had sent a secret despatch, ordering
him to be transported to Crete, Cyprus, or one of the islands in
the Archipelago, where his fate may easily be divined. At length a
telegram arrived from Constantinople, and the result was that, after
a fortnight's detention by sickness, Hajj Hassan was sent off by
the French mail of Friday, August 11th. Verily, the Beyroutines
are a feeble folk. They allowed themselves to be shamefully defeated
by Rashíd Pasha when he was grossly in the wrong.</p>

<p>"When the depositions of Hajj Hassan were taken at the Consulate,
Damascus, he declared that a Moslem friend of his, named
Hammud ibn Osman Bey, originally from Latakia (Laodicea), but
domiciled at Beyrout, had suddenly disappeared, and had not been
heard of for twelve days. Presently it became known that Hammud,
about two years ago, when in the employ of Mr. Grierson, then Vice-Consul
of Latakia, was drawn for the Army, but had not been called
upon to serve. He was in the habit of hearing the missionaries
preach, and on more than one occasion he declared that he would
profess Christianity&mdash;a course from which his friends dissuaded him.</p>

<p>"Hammud determined, in the beginning of 1871, to visit Beyrout,
and Mr. Grierson gave him letters of introduction to the missionaries
and to the superintendent of the British Syrian schools, requesting
that he might be taken into the service of some European family.
Here he again openly committed himself by declaring that he was
a Christian. His former master, knowing that the eyes of the police
were upon him, made immediate arrangements for his leaving by the
steamer to Latakia, where he had been recruited, giving him at the
same time a note for the colonel commanding the regiment. Hammud,
however, on the evening before his journey, imprudently walked
out in the direction of the barracks: he was seized and put in irons&mdash;probably
to be 'counselled.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Grierson, when informed of this arrest, at once addressed
Toufan Bey. This officer is a Pole commanding one of the
regiments of the 'Cossacks of the Sultan,' the other being quartered
at Adrianople. Visiting the Military Pasha of Beyrout, he begged
that as Hammud's passage had been taken for Latakia, where his
name had been drawn, the convert might be allowed to proceed
there. The two officers sent for the man and gave the required
directions respecting him. But Hammud was already in the
enemies' hands; and the normal charge of desertion was of course
trumped up against him. He was sent with a number of other
conscripts to the capital, with tied hands, and carrying the rations of
his fellow-soldiers; and presently a report was spread that he had
been put to death.</p>

<p>"Hajj Hassan on returning to Beyrout informed Mr. Johnson,
Consul-General for the United States, that during his arrest at
Damascus the soldiers had threatened to 'serve him as they had served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
Hammudeh.' He went at once to Rauf Pasha, who replied that
the man had been arrested and sent to head-quarters because he had
been conscripted two years before at Latakia and had deserted.
This was directly opposed to the statement made by Mr. Grierson,
namely, that the man had never been called upon to serve. Mr.
Johnson could do no more, as Hammud had made himself amenable
to the law of the land, and he seems not to have taken any steps to
decide whether it was a <i>bonâ-fide</i> desertion. He inquired, however,
what the punishment would be, and was told that it would
depend upon circumstances.</p>

<p>"Several people at Beyrout wrote to me at Damascus, begging of
me to institute a search for the missing man. Shortly afterwards
letters were despatched from Beyrout, stating that Hammud had
been found in the barracks alive and well, and contented with his
condition as a soldier. What process he has been through to effect
such a wonderful change we are not informed, nor where he has been
hidden during its operation. The 'counselling' has probably compelled
the convert by brute force to conceal his convictions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Shadilis"></a>The Shádilis.</i></div>

<p>"Another story in the mouths of men is that a young man, the
son of a <i>kázi</i> or judge, had lately suffered martyrdom at Damascus
for the crime of becoming a Christian. This may possibly be a
certain Said el Hamawi, who disappeared three or four years ago.
Said was a man of education, and a Shaykh, who acted <i>khatíb</i> (or
scribe and chaplain) to one of the regiments. He was convicted of
having professed Christianity, and was sent for confinement to the
Capital. When let out of prison he repeated his offence, and he has
never been heard of since.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the Saturday (July 1) which witnessed the
unjust sentence of exile pronounced upon Hajj Hassan, a certain
Arif Effendi ibn Abd el Ghani el Nablusi was found hanging in a
retired room of the Great Amáwi Mosque at Damascus, where he
had been imprisoned. No inquest was held upon the body, which
may or may not have shown signs of violence; it was hastily buried.
Some three years before this time, Arif Effendi, a man of high family,
and of excellent education, had become a Greek Christian at Athens,
under the name of Eustathius. Presently he reappeared in Syria as
a convert, a criminal whom every good&mdash;that is to say, bigoted&mdash;Moslem
deems worthy of instant and violent death. He came to
the Capital, and he introduced himself as a Christian to the Irish-American
Presbyterian missionaries; to Monseigneur Yakub, the
Syrian Catholic Bishop, and to others; nor did he conceal from
them his personal fears. He expected momentary destruction, and
presently he found it, being accused, truthfully or not I am unable to
say, of stealing fourteen silver lamp-chains, and a silver padlock. The
wildest rumours flew about the City. The few declared that the man
had hanged himself. The Nablusi family asserted that, repenting
his apostasy, he had allowed himself to be hanged, and the vulgar
were taught to think that he was hanged by order of Sayyidna Yahya,
our Lord John (the Baptist), whose head is supposed to be buried
in the Great Mosque. It was currently reported that the renegade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
had been sent to the Algerine Amir, the Sayyid Abd el Kadir, who,
finding him guilty of theft, had ordered him to receive forty stripes and
to be arrested in the Mosque, at the same time positively refusing to
sanction his execution as his accusers demanded. This proceeding,
though irregular, is not contrary to Moslem law; the Ulemá claim
and are allowed such jurisdiction in matters concerning the Mosque.</p>

<p>"I, suspecting foul play, applied on the 3rd of July for information
upon this subject to the <i>Wali</i>, who rudely refused to 'justify himself.'
Eight days afterwards the Governor-General thought proper
to lay the case before the Tribunal. The result may easily be
imagined. That honourable body cast the blame of the illegal
imprisonment upon the Amir Abd el Kadir, whom they hate because
he saved so many Christian lives in 1860. They delivered a verdict
that the convert had been found hanged by his own hand, they
antedated a medical certificate that the body bore no marks of
violence, and they asserted contrary to fact and truth that the
deceased was decently washed and buried, whereas he was thrust
into a hole like a dog.</p>

<p>"And now I will answer the question prominent in every reader's
mind: 'These men are Turks; are we bound to protect them?'</p>

<p>"I simply reply we are.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_quotes_Mr_Gladstone"></a>Richard quotes Mr. Gladstone.</i></div>

<p>"It is obviously our national duty to take serious action in arresting
such displays of Moslem fanaticism as those that have lately taken
place in Syria. Mr. Gladstone cannot forget his own words: 'We
would be sorry not to treat Turkey with the respect due to a Power
which is responsible for the government of an extended territory, but
with reference to many of her provinces and their general concerns,
circumstances place her in such a position that we are entitled and,
indeed, in many cases, bound to entertain questions affecting her
internal relations to her people, such as it would be impertinent to
entertain in respect to most foreign countries.... All that we can
expect is that when she has contracted legal or moral engagements
she should fulfil them, and that when she is under no engagements
she should lend a willing ear to counsels which may be in themselves
judicious, and which aim solely at the promotion of her interests....
As regards the justice of the case, we must remember that as far
as regards the stipulations of the Hatti-i-Humaioun, we are not only
entitled to advise Turkey in her own interest, in her regard to
humanity, in her sense of justice, in her desire to be a civilized
European Power, to fulfil those engagements, but we are also
entitled to say to her that the fulfilment of those stipulations is a
matter of moral faith, an obligation to which she is absolutely bound,
and the disregard of which will entail upon her disgrace in the eyes
of Europe.... We are entitled to require from Turkey the execution
of her literal engagements' (Debate on Crete and Servia. Mr.
Gregory's motion for correspondence and Consular Reports on the
Cretan Insurrection, etc., as reported in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of Feb.
15-18, 1867).</p>

<p>"These memorable words deserve quotation the more, as throughout
the nearer East, especially among the Christian communities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
England still suffers under the imputation of not allowing the
interests of Christendom to weigh against her politics and her sympathy
with the integrity of the Turkish Empire. Even if we care
little for the propagation of Christianity, or for the regeneration of
Asia, we are bound to see that treaties do not become waste paper.</p>

<p>"The first step to be taken in North Syria, and to be taken without
delay, would be to procure the recall and the pardon of the
twelve unfortunates who were banished in 1870 to Tripoli of Barbary,
and to Murzuk in Inner Africa. This will be a delicate proceeding;
imprudently carried out, it will inevitably cost the lives of men whose
only offence has been that of becoming Christians, and it will only
serve to sink their families into still deeper misery. But there should
be no difficulty of success. Our Consul-General at Tripoli could
easily defend the lives if not the liberties of the Neophytes. Her
Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at Constantinople
should be directed firmly to demand that an officer of
high rank be sent from Head-quarters, and that he should be made
duly responsible for landing the exiles in safety at Beyrout. Thence
they should be transferred to Damascus; their pretended offences
should be submitted to a regular tribunal, whose action would be
watched by me or my successor, and when publicly proved to be
innocent these men should be restored to the bosoms of their
families, whilst the police should be especially charged with their
safety.</p>

<p>"This step taken, the next will naturally be to urge the instant
recall of the unjust <i>Wali</i>, or Governor-General, of Syria, Mohammed
Rashíd Pasha, together with those members of the Secret Tribunal,
more especially the Mufattish Effendi, Mahommad Izzat, who made
themselves his instruments in carrying out illegal and tyrannical
measures against a body of twelve innocent men. And when the
head and front of the evil shall have been removed and the limbs
formally impeached, a consummation devoutly to be desired, unless
due prudence be exercised much evil may be the result. Rashíd
Pasha has filled every important post with his familiars and creatures;
he will doubtless leave directions after his departure for all manner
of troubles to be excited, especially between Christians and Moslems,
Greeks and Latins, in order to stifle the outcry which will rise from
the length and breadth of the land. The remedy will be a High
Commissioner, and a Firman from Constantinople couched in the
strongest terms, and holding all Governors and Judges (<i>muftis</i> and
<i>kázis</i>) personally responsible for any disorderly proceedings. And
should they not be able to keep the peace, should any threat of repeating
the horrors of 1860 be heard, the nations of Europe must
prepare to keep it for them.</p>

<p>"Thus will the unhappy province&mdash;a land once flowing with milk
and honey, now steeped to the lips in poverty and crime&mdash;recover
from the misery and the semi-starvation under which it has groaned
during the last five years. Thus also Christianity may again raise
her head in her birthplace and in the land of her early increase.
Thus shall England become to Syria, and through Syria to Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
Asia, the blessing which Syria in the days of the early Church was to
England, to Europe, and to the civilized world. Let her discharge
her obligations before her God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Letters_approving_his_Conduct"></a>Letters approving his Conduct.</i></div>

<p>I saw at the Mission in Damascus, and obtained leave to copy,
the following testimonial addressed to Richard, and his reply.&mdash;I. B.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Damascus, July 12, 1871.</p>

<p>"To Captain Burton, H.B.M.'s Consul at Damascus.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;We beg to tender to you our heartiest thanks for your
prompt decisive action in the case of Hassan the converted Moslem,
and also to congratulate you on the result of your determination and
firmness.</p>

<p>"For some time past we had heard that a Moslem converted to
Protestantism at Beyrout had become subject to considerable persecution.
A convert more obscure than himself has been put out of
the way and has not since been heard of, and Hassan had been subjected
to a series of arrests and imprisonments, and had several times
narrowly escaped assassination. The chief Consulates, however,
had become publicly interested in him, so that his safety from legal
execution seemed ensured; and as he was always accompanied by
some one to protect him from assassins, he seemed for the time to
be safe. But on the 29th of June we were surprised to find that he
was being transported to Damascus, having been arrested and bound
in chains. The English colony in Beyrout became alarmed, as they
declared that none so transported to Damascus ever returned again.
Two agents of the Mission were despatched from Beyrout, one preceding
the prisoner to give us information as to what had taken
place, and the other accompanying the prisoner to watch what
became of him. On receiving intelligence of the convert's transportation
to this City, the missionaries of the three Missions at
Damascus resolved to lay the case before you, but on doing so found
that you had with your usual energy already taken up the case, and
categorically demanded the release of the prisoners. And though
the authorities ignored the Firman granting civil and religious liberty
to the people of this Empire, and denied your right to interfere on
behalf of the prisoner, the unflinching stand you took by the concessions
of the Hatti-Sheríf secured the release of the prisoner: you
have thus vindicated the cause of humanity, for on the day on which
the prisoner escaped through your intervention, the Moslem authorities
strangled in the Great Mosque of Damascus a Moslem convert
to Christianity. The man had made application to the Irish
American Mission for protection, and declared that he lived in daily
fear of strangulation. He was imprisoned in the Great Mosque,
and strangled as they say by St. John the Baptist, and then carried
away by one man and thrown into a hole like a dog.</p>

<p>"This accident proves that your uncompromising firmness with
the authorities was an act of pure mercy, and that the worst apprehensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
of the Beyrout missionaries were not unfounded. But
more important still, you have asserted the binding character of the
spiritual privileges of the Christian subjects of the Porte, contained
in the Firman of 1856, and which, according to Fuad Pasha's letters
to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, comprises 'absolutely all proselytes.'</p>

<p>"We are sure, Sir, that your conduct in this affair will receive the
unqualified approbation of the best public opinion in Christendom,
and we have no doubt it will receive, as it merits, the warm approval
of your own Government.</p>

<p>"We who were near and anxious spectators of the proceedings in
this affair cannot too warmly express our sense of the satisfaction
with which we witnessed the fearless, firm, and efficient manner in
which you conducted this important case until the convert was permitted
to leave this city.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Beludan, July 19, 1871.</p>

<p>"I have the pleasure to return my warmest thanks for your letter
this day received, in which you have formed so flattering an estimate
of my services as H.M.'s Consul for Damascus. Nor must I
forget to express my gratitude to you for the cordial support and
approval of my proceedings connected with your Missions which
you have always extended to me. This friendly feeling has greatly
helped to lighten the difficulties of the task that lay before me
in 1869. You all know, and none can better know, what was
to be done when I assumed charge of this Consulate; you are
acquainted with the several measures taken by me, honourably I
hope to our national name, and you are familiar with the obstacles
thrown in my way, and with the manner in which I met them. My
task will encounter difficulties for some time. Still the prospect
does not deter me. I shall continue to maintain the honest independence
of H.M.'s Consulate, to defend our rights as foreigners in
Syria, and to claim all our privileges to the letter of the law. Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
I meet&mdash;and there is no fear of its being otherwise&mdash;the approval of
my Chiefs, who know that an official life of twenty-nine years in the
four quarters of the world is a title to some confidence, I feel
assured that we may look forward to happier times at Damascus, when
peace and security shall take the place of anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I recommend to your prudent consideration the
present state of affairs in Syria. A movement which I cannot but
characterize as a Revival of Christianity, seems to have resulted
from the peculiar action of the authorities, and from the spirit of
inquiry awakened in the hearts of the people. It numbers its converts
by thousands, including men of high rank, and it is progressing
even amongst the soldiery.</p>

<p>"I need hardly observe that it is the duty of one and all of us to
labour in the grand cause of religious toleration, and to be watchful
lest local and personal interpretations are allowed to misrepresent
the absolute rights of all converts to life and liberty. And I trust
that you will find me, at the end as in the beginning, always ready
to serve your interests, to protect your Missions and Schools, and to
lend my most energetic aid to your converts.</p>

<p>"I am, with truth and regard, yours faithfully,</p>

<p>"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Richard Burton</span>,</p>

<p>"H.M.'s Consul, Damascus."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the time that Richard was nearest making a public
declaration of Catholicity, but it was his "recall." I cannot tell it
better than in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I took the part, and espoused the cause of these forty martyrs,
and wrote home offering to be security for them if the Latin
Patriarch Valerga might be sent down to baptize them. I promised
to stand guard, and my wife would be godmother to them all. I
asked her if she were afraid, and she said, 'Afraid! No, indeed,
only too proud.' Lord Granville wrote to inquire into the matter,
and the reply was, 'that Valerga would not come, that the matter
was very much exaggerated, that there were only four hundred.' I
have copies of the letter now. Then my seven enemies clubbed
together, and represented most falsely that my life was in danger,
that I was very unpopular with the Moslems, which only meant the
corrupt Rashíd Pasha."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Granville, like many another easy-going, pleasant diplomat
(to please God knows who), ruined the life of the best man under his
rule with the stroke of his pen. That <i>did</i> put the whole of Syria in a
blaze of revolt and indignation, and it required the utmost prudence
not to put a match to it. It is a pitiful tale, and was a revolting sight
to see seven jackals trying to rend an insulted and martyred lion.</p>

<p>One fine day a bombshell fell in the midst of our happy life. It
was not <i>only</i> the insult of the whole thing, it was the ungentlemanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
way in which it was carried out from Beyrout. This was our position
and the way it was done:&mdash;</p>

<p>We were surrounded by hundreds who seemed to be dependent
upon us; by villages which, under our care, consular or maternal,
seemed to be thriving, prosperous, peaceful, and secure; by friends
we had made everywhere. Our lives, plans, and interests were
arranged for years; we were settled down and established as securely,
we thought, as any of you in your own houses at home. Our
<i>entourage</i> was a large one&mdash;dragomans, <i>kawwáses</i>, servants; our stud,
various pets, and flowers; our home, and our "household gods;" our
poor for thirty miles around us. And so surrounded, our only wish was
to stay, perhaps for life, and do our duty both to God and our neighbour;
and we were succeeding, as I mean to prove. You, through
whose evil working the blow struck us on this day, examine your
hearts, and ask yourselves why you did this thing, because God, who
protects those who serve Him, will allow this cruel deed to follow
you, and recoil upon you some day, when you least expect it. It
was useless to mislead the Authorities and the public at home, by
laying the blame upon the Moslems. Richard always has been a
very good friend to the Moslems, and the Moslems have always liked
him; but in this instance, local and individual weakness, spite and
jealousy, overthrew him.</p>

<p>The horses were saddled at the door, in the Anti-Lebanon, and we
were going for a ride, when a ragged messenger on foot stopped to
drink at the spring, and advanced towards me with a note. I saw it
was for Richard, and took it into the house for him. It was from
the Vice-Consul of Beyrout, informing him that, by the orders of his
Consul-General, he had arrived the previous day (15th of August),
and had taken charge of the Damascus Consulate. The Vice-Consul
was in no way to blame.<a name="FNanchor_1_173" id="FNanchor_1_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_173" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Richard's journal says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>August</i> 16<i>th.</i>&mdash;All ready to start&mdash;rode in.</p>

<p>"<i>August</i> 18<i>th.</i>&mdash;Left Damascus for ever; started at three a.m. in
the dark, with a big lantern; all my men crying; alone in <i>coupé</i> of
diligence, thanks to the pigs. Excitement of seeing all for the last
time. All seemed sorry; a few groans. The sight of Bludán mountains
in the distance at sunrise, where I have left my wife. <i>Ever
again?</i> Felt soft. Dismissal ignominious, at the age of fifty, without
a month's notice, or wages, or character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Turkish Government has boasted that it would choose its
own time, when Moslems may become Christians if they wish. The
time has now come."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_leaves"></a>He leaves.</i></div>

<p>Richard and Charley Tyrwhitt-Drake were in the saddle in five
minutes, and galloped into town without drawing rein. He would
not let me accompany him. A mounted messenger returned on the
19th with these few written words, "Don't be frightened; I am
recalled. Pay, pack, and follow at convenience." I was not
frightened, but I do not like to remember what I thought or felt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_take_a_Night_Ride_across_Country"></a>I take a Night Ride across Country.</i></div>

<p>I could not rest on the night of the 19th; I thought I heard some
one call me three successive times. I jumped up in the middle of a
dark night, saddled my horse, and, though everybody said I was mad,
and wanted to put me to bed, I rode a journey of nine hours across
country, by the compass, as if I were riding for a doctor, over rocks and
through swamps, making for the diligence halfway house. Three or
four of my people were frightened, and followed me. At last I came
in sight of Shtora, the diligence-station. The half-hour had expired;
the travellers had eaten and taken their places, and it was just about
to start; but God was good to me. Just as the coachman was about
to raise his whip, he turned his head to the part of the country from
whence I was coming, hot, torn, and covered with dust and mud
from head to foot; but he knew me. I held up both my arms, as
they do to stop a train. He saw the signal, waited, and took me
in, and told the ostler to lead my dead-beat horse to the stables.<a name="FNanchor_2_174" id="FNanchor_2_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_174" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>I reached Beyrout twenty-four hours before the steamer sailed.
When Richard had once received his recall, he never looked behind
him, nor packed up anything, but went straight away. It is his rule
to be ready in ten minutes to go anywhere. He was now a private
individual in misfortune. I passed him in the diligence, walking
alone in the town, and looking so sad and serious. Not even a
<i>kawwás</i> was sent to attend on him, to see him out with a show of
honour and respect. It was a real emblem of the sick lion. But
<i>I</i> was there (thank God) in my place, and he was so surprised and
glad when he saw me! I was well rewarded for my hard ride, for
when he saw me his whole face was illuminated, and he said, "Thank
you, <i>bon sang ne peut mentir</i>." We had twenty-four hours to take
counsel and comfort together.</p>

<p>Everybody called upon us, and everybody regretted. The French
Consul-General made us almost take up our abode with him for
those twenty-four hours&mdash;our own Consul-General cut us. At four
o'clock I went on board with my husband, and on return I found his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
faithful servant Habíb, who had also followed him, and arrived just
ten minutes too late&mdash;only in time to see him steam out; he had
flung himself down on the quay in a passionate flood of tears.</p>

<p>Any Consul, in any part of the Eastern world, with one drop of
gentlemanly feeling, would have gone to meet his comrade in distress,
and sent a couple of <i>kawwáses</i> to walk before and behind
him. Mr. Eldridge's action was as big a thing as if he had posted
handbills all over Beyrout to announce to the world that no notice
was to be taken of him. The disgrace was to himself, not to Richard.<a name="FNanchor_3_175" id="FNanchor_3_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_175" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The only notice Richard took of <i>this</i> tragedy in his life is one
sentence in his journal: "After all my service, ignominiously dismissed,
at fifty years of age"&mdash;and at whose instance, do you think?
(1) A Pasha so corrupt that his own Government was obliged to
recall him a month later, threaten him with chains, and throw him
into a fortress, and his brains were blown out a short while after
by a man he had oppressed. (2) His own Consul-General, whose
memory is only known to his once immediate acquaintances by the
careful registering of his barometers, and the amount of beer which
helped that arduous task, and who exactly suited the Foreign Office
by confining himself to so narrow a circle. He was fearfully jealous
of his superior subordinate, and asked for his removal through Mr.
Kennedy, who was not commissioned for that business. Mr. Eldridge
said afterwards, "If Burton had only have walked in <i>my</i> way, he
would have lived and died here." Thirdly, an aggressive schoolmistress,
who altered, or <i>allowed to be altered</i>, some words in a letter
he wrote her, changing "mining" into "missionary," to be shown
at Exeter Hall. Fourthly, fifthly, and sixthly, three unscrupulous
Jewish usurers. Seventhly, an elastic Greek Bishop, who began a
crusade against the Protestants of Nazareth, and prevented them
from cultivating their land, and who had snatched away a synagogue
and cemetery from British-protected Jews.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_were_stoned_at_Nazareth"></a>We were stoned at Nazareth.</i></div>

<p>When we were in camp there, he caused his people, who were
about a hundred and fifty against six, to pick a quarrel with our
people, and they stoned us. "Stoning" in the East means a hailstorm
the size of melons, which positively seems to darken the air.
As an old soldier accustomed to fire, Richard stood perfectly calm,
collected, and self-contained, though the stones hit him right and left,
and almost broke his sword-arm; he never lost his temper, and never
fired, but was simply marking the ringleaders to take them. I ran out
to give him his two six-shot revolvers, but when I got within stones'
reach, he made a sign to me not to embarrass his movements; so I
kept near enough to drag him out if he were wounded, putting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
revolvers in my belt. When three of his servants were badly hurt, and
one lay for dead on the ground, he drew a pistol from a man's belt,
and fired a shot in the air. That was my signal. I flew round to the
other camps, and called all the English and Americans with their
guns. When they saw a reinforcement of ten armed English and
Americans running down upon them, the cowardly crew turned
and fled. This was followed by a <i>procès-verbal</i> between Richard and
the Bishop, which Richard won.</p>

<p>I was left to pack, pay, and follow; so I took the night diligence
back, and had, in spite of the August weather, a cold, hard seven
hours over the Lebanon, for I had brought nothing with me; my
clothes were dry and stiff, and I was very tired. On the road I
passed our honorary dragoman, Hanna Misk. I called out to him,
but I had no official position now, so he turned his head the other
way, and passed me by. I sent a peasant after him, but he shook
his head and rode on. "There," I said, "goes the man who has
lived with us, travelled with us, and shared everything we had, and
for whose rights concerning a village my husband has always contended,
because his claims were just." The law of "Le Roi est
mort, vive le Roi!" extends, I suppose, everywhere; but probably
the king's widow always feels it.<a name="FNanchor_4_176" id="FNanchor_4_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_176" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I wonder how old one has to
grow before learning the common rules of life, instead of allowing
every shock the world gives one to disturb one, as if one were newly
born? It is innate in cool natures, and never learnt by the others,
who take useless "headers" against the dead wall of circumstances,
until they grow old and cold and selfish. Disraeli told us that "no
affections and a great brain form the men that command the world;
that no affections and a little brain make petty villains;" but a great
brain and a great heart he has no description for. Here he stops
short; but I can tell him those are the men for whom there is no
place. The nineteenth century will have none of them.</p>

<p>Richard was a general favourite, but he was too powerful to suit
the Turkish <i>Wali</i>, or Governor-General, who for once found a man
he could not corrupt. To give some idea of <i>how</i> incorruptible, he
was once offered £10,000 on the table, which the man in question
brought with him, to give an opinion which would have swayed a
public transaction, which would have been no very great harm, but
yet it would not have been quite "square" for such a man as
Richard, and a promise of £10,000 when the thing was done&mdash;"for,"
said the man, "I can get plenty of money when I like, and
this will pay me well." My husband let him finish, and then he
said, "If you were a gentleman of my own standing, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
Englishman, I would just pitch you out of the window; but as
you are not, you may pick up your £10,000 and you may walk
down the stairs. But don't come here again, because if the thing is
right, I shall do it without your paying me; and if it is not, there is
not enough money in the world to buy me." He then called me,
and he told me about it, and said, "This man's harem will be offering
you diamonds; mind you don't take them." "There is not the
slightest chance," I said; "I don't want them." Now, it is a perfect
fact that, although I am a woman, jewellery is no temptation to me;
I therefore take no credit to myself that I have refused enough to
enable me to wear as many as any woman in London; but when
they brought me horses, it was quite another sensation, and I had
to screw up my courage hard&mdash;and bolt.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that Richard is the only man not born a Moslem
and an Oriental who, having performed the Hajj to Mecca and
Medinah, could live with the Moslems in perfect friendship after.
They considered him a <i>personâ grata</i>&mdash;something more civilized
than the common run of Franks; they called him Haji Abdullah,
and treated him as one of themselves. During Richard's time in
Syria he raised the English name, which was going down rapidly,
to its old prestige in the time of Sir Richard Wood and Lord Strathnairn,
and the old days of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. He explored
all the unknown parts of Syria, Palestine, Holy Land, Haurán, the
'Aláh and Nejd; he stood between the poor peasantry and the
usurers; he advanced and protected the just claims of British subjects.
When a massacre appeared imminent he kept the peace.
The fanatical persecution of the Christians was stopped; he stood
between them and his friends the Mohammedans; he said, "They
are mine, and you must not touch them;" he saved innumerable
villages from slavery. In fact, he was just the man whom Rashíd
Pasha, the corrupt Turkish Governor-General, could not stand; he
was an avenging angel in his way. His own Consul-General was
jealous of him. The Beyrout missionaries, or <i>rather</i> the British Syrian
schools missionaries&mdash;for we were friends with several Beyrout
missionaries, notably Dr. Thomson and Dr. Bliss&mdash;poisoned Exeter
Hall against him, although they got more help from him than from
any one, simply because neither he nor I were, what I believe the technical
term is, "practical Protestants." The three foremost Jews set
Sir Moses Montefiore and the illustrious Jewish families of London
against him, because he could not stand by and see the poor plundered
twice and thrice over, never getting a receipt for their money,
never being allowed a paper to show what they had paid, till (when
England is paying millions to suppress Slave-trade in various parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
of the world) she was unconsciously abetting it, and aiding it, and
protecting it, all over the Syrian villages, by the power of complaisant
Consuls. The Greek Bishop abetted our being stoned at
Nazareth, because he had advanced and protected the Protestant
missionaries' just claim in his jurisdiction. These seven hornets
were sufficient to kill and break the heart of St. Michael the archangel.
They say three hornets kill a man, and six will kill a horse.</p>

<p>I am now going to suppose that <i>all</i> my readers are not familiar
with Syria and its Cities, its native and foreign officials, or its various
Religions and Races. As a wanderer in that land, now free and
independent of all employments and Governments, an impartial
looker-on and a student of its politics, religions, and peculiar mode
of Government, I will diverge for a moment from my subject to
explain a few facts.</p>

<p>On arriving in Syria, one lands at Beyrout, a pretty town of no
very great importance to the world. It is the concentration of all
that Syria knows of comfort, luxury, and pleasure. Christian and
semi-civilized, it has its soldiers and policemen, its ships and sailors
under the windows, its semi-European mode of living and manners,
and its free communication with Europe by telegraphs and regular
mails. Steamers anchor in the open roadstead (there is no harbour,
pier, or landing-place, save a few broken unclean steps leading to a
small, dirty custom-house quay), an occasional merchant-ship appears,
and at times some wandering man-of-war. It is ruled by a Governor
subject to the <i>Wali</i>, who rules Syria, being in fact Viceroy to the
Sultan. This great official lives at Damascus, and visits Beyrout for
sea-bathing and to make holiday. It is also the residence of the
Consuls-General, who represent foreign Powers and European influence,
and are very great people in their way; and also of a large
European society of the middle classes. Beyrout is backed by the
high range of the Lebanon, which is inhabited by Druzes and
Maronites, and ruled by a separate Governor, Franco Pasha, an able
officer, independent of the <i>Wali</i>. After crossing the Lebanon and
descending into the plain of the Bukâa (Cœle-Syria) Civilization,
Christianity, and all free communication with the outer world, are
left behind; as are comforts, luxuries, and Society, whilst the traveller
is completely at the mercy of Beyrout as to how much or how little
he may receive of the necessary help such as man should give to his
fellow-man. For safety he is self-dependent on his own personal
courage and his knowledge of the East, and woe betide the hapless
one who has no friend at Beyrout, or whose Consul-General may
be a little sick, or selfish, or ill-tempered, or otherwise ill-disposed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
He steps forth into the solemnity of Orientalism, which increases
upon him during the sometimes dreary and barren seventy-two
miles journey, and he finds himself in the heart of Oriental life in
the City of Damascus. This Orientalism is the great charm of "the
Pearl of the East." She is still pure and innocent of anything like
Europeanism. However much the wanderer may dislike it at first,
the life so grows upon him that, after a time, to quit it would be a
wrench. But this is what makes the demi-semi-fashionable of Beyrout
hate Damascus, with a spice of fear, knowing nothing of her
attractions; whilst she, on her side, lazily despises the effeminate
and, to her, luxurious and feeble Beyroutine. Damascus, I have
said, is the heart and capital of Syria, the residence of the <i>Wali</i> and
his <i>entourage</i>, who rule Syria, who fear the strong and who oppress
the weak, who persecute Christians, who starve the people, and who
fill their own pockets. If his Excellency died to-morrow the voice
of Syria would go up to heaven in one loud cry of execration,
embodying the popular curse upon a departed tyrant's soul, "May
the Lord have no mercy upon your resting-place!" Here also are
the head-quarters of the Army and Police, the chief <i>Majlises</i> or
Tribunals, which represent our Courts of Law; business institutions
and transactions have also their place in Damascus, and, being a
"Holy City," I need not say that it is the religious <i>chef lieu</i>.</p>

<p>Syria has always been cursed with races, tribes, and faiths enough
to split up the country, and to cause all manner of confusion. For
instance, the Moslem is the national religion. There are the Moslem
Sunnites, or orthodox of four schools, viz. the Hanifi, Shafí, Hanbeli,
Maliki; the Shí'ah heresy, locally called Metáwali (of these most are
Kurds); the Nusayri (also Shiites), but their faith is little understood.
The Nowar, or Gypsies, are self-styled Mohammedans. Besides
these there are Shádilis or Sházlis (Dervishes and Sufis), Persian
"Babis," Chaldean Yezidis, Ismailiyehs (Shí'ahs) from different parts
of the East, and Wáhhabis, who keep themselves in the background.
The Bedawi, who are as the sands of the desert they inhabit, are
also Moslems.</p>

<p>After the Moslems, but conforming with them, come the Druzes,
who are divided into Akkal and Juhhal; which simply means "the
wise men" and "the foolish (young) men," as the former lead a
more rigid life than the latter. Their belief is more or less a
mystery; for policy's sake they affect the national religion, and they
will lean towards the faith of whatever person they may happen to
address.</p>

<p>The Jews are divided into Sephardim, Askenazim, Samaritan,
and Karaite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we come to the Christians, who number fourteen sects&mdash;Maronite
(Catholic), Greek Catholic, Greek Schismatic (styled
"orthodox"), Armenian Catholic, Armenian Schismatic (styled
"orthodox"), Syrian Catholic; Jacobite, which is Syrian "orthodox"
or non-Catholic, Latin Catholics (like the French, etc.), a few Protestants
(from the missions and schools of England, Chaldea, Prussia,
and the United States, and their converts), Copts, Abyssinians,
Chaldean Catholic and Chaldean Schismatics (styled "orthodox").
The Catholic rites have each a liturgy different from the Latin
Catholic Mass, and said in their own language; they communicate
under both kinds, but there is no heresy in their belief. A French
Catholic satisfies his obligations of hearing Mass on Sunday with them,
but of course he cannot receive their communion under both forms.</p>

<p>Nineteen Europeans reside at Damascus. This is the residence
of the Consuls, whose districts extend to Baghdad on the east, and
to Nablus on the south, and who have all the real work to do.
Some suppose that they are subject to the Consulates-General at
Beyrout, but this, though the Turks desire it, is highly unadvisable,
as Damascus work requires prompt and decided action and no loss
of time; moreover, any order which might apply to Beyrout would
be totally inapplicable at Damascus; finally, in nine cases out of
ten it would proceed from the advice of a dragoman interested in
the case, his superior not knowing Arabic, or perhaps never having
seen Damascus.</p>

<p>Upon the English Consul devolves the responsibility of the post
for Baghdad, and the protection of commerce, of travellers, and of
some half-dozen English residents. There are, besides the Consular
corps, four missions each with its school, three European religious
houses (Lazarists, Franciscans, and Sisters of Charity), an English
engineer, a French sanitary officer under his own Government, and,
lastly, the <i>employés</i> of the French Road Company.</p>

<p>Whoever lives in Damascus must have good health and nerves,
must be charmed with Oriental life, and must not care for society,
comforts, or luxuries, but be totally occupied with some serious
pursuit. Should he be a Consul&mdash;an old soldier is best&mdash;he must
be accustomed to command a strong hand. The natives must be
impressed by him, and know that, if attacked, he can fight. He
must be able to ride hard and to rough it in mountain or desert, in
order to attend to his own work, instead of sending a dragoman or
a <i>kawwás</i>, who probably would not really go, or if he did might be
bribed. He must have the honour and dignity of England truly at
heart, and he should be a gentleman to understand fully what this
means; not a man risen from the ranks, and liable to be "bullied or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
bribed." He should speak Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, as well as
English, French, and Italian, so as not to take the hearsay of his
dragomans. He must be able to converse freely with Arabs, Turks,
Bedawi, Druzes, Kurds, Jews, Maronites, Afghans, and Persians,
and understand their religious prejudices. He must have his reliable
men everywhere, and know everything that goes on throughout
the length and breadth of the country. He should have a thorough
knowledge of Eastern character. He must keep a hospitable house.
He should be cool, firm, and incorruptible. He must not be afraid
to do his duty, however unpleasant and risky, and having done it, if
his Chiefs do not back him up, <i>i.e.</i> his Consul-General, his Ambassador,
and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Turkish
local authorities know he has done his duty at his own risk; they
admire and they fear the individual, but they despise his Government
whilst they fawn and cringe to it. Thus the interests of England,
and English pride, are trampled in the dust. Such a man is Richard,
and such a man is like a loadstone to the natives. Were he in no
authority the country would flock to him and obey him of their own
accord from his own personal influence amongst them.</p>

<p>But this is exactly the man who does not suit the present <i>Wali</i>
and his creatures, upon whose misrepresentations and falsehoods the
Porte has demanded his recall; it is no secret, for all Syria is ringing
with it, and the <i>Wali</i> has it proclaimed in the bazars. I may add
that all Syria is looking on with anxiety and distress lest he <i>should</i>
be removed. No other class of man could hold his own against the
present local Turkish authorities, and they would treat him like a
kind of upper servant. If the Porte knew its own interests, it
would ask to keep Richard, and discharge its own faithless <i>employé</i>.
That troubles will follow his removal, I may safely prophesy;
and that his successor will be insulted in the streets, and compelled
by terror and sickness to run away from his post, is very possible.
That is what we may come to. Let the name of England nevermore
be mentioned&mdash;let her sons be incorporated with the Turkish subjects,
whilst Prussians and the French keep their proper position and their
national dignity.</p>

<p><i>P. S.&mdash;A month later Mohammed Rashíd Pasha</i> was <i>recalled, and
Richard was in England.</i></p>

<p><i>This, then, was the moment to press for the immediate return of the
twelve unfortunates exiled to Murzuk, and to impress upon the Ottoman
Authorities, who, since the death of Russia's friend, Aali Pasha, the
Grand Vizier of pernicious fame, appear ready to reform a host of
abuses, that the friendship of England can be secured only by scrupulous
fidelity to treaties, especially to those which concern religious toleration.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">An Account of Richard Burton by Salih (nom de plume
of an English Missionary at Damascus).</span></h4>


<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Salihs_Description_of_Richard"></a>Salih's Description of Richard.</i></div>

<p>"Burton was sound at heart. The more I saw him alone the
better I liked him. At Damascus he was truly 'a brave, strong
man in a blatant land.' When you got down through the crusts,
you found a fearless and honest friend.</p>

<p>"But Burton was given to pantomime. He was always saying
things to frighten old women of both sexes, and to make servant-maids
stare. He took great delight in shocking goody people, and
in effecting his purpose he gave free rein to his imagination.
People who knew Burton partially, from meeting him at public
dinners or in clubs, have generally a number of gruesome stories
to retail about his cruelty and immorality. They often say truly
that Burton told the horrible stories against himself. I have no
doubt he did, just as he represented himself in the guise of a
monster to my little boy. At the same time I am certain that
Burton was incapable of either monstrous cruelty or gross immorality.
I go farther, and I state it as my firm conviction that
Burton was constitutionally and habitually both humane and moral.
I knew Burton well, in sickness, in trouble, in disappointment, in his
home, in the saddle, under fire, and in the presence of almost every
condition of savage life, and I have noticed that acts of cruelty
and immorality always drove him into a white heat of passion. A
young English lady had been treated rudely at Damascus by a
Persian, and when Burton failed in securing official redress, I was
in dread for months that he would with his own hand kill the
ruffian if he met him. The scoundrel, however, met his fate at
other hands. Shielding the weak from cruelty and protecting the
poor from oppression, constituted Captain Burton's chief work at
Damascus.</p>

<p>"Noticing the difference between Burton's real character and that
for which he got credit in many quarters, I often asked him how
certain specific stories had originated. It was interesting to learn
how the legends had grown. Some of them had been told of old
Castilian Hidalgos and 'British sea-dogs' before Burton's grandfather
was born. Others were founded on facts, but they had
received so many artistic touches at camp-fires and in mess-rooms
that incidents innocent in themselves had grown to monstrous
dimensions. From observation and much inquiry I have long come
to the conclusion that the wild stories in circulation about Burton
were bogeys, partly borrowed and partly invented&mdash;mere adaptations
and travellers' yarns to shock and stun and create a little boisterous
fun.</p>

<p>"The impatience with which Burton treated my servant revealed
a characteristic that had much to do with his career. 'Genius is
patience,' said Sir Isaac Newton. If this definition be correct,
Burton must have lacked genius. 'The Prime Minister's secret
is patience,' said Pitt. If Pitt be right, Burton had no chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
ever finding his way to the Premiership, for he never learned the
secret. I think Burton was not without genius. He was certainly
a very clever man, but he could not put up with stupidity in others.
I am afraid he sometimes delighted to stick pins in Government
officials who mistook the region of the world in which he was
located, or who failed to apprehend the facts communicated in his
last despatch. I am afraid he never got sufficiently into diplomatic
training as to overlook the weakness of his immediate superiors,
and hence the higher rounds of the diplomatic ladder were not to
be trodden by his feet. He was shuttle-cocked about from one
pestiferous region to another till at last the Foreign Office, in a
lucid moment, sent the Oriental enthusiast to Damascus.</p>

<p>"Burton's quarrel with missionaries was also an open sore. I do
not know the full merits of the original strife, but I believe it was
a somewhat mixed affair. Certain benevolent gentlemen have
always had a tendency to do proxy beneficence as cheaply as
possible. In picking up missionaries they have sometimes been
guided more by the price than the quality. Burton, it seems, came
upon some of these job-lots, and found them jobbing, as was to be
expected, and, with his usual impatience, 'went for them.' Then
a great uproar ensued, in which the original cause was lost sight
of, and Burton received the stamp of an anti-missionary Consul.
The Consular dog had got a bad name, and that was enough for
some.</p>

<p>"When it became known that Burton was destined for Damascus,
there was a kind of panic among the missionaries of Syria, and
active steps were taken to prevent the appointment being carried
out. The Damascus missionaries held aloof from the organized
opposition. The moral character of some of Burton's immediate
Christian predecessors had not been of a sort to reflect much credit
on Christian missionaries, or even on British subjects; and from
the missionary point of view it seemed that a moral Consul who
made no religious professions might, on the whole, prove as satisfactory
as an immoral one who read the service to English travellers
on Sundays. Besides, it was known to be the constant aim of the
Damascus missionaries to steer clear of all diplomatic interference,
and to keep the Consular finger out of their pie. They gave Burton
a cordial welcome as their Consul, but they also gave him clearly to
understand that any action of his, friendly or unfriendly, bearing on
their work, would be regarded by them as an impertinent and
unfriendly act.</p>

<p>"Burton appreciated their kindness, and frankly accepted their
conditions, and missionaries and Consul maintained the most cordial
relations, and it was understood that the whole missionary body at
Damascus deeply regretted Burton's recall. One fact regarding this
agreement may be noticed. The restless and energetic Burton
maintained the compact in the spirit, but broke it in the letter. He
visited all the mission schools in the most gracious manner, examined
the children thoroughly, and afterwards made some valuable suggestions
to the missionaries as to the perfecting of their educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
organizations. He ever after spoke of the teachers and the schools
with great cordiality and unstinted praise.</p>

<p>"The other missionaries of Syria, with solitary exceptions, maintained
their attitude of hostility to Burton, and never lost an opportunity
of speaking against him, and some of them not only embellished
old stories to his discredit, but invented new ones, <i>furor
ministrat arma</i>, to prove his deep-seated hostility to the missionary
cause. Many influential travellers pass yearly through Syria, deeply
interested in the splendid educational and religious efforts that are
being made to elevate that land. Everywhere they heard of the
anti-Christian Consul, and the constant drip made a deep impression.
Almost the only honest and praiseworthy efforts being made to lift
the Holy Land out of the slough of Oriental degradation stood to
the credit of the missionaries, and it was intolerable that their
efforts should be thwarted by a British Consul.</p>

<p>"Burton might, by patience and well-doing, have worn down and
outlived the hostility of these missionaries, but he had the misfortune
to come into sharp conflict with the Jews, and he had thus
on his flank an active, persistent, and powerful enemy.</p>

<p>"It would be interesting to narrate how a number of Russian and
other Jews at Damascus became British subjects, but the by-paths
and crooked ways would be too long and intricate for our space.
Burton found himself the official head and protector of a colony of
British Jews. Some of these were men of great wealth and affluence,
and it was well known that the official virtue of helping them was
seldom left to be its own reward.</p>

<p>"Burton, though always posing as an Oriental, thought fit to hew
Oriental prejudice against the grain. He might have seen his
beautiful wife flashing in brilliants, roped in pearls, and riding the
best blood Arab of the desert; but he threw away all these tokens
of appreciation in obedience to an occidental prepossession in
favour of common honesty.</p>

<p>"Burton found that his Jews were living by usury. Some of
them were known to charge as little as thirty per cent., but rates ran
up to sixty, or more. 'His mouth is full of water<a name="FNanchor_6_178" id="FNanchor_6_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_178" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and he cannot
bark' is a common Arab proverb, but Burton had nothing in his
mouth, and he barked ferociously. His official duty was to urge the
recognition of British claims, and insist on their being paid. That
was the form that 'law and order' took at Damascus. What did
it matter if the people were starving! At the word of the Consul
a band of Bashi-Bazouks would swoop down on the defaulting
villagers, eat their food, lie in their beds, insult their wives and
daughters, until the usurer was satisfied. Should the villagers be
unable to pay, they were not only evicted, but driven like cattle to
prison, there to rot till they had paid the uttermost farthing. Burton
did not like the business. He grew fierce, declared in the strongest
language at his command that he would not be 'Bumbailiff' in such
transactions. I am inclined to think that in this case, as in most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
others, Burton's impatience led him into doing the right thing in the
wrong way. He was indignant, his blood was up, and on being
asked gently what was the use of a Consul at Damascus if he did
not enforce British claims, he lost the composure befitting the
diplomatic service.</p>

<p>"The storm broke. The <i>Alliance Israelite</i> took up the case of
'<i>poor Israel</i>.' Noble, and humane, and generous Jews in England
ranged themselves on the side of 'their persecuted brethren.' Some
of them would have been more fierce than Burton had they known
the truth. Correspondence followed, and the archives of the Foreign
Office now contain Burton's splendid vindications, which may some
day see the light."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Letters_showing_the_State_of_Syria_after_his_Recall"></a>Letters showing the State of Syria after his Recall.</i></div>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Civil Service Gazette</i>.</h5>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have just seen some letters from Damascus, from which
I learnt a few facts that may interest you with reference to the recall
of Captain Burton.</p>

<p>"The Consulate was left in charge of Mr. Jago, who, however,
was so alarmed at certain demonstrations of dissatisfaction on the
part of the natives that he prudently took advantage of an opportune
fever, and left the town and the Consulate to take care of itself.
The English Government is, therefore, entirely unrepresented in
Damascus.</p>

<p>"The Kurds who inhabit the suburb of Damascus, called the
Salahíyyeh, say that now Captain Burton has gone, there is no one
who can protect them from the extortions of the Governor-General,
and have notified their intention of leaving <i>en masse</i>. As they are
about ten thousand fighting men, they will not improve the pacific
aspect of the country when they are let loose over it, feeling that
they have no protector but their sword.</p>

<p>"The Mohammedans, whose 'fanatical aversion to Captain
Burton' is the ostensible pretext for his recall, have been holding
mass meetings, and even praying publicly in the mosques that God
will send him back to them. Letters are flowing in every day from
village sheikhs and Bedawin chiefs, asking that he may return to
Damascus, as there is no one else to whom they can appeal for
help or succour.</p>

<p>"So strong is the feeling, that Mrs. Burton was obliged to slip
away secretly, as the people wished to retain her as a hostage in
order to make sure that Captain Burton would go back to them.</p>

<p>"In addition to these facts, which I can vouch for, I can tell you
that, from my own experience of the country, I feel sure that
Captain Burton's absence will be a source of great inconvenience
(to put it mildly) to intending travellers this next winter. If you
have any friends who propose visiting Syria, you cannot do better
than advise them not to do so, as there will assuredly be troubles
before long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot pretend to enter into the real reasons for this blunder
on the part of the Foreign Office (though they are not hard to
guess), but of one thing I feel assured, and that is that the mistake
would never have been made had Lord Stratford de Redcliffe been
still at Constantinople.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Threatened Troubles in Syria.</span></h4>


<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Standard</i>.</h5>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Forewarned will not be forearmed in this case, for the
mischief is half done already by the actions of her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>"I came to Syria in February last with a special mission from
the Palestine Exploration Fund. I have since been travelling over
the length and breadth of the land, and this, with several years'
previous acquaintance with the East, enables me to see more of
the real state of the country than falls to the lot of the ordinary
tourist.</p>

<p>"In the early spring I found Syria in an abnormal state of excitement,
arising from many causes. That excitement has gone on
increasing, chiefly for five reasons: 1. The injustice and rapacity
of the Governor-General (<i>Wali</i>), Mohammed Rashíd Pasha, who
now misgoverns Syria. 2. The agitation kept up by Egypt, with
whom Syria and its Governor sympathize only too strongly, and with
whom they will act the moment opportunity offers. 3. The ruin
of the peasantry, crushed by exorbitant taxes, starved by a bad
season, and devoured by Jewish money-lenders. 4. The way in
which the <i>Wali</i> pits sect against sect for his own political ends; and
in this land, where party feeling runs so high, nothing is easier.
And, 5. The strong Christian movement, none the less strong for
being under the surface&mdash;this has already been noticed in some
English papers.</p>

<p>"There was but <i>one</i> man in Syria who both saw and protested
against the many and glaring acts of injustice done by the <i>Wali</i>,
and this was her Britannic Majesty's Consul at Damascus, Captain
R. F. Burton, whom her Majesty's Foreign Office have thought fit
to remove, giving ear to the tale raised two years ago, by certain
missionaries and others, that Moslem fanaticism was working against
him. Knowing the people and the country as well as I do, I
hesitate not one moment to say that this is a deliberate lie (and
I am ready to prove it such) invented by Captain Burton's enemies.
Few men, if any, would have got on as well as he has with all
classes here, Mohammedans and Metaweli, Greek Catholics and
Syrians, Protestants and Latins. He visited and was visited by the
religious sheikhs, and especially by the Emir Abd el Kadir of
Algerian fame. This prince is looked upon as the leader of Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
religion here. These facts are sufficient to show how false
is the plea of Captain Burton's not being able to deal with Mohammedans
on account of their fanaticism. Only to-day I have heard
numbers of Moslems deplore his removal, which pleased only the
<i>Wali</i> and his creatures, and a few Jews engaged in nefarious usury.
I dwell upon these points, as I feel convinced that unless his
successor be a man of <i>his</i> stamp&mdash;which will be hard to find&mdash;he
will sink to that state of subserviency to the <i>Wali</i> to which the
Consuls of other nations at Damascus have sunk. They are weak
and timid, and completely under the <i>Wali</i>. The English Consul
was the only man of independence, but now that Syria is becoming
of vital importance to us on account of the Euphrates Valley Railroad,
our name and <i>prestige</i> must go, through her Majesty's Government
recalling, at the instigation of a Turkish Pasha, the only man
fit to represent Great Britain in Syria. The <i>Wali</i>, having succeeded
by his vile intrigues in displacing one of the most efficient of her
Majesty's Consular officers, will feel that there is no one to check his
malpractices; the peasantry, sooner or later, must rise; the great
Christian movement will be crushed, not without bloodshed, for the
converts now number many thousands of resolute men of all classes,
and we must be prepared for the worst. I venture to predict that
before many months have passed, the troubles of Syria will have
drawn upon her the eyes of Europe, and when blood has been shed
England will see the error she has committed in throwing her
influence here to the dogs, and obeying the wishes of Rashíd Pasha,</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Damascus Consulate</span>.</h4>


<p>"The following letter, to which we have alluded in a leading
article, on the subject of Captain Burton's recall, has been addressed
to the Editor of the <i>Times</i>, by a well-known Syrian traveller:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;In a letter I addressed to you, dated August 17th, on the
state that Syria, especially in the Damascus district, was likely to
fall into in consequence of the recall, from his post as Consul at
Damascus, of the only man who had the courage to resist and check
the malpractices of the notoriously corrupt and cruel Governor-General
Mohammed Rashíd Pasha, I predicted that troubles would
quickly ensue. On the 18th of August&mdash;the day that Captain Burton
left Damascus&mdash;a raid was made into the Christian quarter by
Mustafa Bey, Mir Alai of Zabtiyeh (Chief of Police), a most
fanatical Mahomedan, with two hundred men, for the purpose of
arresting certain Moslems suspected of a leaning to Christianity,
and who had been decoyed from their own quarter by a police spy,
Mahmud Bey Adham, a man who had by some means become
possessed of their secret. Happily, these suspects were able to take
refuge in the house of an English consular dragoman just as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
were being arrested, and though the <i>gérant</i> of her Majesty's Consulate
ordered them to be given up, yet the matter became so public
that the <i>Wali</i> feared to proceed to extreme measures, and released
them after a day's imprisonment. The affair, however, will not stop
here, though it may lie dormant awhile.</p>

<p>"On August 23, three days after Captain Burton's leaving Beyrout,
the Protestant missionaries were prevented by the <i>Kaimakam</i>
(Governor) from making some small additions to their school at
Rasheyya. The Rev. Messrs. Wright and Scott requested the <i>gérant</i>
of her Majesty's Consulate to procure them an order from the
Government to enable them to go on. A so-called order was
immediately procured, but, of course, it was utterly useless; a
second produced no better effect.</p>

<p>"This is but the commencement, yet it serves to show the way
in which English missionaries will be hindered, and how English
influence is to be crushed. It would be, to any one unacquainted
with Syria, an incredible matter if I were to say how our national
<i>prestige</i> has fallen since the last ten days. I have some twenty
letters from Moslem sheikhs of towns and villages, religious sheikhs
and men of influence, as well as from Druzes and Christians, which
I have been asked to forward to Captain Burton, as the writers
think that their urgent entreaties may favour his return.</p>

<p>"The Government organ, <i>El Hadikat el Akhbar</i>, has written a
most shameful article on Captain Burton's recall, stating that he
was not only on bad terms with the authorities, but also with his
colleagues and all British-protected Jews, and other lies equally
base. A few Jews, whom he refused to help in scandalous and
illegal transactions, of course detest him, and have been secretly
aiding the <i>Wali</i> against him. A most fulsome article, too, appeared
in another paper, <i>El Suriva</i> (The Syria), from the pen of the <i>Wali</i>
himself in praise of the gentleman now in charge of her Majesty's
Consulate here.</p>

<p>"I fear to take up too much of your valuable space by dilating
on the subject, but I am every day more convinced that there will
be great trouble in this unhappy land of misrule.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Revival of Christianity in Syria</span>.</h4>


<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Tablet</i>.</h5>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have just seen the account published in the <i>Tablet</i> of
the 16th and 23rd of September, of the revival of Christianity in
Syria. I can only say that you have an exceedingly well-informed
correspondent, but one who seems hardly aware what enormous
proportions this movement is assuming in the districts of Hums,
Hamáh, and even Aleppo. The number of these diverts from Islam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
is almost impossible to calculate, but I believe that in the whole, of
Syria twenty to twenty-five thousand is a moderate computation.</p>

<p>"Now that Rashíd Pasha, of infamous memory, is removed from
Syria, can nothing be done to bring back the twelve Sházlis banished
to Africa? Will neither England nor any other Christian Power
say one word in their favour? Is the policy of maintaining the unity
of Turkey to be so strictly adhered to, that not even a harsh word
is to be said to her though she deliberately breaks her treaties and
solemn obligations: when, after promising religious freedom to all
her subjects, she invariably persecutes those who dare to leave the
religion of Mohammed, not perhaps directly, but by some subterfuge,
as bringing against the so-called 'renegades' a charge of evasion
from conscription, or desertion from the army.</p>

<p>"Hoping that your advocacy may do something to bring about
the return of these twelve martyrs, whose wives and families would
have been starved here long ago had it not been for the liberality of
their co-sectarians,</p>

<p>"I remain, Sir, etc.,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Chas. F. Tyrwhitt-Drake</span>.</p>

<p>"Damascus, November 13."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard wrote at the end of his time in Syria, just before his recall&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My time here is marked and rendered bitter by contact with
tyranny and an oppression which even this land of doleful antecedents
cannot remember. The politics of the unworthy <i>Wali</i>, Rashíd Pasha,
are alternately French and Russian, and, like all Orientals educated
in Europe, he hates Europeans. I have been brought into collision
with him, by his utterly ignoring the just claims and rights of British
subjects and <i>protégés</i>, and he was supported by those whose duty it
was to oppose him, so I had to battle alone with hands bound."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on, after his recall, he writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But they, his powerful protectors, failed, and truth from my poor pen
and tongue prevailed, and Rashíd was recalled in disgrace and degradation,
and threatened with irons and fetters. Every measure which I
had ventured to recommend during my time was ordered to be carried
out. The reform was so thorough and complete that her Majesty's
Ambassador at Constantinople was directed officially to compliment
the Porte upon its newly initiated line of progress. But Pashas soon
fall into bad ways, and it is always the case of 'new broom.' The
irony of events is extraordinary. Damascus is the civil, military,
and ecclesiastical Capital of the country, the head-quarters of the
Government and the High Courts of Appeal, the residence of the
chief dignitaries, where the Consul-General ought to live, and the
Vice-Consul for the shipping duties at Beyrout. But Beyrout is
safe; Damascus is not always so. Persia has observed this long ago,
and have a Consul-General. Russia, Prussia, France, and Italy do
not speak to the Capital through Vice-Consuls, but Consuls; yet, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
gratify the F.O.'s most <i>un</i>distinguished servant Mr. Eldridge, as soon
as I was gone, a Vice-Consul was appointed for the Capital&mdash;a creature
of his own. Therefore, to the detriment of British interest, to the
injury of English residents, missionaries, and school-teachers, we
took rank after Spain, Portugal, and Greece, because their representatives
are often <i>rayyàhs</i>, or subjects of the Porte, and take
precedence of the British Vice-Consul. Yet the English public is
now surprised to hear from my successor that English travellers
have been made prisoners at Kerak."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Interval_I_remained_as_a_Hostage"></a>The Interval I remained as a Hostage.</i></div>

<p>I must now return, and finish my own Eastern career, more for
the sake of showing the goodness of the Syrian heart, than for any
other interest. I am bound, though late, to bear testimony to them.</p>

<p>After seeing Richard off, I had a cold eight hours' drive over
the Lebanon, arrived at the <i>khan</i> at Shtora, found my horse in
excellent condition, and slept for a few hours. Early in the morning
I rode to see Miss Wilson, who kindly insisted on my remaining
a day with her. Mr. Tyrwhitt-Drake, a <i>kawwás</i>, and servants
and horses, met me here, and escorted me back to Bludán;
but we lost our way in the mountains, and had an eleven hours'
hard scramble. I was ill, tired, and harassed, and was thankful to
find my friend Mrs. Rattray, who came over to keep me company.
She was as much troubled as I was myself. I do not care who
says to the contrary, but the world <i>in general</i> is a good place; for,
although a <i>few</i> bad people make everything and everybody as
miserable as they can&mdash;permitted, I infer, by an all-wise Providence,
like mosquitoes, snakes, and scorpions, to prevent our becoming too
attached to this life, and ceasing to work for the other, where they
cannot enter&mdash;the general rule is good, and whoever is in trouble,
as I have said, will always meet with kindness, comfort, and sympathy,
from some quarter or other.</p>

<p>I had every right to expect, in a land where official position is
everything, where love and respect accompanies power and Government
influence, where women are of but small account, that I should
be, morally speaking, trampled underfoot. I do not know how to
describe with sufficient gratitude, affection, and pleasure the treatment
I met with throughout Syria. The news spread like wild-fire.
All the surrounding villages poured in. The house and the garden
were always full of people&mdash;my poor, of course, but others too.
Moslems flung themselves on the ground, shedding bitter tears, and
tearing their beards, with a passionate grief for the man "whose
life" they were reported to wish to take. The incessant demonstrations
of sorrow were most harassing, the poor crying out, "Who
will take care of us now?" The Moslems: "What have we done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
that your <i>Díwan</i> (Government) has done this thing to us? They
sent us a man who made us so happy and prosperous, and protected
us, and we were so thankful; and why now have they taken him
from us? What have we done? Were we not good and thankful,
and quiet? What can we do? Send some of us to go over to your
land, and kneel at the feet of your Queen." This went on for days,
and I received, from nearly all the country round, little deputations
of Shaykhs, bearing letters of affection, or condolence, or grief, or
praise. These sad days filled me with one gnawing thought&mdash;"How
shall I tear the East out of my heart by the roots, and adapt myself
to the bustling, struggling, everyday life of Europe?"</p>

<p>I broke up our establishment, packed up my husband's books,
and sent them to England, settled all our affairs, had all that was
to accompany me transferred to Damascus, and parted with the
mountain servants. Two pets&mdash;the donkey that had lost a foot,
and a dog that was too ill to recover&mdash;had to be shot and buried in
the garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_leave_the_Anti-Lebanon_Wind_up_at_Damascus"></a>I leave the Anti-Lebanon&mdash;Wind up at Damascus.</i></div>

<p>When all these sad preparations were finished, I bade adieu to
the Anti-Lebanon with a heavy heart, and for the last time, choking
with emotion, I rode down the mountain, and through the plain of
Zebedáni, with a very large train of followers. I found it hard to
leave the spot where I had hoped to leave my mortal coil.</p>

<p>I had a sorrowful ride into Damascus, and I met the <i>Wali</i> driving
in State, with all his suite. He looked radiant, and saluted me. I
did not return his salute, and he told his Staff that he was afraid I
would shoot him. Somebody did that a little later on. He looked
less radiant when the news of his own recall reached him a few days
later, with a special telegram, that if he delayed more than twenty-four
hours, he was to be sent in chains. He fought hard to stay,
and I do not wonder, for he had a splendid position, and had bought
lands and built a palace, which he never lived in; and he had to
give up all his ill-gotten goods, lands, and palace, squeezed out of
the peasantry.</p>

<p>At Damascus I had to go through the same sad scenes, upon a
much larger scale than I had gone through at Bludán. All our kind
friends, native and European, came to stay about me to the last.</p>

<p>I saw that Richard's few enemies were very anxious for me to go,
and that all the rest were equally anxious to detain me as a kind of
pledge for his return. I reflected that it would be right that I should
coolly and quietly perform every single work I had to undertake&mdash;to
sell everything, to pay all debts, and arrange every liability of any
kind incurred by my husband, to pack and despatch to England our
personal effects, to make innumerable friendly adieux, to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
provision or find a happy home for every single being&mdash;man or beast&mdash;that
had been dependent upon us. This was rendered slow and
difficult, as the Government left us <i>pro tem.</i>, without a farthing.
A servant generally gets a month's notice with wages and a character,
but without any defence we were annihilated as if by dynamite. At
last I made our case known to Uncle Gerard, who telegraphed
to the Imperial Ottoman Bank, "to let his niece have any money that
she wanted." Before I left I went and dressed our little chapel with
all the pious things in my possession.</p>

<p>On the day of the sale I could not bear to stay near the house, so
I went up to Arba'in, or "the Forty Martyrs," above our house, on
Jebel Kaysún, about fifteen hundred feet high, and I gazed on my
dear Salahíyyeh below, in its sea of green, and my pearl-like
Damascus, and the desert sand, and watched the sunset on the
mountains for the last time. I also met some Mogháribehs, who
came up to pray there, and who prognosticated all sorts of good
fortune to me.</p>

<p>In one sense I was glad, because I was a kind of hostage, giving
the lie to his enemies. If there had been anything wrong, I should
assuredly have paid the forfeit. I had no anxiety, for though I
had magnificent offers&mdash;two from Moslems to shoot certain official
enemies, as they passed in their carriage, from behind a rock, and
another from a Jew to put some poison in their coffee&mdash;I slept in
perfect security, amongst my Moslem and Kurdish friends, with my
windows and doors open, in that Kurdish village, Salahíyyeh.
Between us and the City was a quarter of an hour's ride through
orchards that were wild and lawless&mdash;at least, in my time, no one
would come there from sunset to sunrise, and timid people, not even
in the day, without a guard. We had the house on a three years'
lease, and my bedroom window and the <i>Muezzin's</i> Minaret were
on a level, and almost joined, so that we could talk to each other.
I used to join him in the "call to prayer," and he used to try not
to laugh. I never missed a pin; I never had anything but blessings.
All my work took me some time, but I resolved, whatever the
wrench would cost me, I would set out the moment it was finished.
My husband being gone, I had no business, no place there; I knew
it would be better taste to leave.</p>

<p>We all began to perceive that the demonstrations were beginning
to be of an excitable nature; the Moslems assembling in
cliques at night, a hundred here and a hundred there, to discuss
the strange matter. They were having prayers in the mosques for
Richard, and making promises of each giving so much to the poor
if they obtained their wish. They continually poured up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
Salahíyyeh with tears and letters, begging him to return, and I felt
that my presence and distress only excited them the more. I left
more quickly because I was informed that my presence was exciting
the people, who lived in hopes of his return, and his non-appearance
was causing an irritability that might break out into open mutiny
and cause another massacre. They were beginning with the usual
signs of meeting in clusters in the streets, in discussing the affair in
the mosques, in the bazaars, in the <i>cafés</i>, and putting up public
prayers for his return.</p>

<p>As half the City wanted to accompany me on the road, and I was
afraid that a demonstration might result, I thought I should be wise
to slip away quietly. My two best friends, Abd el Kadir and the
Hon. Jane Digby el Mezrab (Lady Ellenborough), were with me
till the last, and, accompanied by Charley Drake and our two most
faithful dragomans, who had never deserted me and put themselves
and all they possessed at my disposal, Hanna Asar and Mr. Awadys,
I left Damascus an hour before dawn, sending word to all my friends
that parting was too painful to me.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_get_Fever"></a>I get Fever.</i></div>

<p>I felt life's interest die out of me as I jogged along for weary miles,
wishing mental good-byes to every stick and stone. I had been
sickening for some days with fever. I had determined not to be ill
at Damascus, and so detained. Pluck kept me up, but having
braved the fatal 13th, and set out upon it, I was not destined to
reach Beyrout.</p>

<p>When I reached that part of the Lebanon looking down upon the
sea, near Khan el Karáyyeh, my fever had increased to such an
extent that I became delirious, and had to be set down on the roadside,
where I moaned with pain and could not proceed. Half an
hour from the road was the village of my little Syrian maid. I was
carried to her father's house, and lay there for ten days very ill, and
was nursed by her and by my English maid. Many kind friends,
English and native, came to see me from Beyrout and from the
villages round about.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyrwhitt-Drake took our house, part of the furniture, the
faithful Habíb, and the <i>sais</i>, my two horses, which I could not bear
to sell into stranger hands, the dogs, and the Persian cat, "Tuss,"
who, however, ran away the day after I left, and has never been seen
or heard of since. All the other servants and animals were well
provided for in other ways. I was offered £15 for my white donkey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
but I could not bear to sell him, so I left him also with Mr.
Tyrwhitt-Drake, and he eventually found a good home with our
successor, Mr. Green (afterwards Sir W. Kirby Green), and died.
The bull-terriers also died natural deaths with Mr. Drake. It was a
great relief to know that the former would never become a market
donkey, nor the latter pariahs, nor be beaten, stoned, and ill-used. I
was obliged to sell Richard's <i>rahwán</i>, and I sent it to the purchaser,
the Vice-Consul who succeeded, from the village where I was ill. He
came to pay me a visit. Although the poor horse had only been
there one night, this gentleman told me he had no trouble in finding
the house, for as soon as the <i>rahwán</i> got near the turn leading off
the diligence road, he started off at full gallop, and never stopped
till he reached the door, nor would he go anywhere else.</p>

<p>I went down to Beyrout as soon as I was well enough to move,
and, assisted by Mr. Watkins of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, Mr.
Drake, and Mr. Zal Zal, embarked in the Russian ship <i>Ceres</i>, the
same that had brought me formerly from Alexandria to Beyrout.
As we were about to steam out, an English Vice-Consul in the
Levant gaily waved his hand to me, and said laughingly, "Good-bye,
Mrs. Burton. I have been sixteen years in the service, and I know
twenty scoundrels in it who are never molested; but I never saw a
Consul 'recalled' except for something disgraceful, and certainly
never for an Eastern Pasha. You'll find it's all right; they would
hardly do such a thing to such a man as Burton." We were a
fortnight at sea, detained by fogs and two collisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Eventually_reach_Home"></a>Eventually reach Home.</i></div>

<p>On reaching London I found Richard in one room in a very small
hotel. He had made no defence&mdash;had treated the whole thing <i>de
haut en bas</i>, so I applied myself for three months to putting his case
clearly before the Foreign Office in his own name. I went to the
Foreign Office, where I had thirteen friends, and knew most of its
Masters, and I asked them to tell me frankly what was the reason of
his recall.</p>

<p>Firstly, I was told it had been represented that he was in danger
from the Mohammedans. That was <i>too easily</i> disproved by fifty-eight
letters from every creed, nation, and tongue of the thirty-six
in Syria, from Bedawi tribes, Druzes, Moslems of all categories,
from the Ulemá, from Abd el Kadir; and, like proverbs, this homely
correspondence sprung from the heart illustrated the native character
better than books, and was a fair specimen of local Oriental scholarship.
What the Press and the Public thought about it in various
nations was the same&mdash;in forty-eight articles chiefly from the English
Press and the Levant, and five leaders. All that England has ever done
to <i>him</i> of neglect and slight has never touched him in any man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
mind. He was the brightest gem in his country's crown, and his
country did not deserve him. I went the rounds of my friends
repeatedly in the Foreign Office, and insisted on having a reason
for the recall.</p>

<p>When the Mohammedan question was disposed of, it was found
that it was because "Burton had written a letter to convoke
the Druzes to a political meeting in the Haurán." I asked if I
might have a copy of that letter, and, having kept the <i>original</i>
copy, I was able to put them side by side in the report, showing it
was forged by Rashíd Pasha. He was then accused of opposing
missionary work, because he had written advising a schoolmistress,
in the kindest spirit, to try and prevent her husband entering into
<i>mining</i> speculations: as there was so much cheating going on, he was
afraid he would drop several thousand pounds. "Mining," was <i>somehow</i>
changed to "missionary;" but that fact was disposed of by the
regretful and indignant letters at his recall from all the <i>other</i>
missionaries. He was accused of being influenced against the Jews
because he protected the poor villagers from paying their debts twice
and thrice over to the usurers, who took their money and refused
receipts, leaving nothing to show. Amongst the letters one Jew wrote
home that Captain Burton "was influenced by his Catholic wife against
the Jews." I am proud to say that I have never in my life tried to
influence my husband to do anything wrong, and I am prouder
still to say that if I <i>had</i> tried I should not have succeeded, and
should have only lost his respect. The Jews have never had a
better friend than me. I distinctly divide the usurers from the Jews,
just as I divide the good, honest, loyal half of the Irish Catholic
nation from the Fenians and the moonlighters, who are mostly
Irish living in England and America, and who go over for the
purpose of fomenting disturbance. I have suppressed many a thing
that civilized and idealized Jews would be ashamed to have known
of their lower and fanatical brethren in the East and elsewhere.
He was accused by the Greek bishop of firing into "harmless
Greeks at play," because he fired a shot in the air to call assistance
when we were being stoned to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_gets_an_Amende"></a>He gets an Amende.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Eldridge, who was quite a Russian at heart, went on the
plan of never compromising himself by writing an official order to
Richard; he never wrote him anything but private notes. Richard
said he could not use private notes in official life as proofs. I
thought this very wrong. I saw a <i>plan</i> in this mode of action,
so I used to keep them in a portfolio till wanted, so that when I
put the case together I was able to state the facts very correctly.
I have got several packets of that Blue Book now, if anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
wants to see one. It ended by Richard getting the <i>nearest thing</i>
to an apology that one could expect out of a Government office,
and an offer of several small posts, which he indignantly refused.
In his journal I find he was offered Pará, but would not take it&mdash;"Too
small a berth for me after Damascus."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_become_Penniless"></a>We become Penniless.</i></div>

<p>Shortly after, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; offered him, that if he would go to
Iceland to inspect some sulphur mines, he would pay his passage
there and back, and his expenses, and if he found he could conscientiously
give a good report of the sulphur mines, that he would
give him £2000. He went, and as we were at a very low ebb, and
as Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; did not pay for <i>me</i>, I was left with my father and
mother, which was a very fortunate circumstance, because my
mother died shortly after. I may put in a parenthesis that, though
Richard was able conscientiously to give a <i>splendid</i> report of the
mines, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; did not pay him the £2000. The trip resulted
in a book called "Ultima Thule: a Summer in Iceland"<a name="FNanchor_8_180" id="FNanchor_8_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_180" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (2 vols.),
which was not published till 1875, and his "Zanzibar City, Island,
and Coast" (2 vols., 1872); and he wrote a lecture for the Society
of Antiquaries, a "History of Stones and Bones from the Haurán,"
and "Human Remains and other Articles from Iceland." We had
ten months of great poverty and official neglect (but great kindness
from Society), during which we were reduced to our last £15, and after
that we had nothing to do but to sit on our boxes in the street, for
we had <i>nothing</i>, not a <i>prospect</i> of anything; but we let nobody
know that. He remarked one day when we were out on business&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Lunch, one shilling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soup not filling."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And I noticed afterwards, in his journal, that he had longed for some
oysters, and looked at them long; but he says, "They were three
shillings a dozen&mdash;awful, forbidden luxury!"</p>

<p>At last my uncle, Lord Gerard, asked us up to Garswood, and we
debated if we had a right to accept it or not. I begged him to do
so, as I thought it might bring us good luck. We were alone in a
railway compartment, when one of the £15 rolled out of my
purse, and slid between the boards of the carriage and the door,
reducing us to £14. I sat on the floor and cried, and he sat down
by me with his arm round my waist, trying to comfort me. Uncle
Gerard kept us one month, paid our fare up and down, and, without
knowing that we wanted anything, gave me £25, and from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
time one little help or another came to keep us alive without our
asking for anything. We sold some of our writings, and it was
discovered that some back pay was due to Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Small_Jottings"></a>Small Jottings.</i></div>

<p>During this ten months at home, we saw a great deal of Winwood
Reade, whom all know by his travels in Africa, his many
literary works, of which the cleverest, but the most harmful, was
the "Martyrdom of Man," of which he presented Richard with a
copy, which was carefully treasured till about six months before
Richard's death. He told us the following account of a ghost
story:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a place in Africa or in India (I forget at this distance
of time), where there was a haunted bungalow, and Winwood
Reade was longing to see a ghost, as he was very sceptical about
the existence of such things. In this particular bungalow there was
a room on the ground floor, with folding doors of glass that opened
to the ground, leading out into the compound. Every night at
twelve o'clock these glass doors (being locked) slowly opened
outwards, and the ghosts of three surgeons who had died of cholera
appeared in their winding-sheets. Winwood Reade engaged the
bungalow for the night, it being quite empty, but he could not
induce anybody, for love or money, to go with him. At last he
tempted a black boy, by large promises of money, to pass one night
there, and the boy said <i>if he might sleep on the roof</i> he would, but
nothing would induce him to go inside the house. So they started
forth, and Winwood took with him a good novel, his gun, his
watch, and plenty of brandy and water, and towards eleven o'clock
made himself very comfortable on some cushions in a corner of the
room in full view of the window. As his watch pointed to twelve,
the doors slowly opened, he seized his gun, and in a moment the
three white figures appeared. I said, breathless with excitement,
"And what did you do, Winwood?" He smiled and hesitated,
and said, "To tell the honest truth, I dropped my gun and fainted,
and when I came to I got out of the house as quick as I could,
called the boy, went away, and never went back." He was such a
brave man he could afford to own this.</p>

<p>Richard writes at this time in his journal, "I called on some old
friends, and as I came out of the house I heard the servants whisper,
'Why, Captain Burton looks like an old gypsy.'" This was after his
recall.</p>

<p>We had one very pleasant evening at Lady Marian Alford's. She
had been building her house at Prince's Gate, and Miss Hosmer
had sculptured her fountain; it was the opening night. Lady
Marian wanted to prepare a little surprise for her friends, so she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
made Richard dress as a Bedawin Shaykh, and Khamoor (my Arab
girl) and me as Moslem women of Damascus. I was supposed to
have brought this Shaykh over to introduce him into a little English
society. He spoke Arabic to Khamoor and me, and broken English
with a few words of French to the rest of the party. It was a
delightful little party, and we enjoyed it very much, and&mdash;though
they all knew him&mdash;nobody recognized Richard, which was very
amusing; but presently the Prince of Wales and the Duke of
Edinburgh were announced, and Lady Marian had to go out to
prepare them for this little joke, which amused them immensely, and
so it gradually had to ooze out. There was a delightful supper,
three tables each of eight. Khamoor in her Eastern dress came in
with coffee on a tray on her head, and presented it kneeling to the
Prince and the Duke, and to the others standing. Everything that
Lady Marian Alford did was so graceful.</p>

<p>I see that Richard notices in his journal a correspondence between
himself and the Rev. Herbert Vaughan, D.D. (our present Cardinal),
which I imagine was about the Sházlis. And he also notices that
his name is again left out of Sir Roderick Murchison's address, and
asks, "Why? Old Murchison hates me."</p>

<p>Again speaking of Sir R. Murchison, Richard writes, "He was
anxious to pay due honour to our modern travellers, to Livingstone
and Gordon, Speke and Grant. He has done me the honour of
not honouring me." Later on: "Received a card from him to go
and see him."</p>

<p>We also went to Ashridge, Lord Brownlow's, on a visit to Lady
Marian Alford, which visit we enjoyed immensely, where we met
Lord Beaconsfield and numbers of other delightful people.</p>

<p>He also notices in his journal: "Had the satisfaction of hearing
of Rashíd Pasha's disgrace and removal. Wonder if he wishes he
had not crossed swords with me."</p>

<p>This year was the Tichborne trial, and Richard was subpœnaed
by him, but his evidence did more good to the family. Amongst
other things the Claimant said to Richard, "That he had met me in
Rio de Janeiro, and that I had recognized him as a long-lost cousin;
but, on fixing the dates, it was proved that I had sailed from Rio for
London a week before the Claimant arrived there." We had one
very lively meeting at the Royal Geographical Society. He
writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Rassam stood up about a native message to Livingstone. Colonel
Rigby contradicted, and said there were no Abyssinians in Zanzibar.
They began to contradict me, so I made it very lively, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
I was angry, and proved my point, showing that my opponents
had spoken falsely. My wife laughed, because I moved from
one side of the table to the other unconsciously, with the stick
that points to the maps in my hand, and she said that the audience
on the benches looked as if a tiger was going to spring in amongst
them, or that I was going to use the stick like a spear upon my
adversary, who stood up from the benches.<a name="FNanchor_9_181" id="FNanchor_9_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_181" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> To make the scene
more lively, my wife's brothers and sisters were struggling in the
corner to hold down their father, an old man, who had never been
used to public speaking, and who slowly rose up in speechless
indignation at hearing me accused of making a misstatement, and
was going to address a long oration to the public about his son-in-law
Richard Burton. As he was slow and very prolix he would never
have sat down again, and God only knows what he <i>would</i> have said;
they held on to his coat-tails, and were preparing, in event of failure,
some to dive under the benches, and some to bolt out of the nearest
door."</p></blockquote>

<p>We went a great deal into Society those ten months, and we saw
much of the two best literary houses of the day, where one always
met <i>la haute Bohème</i>, the most interesting Society in London, mixed
with the best of everything, and those were Lord Houghton's and
Lord Strangford's.</p>

<p>About this time we went to visit Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, our then publisher, at
his country-house, where he showed us all that was comfortable and
luxurious, with ten horses in the stable&mdash;everything else to match.
He gave us a large literary dinner, at which Lord Houghton, with his
quiet chuckle, called out across the table, "I say, Burton, don't you
feel as if we were drinking out of poor authors' skulls?" Upon which
Richard laughed, and tapped his own head for an answer.</p>

<p>Richard was very anxious that Alexandretta should be the chief
port in Syria, into whose lap the railway would pour the wealth of
the province, for it is the only good port the country possesses on
the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. Alexandretta, if freed from
its stagnant marshes, would be magnificent; the railway should go to
Damascus, Jerusalem, and Aleppo.</p>

<p>With regard to Sir Roderick Murchison, his journal again contained
the following, speaking of one of his books:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since these pages went to print Sir R. I. Murchison has passed
away, full of years and of honours. I had not the melancholy satisfaction
of seeing for the last time our revered Chief, one of whose
latest actions was to oppose my reading a paper about the so-called
Victoria Nyanza before the Royal Geographical Society; whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
another was to erase my name from the list of the Nile explorers
when revising his own biography. But peace be to his manes! I
respect the silence of a newly made grave."</p></blockquote>

<p>We went, for the first time in our lives, and the last, to a great
banquet at the Mansion House, which amused us very much. Whenever
we wanted to make any remarks at dinner-time we made them
in Arabic, thinking that probably no one would understand us.
Curiously, the people who sat next to us turned round, and said in
Arabic, "Yes, you are perfectly right; we were just thinking the
same thing;" and Richard said, "We spoke Arabic thinking nobody
would understand us;" and they said, "It is most probable that out
of all this huge crowd we are the only four people who happen to
speak Arabic, and happen to sit together."</p>

<p>Another very interesting visit we paid was to the Surrey County
Lunatic Asylum, Wandsworth Common, where the doctor, who was
a friend of my husband's, invited us to spend the day and dine with
him, and he showed us over everything; but I know that I, for
one, felt awfully glad when we left it; some of the faces that I saw
there I can see now if I shut my eyes and think.</p>

<p>In 1872, we were on a visit at Knowsley, the Earl of Derby's,
and we planted there a cedar of Lebanon, which we had brought;
and we went over the alkali works at St. Helen's, very interesting
to Richard, who did not know so much of the "Black Country"
as we did. We then went to Uncle Gerard's, where we met the
Muriettas (now Marchesa de Santurce), and many other pleasant
people. Here we went down some coal-pits (265 fathoms) for further
information, and we planted more cedars of Lebanon and a bit of
Abraham's oak, which we brought from Mamre, some distance from
Hebron.</p>

<p>That year my mother got very ill, and we all assembled in town
to be with her. She had been paralyzed for nine years, and, nevertheless,
had been strong, active, and cheerful, and enabled in some
fashion to enjoy life. Her strong brain kept her alive.</p>

<p>At this time the public, answering an appeal of mine in the <i>Tablet</i>,
describing the poverty and destitution of the Syrian Inland Churches,
sent me wherewith to furnish six of them, which has never been
forgotten out there.</p>

<p>In 1872, poor General Beatson died at New Swindon. Richard
sent thirty-two species of plants from the summit of the Libanus
to the British Museum; and this year he got the news from Syria
that he had gained his cause about the stoning at Nazareth. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
Greek Bishop had brought an action against him before the Tribunal,
and Richard won it with honour.</p>

<p>He wrote and lectured on the "Stones and Bones of the Haurán,"
March, 1872, and "Human Remains in Iceland" in late 1872.</p>

<p>I attended the Tichborne trial, and saw Sir John Coleridge
examine my cousin, Katty Radcliffe. Richard whispered to me,
"The next thing plaintiff will do, will be to call himself Lord
Aberdeen." I came home from there, and found the other brother,
Father Coleridge, S.J., giving my mother Communion. At this
time, too, we attended all the learned societies, where Richard
generally made speeches. We also went down to the Duke and
Duchess of Somerset's, where we met Lady Ulrica Thynne, the
Brinsley Sheridans, and afterwards, at their house, brilliant and
fascinating Mrs. Norton.</p>

<p>Charles Reade, the well-known author, who was a great friend of
ours, gave us a delightful dinner and pleasant evening, asking a
great many actors and actresses to meet us. Sir Frederick Leighton
began to paint Richard on the 26th of April, and it was very
amusing. Richard was so anxious that he should paint his necktie
and his pin, and kept saying to him every now and then, "Don't
make me ugly, don't, there's a good fellow;" and Sir Frederick kept
chaffing him about his vanity, and appealing to me to know if he
was not making him pretty enough. That is the picture that Sir
Frederick has now, and is going to leave to the nation; and both
Richard and I always retained the pleasantest memory of the
many happy hours we passed in his studio. Richard was examined
on the Consular Committee, and made them all laugh. He complained
that the salary of Santos had been very inadequate to his
position; he had been obliged to use his own little capital to supplement.
He was asked how his predecessor (a baronet) had managed,
and he answered, "By living in one room over a shop, and washing
his own stockings." Richard attended the Levée on May 13th.</p>

<p>We went to a Foreign Office party, where Musurus Pasha explained
to Richard why he was obliged to go against him, by the
order of the Turkish Government about Syria, and Richard said to
him, "Well, Pasha, I did not know that you had; but I can tell
you that, though I never practically wish evil to my enemies, they all
come to grief, and you are bound to have a bit of bad luck on my
account." The next day Musurus Pasha fell down and broke his
arm. It is an absolute fact that everybody who did my husband an
injury had some bad luck.</p>

<p>Richard tried to get Teheran, which was one of the places that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
he longed for and was vacant, and we knew that three names were
sent up to her Majesty for approval; but we also knew, <i>sub rosa</i>,
that Mr. (afterwards Sir Ronald) Thompson, a personal friend in their
youth of Mr. and Mrs. (afterwards Lord and Lady) Hammond, of the
Foreign Office, was to get it.</p>

<p>I brought out "Unexplored Syria" (2 vols.), in which Richard
and I and Charley Drake collaborated, on the 21st of June, 1872,
while Richard was in Iceland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Death_of_my_Mother"></a>Death of my Mother.</i></div>

<p>Richard sailed on the 4th of June from Leith for Iceland. The
5th of June was one of my most unhappy days. I got up early, and
passed the day with my mother. She received Communion at a quarter
to one; at 9.30 p.m. she asked to see everybody. We said prayers
to her, but did not think her in any danger. At eleven some
instinct made me refuse to go home to my lodging. We were
summoned suddenly. I ran in and took her in my arms; she turned
her head round upon my shoulder, looked at me, breathed a little
sigh, and died like a child at a quarter to twelve p.m. All the week
she lay in state, the room dressed like a chapel, with flowers and
candles, and we, her children, passed all day by her, and had all
our religious services in her room. (Richard notes in his journal,
"Poor mother died about midnight, June 5th.")</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, attended by all the people she liked best,
we buried her at Mortlake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_accepts_Trieste"></a>Richard accepts Trieste.</i></div>

<p>At last, Lord Granville wrote to me, and asked me if I thought
Richard would accept Trieste, Charles Lever having died; and he
also advised me to urge him to take it, because they were not likely
to have anything better vacant for some time. And I was able to
send Richard's acceptance of Trieste to Lord Granville on July 15th.
We knew that after a post of £1000 a year, with work that was
really diplomatic, and with a promise ahead of Marocco, Teheran,
and Constantinople before him, that a commercial town on £600 a
year, and £100 office allowance, meant that his career was practically
broken; but Richard and I could not afford to starve, and he said he
would stick on as long as there was ever a hope of getting Marocco.</p>

<p>Finally we were taken into some sort of favour again. Lord Granville
<i>had not understood</i> Richard's letter about wanting to have the
Sházlis baptized, and feared that it might result in a <i>Jehád</i>, or
religious war, if the baptisms had taken place. Richard told him
"he knew it <i>would not</i>." He knew he could carry it through; he was
not a man to risk such a matter. His plan was to buy a tract of
land, to give these people the means of building themselves cottages,
choose their own Shaykh, their own Priest, and make for themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
a little Church. The village <i>was to belong to him</i>, and he would have
put it under the protection of his friends amongst the Mohammedans.
He would have taken no taxes from them, and no
presents or provisions, as other people do, and the consequence is
they would have been now a flourishing colony. <i>That was the real
cause of the recall</i>; and, as I have said before, Richard said, "That
is suffering persecution for justice' sake with a vengeance; but we
won't have anything more to do with this subject until I am free
from an enlightened and just-minded Government in March, 1891."</p>

<p>On the 26th of August I was going a round of country-house visits
in Richard's absence, and arriving at ten o'clock at night at Uncle
Gerard's, met the sad news that our youngest and favourite brother,
the flower of our flock, Jack Arundell, commanding the <i>Bittern</i>, had
died of rheumatic fever between the West Coast of Africa and Ascension,
where he is buried&mdash;that is to say, he did not die of rheumatic
fever, but it was a question of sleep saving him. A very slight dose
of opiate had been administered to him to ensure this boon. He had
never mentioned the peculiarity in our family of being very sensitive
to opiates; he went to sleep and never woke again, to the grief and
distress of all on board. He was only thirty-one years of age, was
bright and good-looking; he was a dashing officer, with his heart in
his profession, and a fine career was before him. He had not had
time to hear of our mother's death before he joined her. It was a
terrible blow to us.</p>

<p>Richard arrived on the 8th of June in Iceland, embarked for
return on 1st of August, and arrived in England from Iceland at
eleven at night on the 14th of September.</p>

<p>On the 5th of October, 1872, the day was fixed for Richard to
have a tumour cut out of his shoulder or back. He had got it from a
blow from a single-stick, when he was off guard and his back was
turned. It was an unfair blow, only the man did it in fun; anyway,
he said so. He had had it for a long time, and it had frequently
opened and discharged of itself, but now it was getting troublesome.
Dr. Bird, of 49, Welbeck Street, performed the operation. It was two
inches in diameter, and from first to last occupied about twelve
minutes. I assisted Dr. Bird. He sat astride on a chair, smoking a
cigar and talking all the time, and in the afternoon he insisted on
going down to Brighton. He did not wish me to go with him, but
I accompanied him to the station. I always liked to wait on him, so
I got him his ticket, had his baggage put in, and took him a place in
a <i>coupé</i> whilst he went off to buy his book and paper, and then I
called the guard. I said, "Guard, my husband is going down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
Brighton. I wish you would just look after him, he is not very well;"
and I gave him half a crown. Presently an old man of eighty hobbled
by on crutches, "Is that him, ma'am?" "No," I said. Next a consumptive
boy came by, "Is this him, ma'am?" "No," I said; "not yet."
Many passed, and of all those who he thought looked as though
they wanted taking care of, he asked the same question, and he got
the same answer. Presently Richard came swaggering along, as if
the whole station belonged to him&mdash;all fencers know the peculiar
walk a soldier has who is given much to fencing and broadsword&mdash;and
I whispered to the guard, "There he is," and I stood by the
carriage till the train went, and I heard him whisper to a comrade,
"She would never ask me to take care of such a chap as that, unless
he was a raving lunatic. I'll take devilish good care I don't go near
him; he would probably pitch me out of the carriage."</p>

<p>After this we had a large family party at Wardour Castle, which
we enjoyed immensely.</p>

<p>A Greek priest from Syria came to see us, and we took him to a
spiritualistic <i>séance</i>. He was dreadfully frightened, and said his
prayers out loud all the time.</p>

<p>On his way up to Iceland he went to see Holyrood in Edinburgh,
and, visiting Queen Mary's room, exclaimed, "No wonder she
sighed for France." He went to the Levée held there by Lord
Airlie (the present Earl's father).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Old_Story_of_shooting_People_and_a_Newer_One"></a>The Old Story of shooting People, and a Newer One.</i></div>

<p>Before I finish with Syria, there is a question I want to set at rest
on behalf of both Richard and myself. During my husband's life,
from his journey to Mecca in 1853, till his death in 1890, a period
of thirty-seven years, a story was current about him, which he had no
idea of, and when he did hear it, treated it as a good joke&mdash;that
when he was on the road to Mecca he killed two Mohammedans,
who suspected him of being a Frank and a Christian. He told me
it was absolutely false; and, if any one knew what a horror he had of
any one taking the life of <i>anything</i>, they would not doubt it for
a moment. He would not allow even an animal to be killed, saying
that "we had no right to destroy life." One of his greatest
remorses was shooting a monkey in his younger days; "it cried like a
child," he said, "and I can never forget it." This story did happen to
two Englishmen, who were travelling in the desert about this time;
and who, in consequence of their unfortunate necessity, never
appeared before the public, nor gave an account of their travels.</p>

<p>Now, I mention this incident in connection with Syria (instead of
Mecca), because, after my husband died, his mantle in this respect
descended upon my shoulders. Mrs. Mentor Mott had assured me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
on leaving Syria "that I did not leave a single enemy behind me,"
but it issued from the British Syrian schools long afterwards, that
the cause of my husband's recall was that I had shot two men, and
wounded a third, because they did not stand up and salute me,
and that I was afterwards abandoned and neglected; though it never
reached my ears till five days after Richard's death, and that through
a missionary's letter to the <i>Newcastle Daily Chronicle</i>, owing, I
suppose, to my being a Catholic. He waited twenty years, till my
husband could not contradict it, and then did not lose a single
instant in publishing this utter fabrication. The fact is, these
missionaries get to know a little Syrian Christian Arabic&mdash;some
more, some less&mdash;and perhaps unintentionally they get hold of some
wonderful stories, and make mistakes and mischief. This is the true
story.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Truth"></a>The Truth.</i></div>

<p>It was in a time of great excitement between Moslems and
Christians. I was riding through a village of about thirty-five
thousand Moslems. There was a feud between two local Shaykhs,
the two principal men of the village. The Consulate favoured one
and not the other, who were bullies. I rode through this village
alone, having sent the men in attendance on me to do a commission.
The son of the <i>un</i>friendly Shaykh, a youth of twenty-two, wanted to
commence the row by attacking me&mdash;spat at me, and tried to pull
me off my horse. This in the East means volumes, my position there
being that of a very great personage. If I had been cowardly,
fainted, and screamed, there would not have been a Christian left
alive by the evening in that village. In fact, as it was, all the
villagers were upon their knees in deprecation of the outrage, but
were afraid to interfere with the village bully; so I reined in my
horse, and slashed him across the face with my hunting-whip, and
he howled and roared as if he were about five years old. The noise
brought my men up sharply, whom he had not seen, having thought
I was alone; seeing what was going on, they flung themselves upon
him, and I think he was very sorry for himself when they had done
with him. There was a general scuffle, in which somebody's pistol
went off in his belt, because they have the bad habit of keeping the
trigger down on the hammer, instead of at half-cock; but the ball
fortunately went into a wall, and nobody was hurt.</p>

<p>When I got home, a strong body of people from the village
came up to tell me that the youth, to revenge his beating, had
collected all the most riotous people of the village and was coming
up at night to burn our house (Sir Richard Wood's house in the
Anti-Lebanon, by the way, which he lent to Richard). I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
enough people about me for defence, my husband having ridden a
little distance in the desert and taken most of our men; so I sent a
mounted messenger over to the <i>Wali</i>, and the next morning at dawn
I was horrified at my husband's confidential Afghan, in full <i>kawwás</i>
uniform, armed to the teeth, coming to tell me that my horse
was saddled at the door, and that I must get up and ride down to
the plain; he would explain as we went. I found the plain covered
with troops, who saluted me as I rode down, and then the Colonel
rode up to me, and told me that the <i>Wali</i> had ordered him to burn
and sack the village. I told him that if he did such a thing my
husband and I would leave the country at once; that these
things were quite contrary to our English ideas. He said, "Then I
put myself at your orders." I told him that since he was so kind
as to let me have what I wanted, he was to assemble the principal
Moslems of the village, and to bind them over by an oath not to
touch the Christians, who were chiefly very poor, Greek Orthodox
by religion, and Fellahín of the Anti-Lebanon, and he should take
the youth and put him in prison for a while&mdash;say, a month.</p>

<p>This was carried out, and at my request he drew off the troops,
and there was great rejoicing in the village. For this conduct, for
which the writer to the <i>Newcastle Daily Chronicle</i> has induced many
people to believe that my husband was recalled, I received a complimentary
letter from the Consul-General, Mr. Eldridge, who did
not like me because I hated his way with Richard, and the thanks
of the Governor-General, the Wali Rashíd Pasha, for having saved
them a great deal of trouble, both then and in the expected riot
which Richard prevented. Richard was also very pleased with me.
I should be ashamed to mention these things, but I do not mean to
die and to leave any attack upon my husband not cleared up, nor
any on myself, if I happen to hear of them.</p>

<p>When the youth was let out of prison, he became my most devoted
servant. The year after we left, his mother, who was very fond of
me, did some trifling thing which he had forbidden her; they say
it was selling eggs in the market. His father was absent, and, be
the offence what it may, we received a letter to tell us that he called
his mother into the courtyard, assembled the household, and with
his own hands he strangled her, and buried her in the courtyard
under the stones. I never heard whether his father said anything
when he came home, but I did hear that while she was dying, she
extended her arms to our house, and that she called piteously, "Ah,
Ya Sitti! ah, Ya Sitti! if thou wert here this abomination never
could have been done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span></p>

<p>It is monstrous for any missionary of the British Syrian schools
or otherwise, to pretend that my husband was recalled, because I
defended myself against the man who attacked me. The real cause
was very different; it was his one endeavour to do what England
professes to admire (theoretically, anyway), what Richard did in
practice, namely, sacrifice himself for Christianity's sake!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Difficulty_of_English_Officials_doing_their_Duty"></a>Difficulty of English Officials doing their Duty.</i></div>

<p>And here I must be allowed a by-word. People in small official
life are always subject to these trials, and, knowing this, how careful
a Minister at home should be in listening to complaints! The lower
an officer's grade, the lower the people he has to contend with. The
Consul deals with all classes; when he rises to be Minister or
Ambassador, he is above the mob, which cannot touch him. The
enemies of the Consul will crawl in the dust to the Minister. Meantime
the junior official has to run the gauntlet of the mud pelted at
him, and if his Chief at home listens to it, a weak man dare not do
his duty for fear of losing his post; the strong man does his duty,
but he knows he has no chance of rising. Only the bad man
succeeds.</p>

<p>He arrives at a new place, and all the bad people make a dead set
at him to take up and protect their evil doings and to join them
against their local enemies. If he does it he is upheld by them, but
loses caste with the decent classes; if he does not, they form a
cabal, and even pay people to write home complaint after complaint
against him, till the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who knows
nothing of these matters, says, "There must be something wrong
about this man, or I should not get bad reports of him right and left.
It is evident he won't do for the place." He recalls his good, honest,
brave servant, who was doing his Master credit, and he puts him on
a shelf to pine in useless inactivity, and breaks his spirit, and sends
out another, who naturally says, "I am duly warned what to do. I
will take care not to do what my unfortunate predecessor did, but
the reverse." He has learnt that the "decent people" only looked
on, or if one or two did take his part, they were not believed, or not
listened to. He does as the others bid him&mdash;"wins golden opinions"&mdash;and
the Minister at home thinks it is all as it should be. Who
shall blame the man? He has, perhaps, a wife and children to
support, and he yearns for promotion. If he sees but one road to
his Chief's favour, that of "hearing no complaints of him," what
shall he do? What consolation has he when he is driven out of the

<p>I have seen many cases of this kind during thirty years of
Consular life, and personally I was always acting the part of
Job's wife, but unsuccessfully. Richard had no chance of rising
to his proper position; he was much too good. The "light of
God" was upon him. The Home Authorities heard all the complaints;
<i>he</i> did not report to them the good he did, but <i>I</i> will cry
it from the house-tops until all hear it. He gained respect and
influence over all classes. All the good and the poor loved and
trusted him; the bad feared him. He had pre-eminently the Divine
gift of pity. He had some talisman for attracting the people; and
when they got a written order from him, they would kiss it and put
it on their heads as if it were a Sultan's Firman. He was more than
equal to his position if he had been only commonly backed up at
home.</p>

<p>With so many races, creeds, and tongues, all at variance, in an
Oriental intriguing focus, it is impossible to please everybody. You
cannot well walk down the street without treading upon somebody's
toes. It is difficult for a man who does his duty in a hotbed of
corruption to be universally popular, and there are <i>some</i> whose <i>disapproval</i>
is a <i>proof of integrity</i>. One must have a straight line of
duty. If a person wants you to do something wrong, and you act
uprightly and refuse, they are sure to write to some great personage
at home, to ask them to complain at head-quarters. They never
mention what <i>they asked you to do</i>&mdash;what bribe they offered&mdash;but
invent something against you. If they are listened to, they can
always keep you in hot water, as <i>cela encourage les autres</i>.</p>

<p>Some of us are left in the world to fight our battle. There are
strong souls who can resist all attacks; nothing overthrows them,
nothing can even hurt them. The devil makes war upon the world,
but especially upon them. Nevertheless, it is as hard for a brave
spirit to hold its own, and see its fancied treasures falling away
from it in the hour of need, as for a gallant and successful general,
on the eve of victory, in the turn of the battle, to be deserted by
his troops, and left, in spite of his own qualities, to disgrace and
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Conclusion_of_his_Damascus_Career"></a>Conclusion of his Damascus Career.</i></div>

<p>Richard's character presented a singularity in the Levant, wondered
at by all, condemned by many, approved of or not by those who
would suffer or rejoice under his rule. He was a perfectly honest
man&mdash;I do not allude only to money. His enemies rejoiced at it,
his friends trembled for him, whilst indifferents were only astounded
at his folly. An attempt was made to console him with the hazy
promise of a future, which seemed, however, rather to consist in the
good opinion of good men than in anything tangible or useful. For
him, truth to a principle meant self-annihilation. He had always done
the noble thing, and now, because he did those noble things, he was
virtually regarded as unfit for the very employment for which God
and Nature and his own life had peculiarly fitted him.</p>

<p>My old friend Charles Reade told us that "in less than two
hundred years the first stone of <i>honesty in biography</i>" will have to
be laid, and then he proceeds to relate how <i>his</i> "hero and martyr"
has been treated by the world; how he had earned the gold medal
of the Humane Society twice, and the silver twelve times; how he
has never received either, but is a blind and destitute old man, living
in a chimney corner, deserted and forgotten by the world, and shunned
by those he has saved; how his only public honour is being permitted
to cross a certain bridge without paying the common toll, from whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
waters beneath he has saved so many lives at the risk of his own.
He describes his hero as one of Nature's gentlemen, fit company for
an Emperor, a man without his fellow, who adorns our country. He
was earning thirty shillings a week when charity towards his fellow-creatures
induced him to throw away his sight for the public good,
and the parish allows him three and sixpence a week. He tells us
that he better deserves every order and decoration the State can
bestow than does any gentleman or nobleman whose bosom is a
constellation; "yet," he says proudly, "not a cross or ribbon has
ever ascended from the vulgar level. Why? because," he adds, "this
world, in the distribution of glory, is a heathen in spite of Christ, a
fool in spite of Voltaire." I quote Charles Reade's story to show
that nowadays England does not confer honour on merit in any class
of life. The higher and lower orders share the same fate. Honours
follow a certain red-tape routine, not noble deeds, and often mock
their wearer; whilst many a noble brow looks up to heaven with
patient, uncomplaining dignity, adorned only by God and Nature,
and by a life of chivalrous actions. The English public are, however,
seldom wrong <i>when once they know the truth</i>, and perhaps the
best and truest honour is their good verdict.</p>

<p>Whilst here, we saw the Oriental papers every fortnight, and all
the accounts we read of our old home were of "Arab raids, of insults
to Europeans, of miserable, starving people, of sects killing one
another in open day, of policemen firing recklessly into a crowd to
wing a flying prisoner, and a general fusilade in the streets; of sacked
villages, and plundered travellers." We read of Salahíyyeh spoken
of as a "suburb of Damascus, which enjoys an unenviable reputation;"
of innocent Salahíyyeh men being shot down by mistake
for criminals, "because the people of Salahíyyeh are such confirmed
ruffians, that they are sure to be either just going to do mischief or
just returning from it." That is the place where for two or more years
we slept with open doors and windows, and I freely walked about
alone throughout the twenty-four hours, even when my husband was
absent, and left with Moslem servants.</p>

<p>Having lifted any possible cloud which may have hung over the
real history of Richard's removal from his Eastern post&mdash;the only
suitable one he ever held&mdash;it is unnecessary for me to enter into
any further explanation of the causes of the base detractions from
which he has suffered. His case is not altogether a new one in the
human history, and the true explanation&mdash;the only real explanation&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
it, which can face the light of day, has been admirably expressed
in the lines written by the most brilliant statesman the Foreign Office
ever sent to the East&mdash;the "great Eltchi," whom I and all lovers of
the Orient speak of with admiration, respect, and pride&mdash;Lord Stratford
de Redcliffe&mdash;and which are applicable to Richard in every
sense, except that, so far from ever "spurning the gaping crowd,"
he always sacrificed himself for the poor, the ignorant, and the
oppressed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
